It also places responsibility on the social networks to prevent children from accessing &quot;harmful materials&quot; and it requires parental consent for minors to use any social media. NetChoice represents several tech companies — including social media platforms Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and YouTube — and it sued to block the law on grounds that it violates the First Amendment. A district court ruled in favor of NetChoice, but the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals lifted its temporary block.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Although Justice Brett Kavanaugh denied the application to vacate stay on the appeals court ruling, he also wrote that &quot;NetChoice has, in my view, demonstrated that it is likely to succeed on the merits—namely, that enforcement of the Mississippi law would likely violate its members' First Amendment rights under this Court’s precedents.&quot; He denied the application because NetChoice &quot;has not sufficiently demonstrated that the balance of harms and equities favors it at this time.&quot; This decision means that, at least for now, Mississippi's law will be allowed to stand.</p>\n<p>&quot;Justice Kavanaugh’s concurrence makes clear that NetChoice will ultimately succeed in defending the First Amendment,&quot; <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://netchoice.org/netchoice-confident-the-first-amendment-will-prevail-against-mississippis-i-d-for-speech-law/\">said</a> Paul Taske, co-director of the NetChoice Litigation Center. &quot;This is merely an unfortunate procedural delay.&quot;</p>\n<p>There are several other state laws being assessed at various points in the US legal system.

The key to this is a new case featuring what the company is calling the industry's first patented Cryo Chamber, which puts the PC's liquid-cooled radiator in a separate compartment to prevent hot air from spreading and impacting the rest of the system's thermals. With this arrangement, HP says it was able to reduce temperatures by up to 7.5 degrees Celsius at full load. Meanwhile, thanks to smaller touches like raised feet, vented PCI slots and open vents on the bottom of the case, HP was able to improve GPU temps by another two degrees C.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>But to me, the best thing about the Omen Max 45L is that HP says it's using industry-standard components across the board instead of proprietary parts and fittings like we sometimes see in pre-built systems from major vendors. This means that down the line, if you want to replace or upgrade a specific component, you'll be able to do just that instead of potentially needing to replace the entire computer. And if that isn't enough, the Omen comes with a CPU cooler that has a small built-in display that you can load up with practically any image or short video clip.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, the desktop comes with a fully modular power supply (with up to 1,200 watts), which is a first for the Omen line. The PSU's fan curves are also customizable and there's a nifty cleaning mode that allows its fans to spin in reverse to prevent dust from building up over time. Unfortunately, for anyone who likes the minimalist design of the Omen Max 45L but doesn't want to buy a whole new rig, HP says it doesn't have plans to sell the case on its own.</p>\n<p>Naturally, as the beefiest desktop in HP's gaming desktop family, the Omen Max 45L can be configured with top-of-the-line components including up to an AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D processor, an NVIDIA RTX 5090 GPU, 128GB of DDR5 RAM and 2TB of PCIe Gen5 storage.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"The HyperX Cloud Alpha 2 is HP's latest top-tier wireless gaming headset.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-08/888c67b0-7921-11f0-b39f-f6ea965d9639\" style=\"height: 2000px; width: 3333px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Rutherford for Engadget</div></figure>\n<p>Aside from the Omen Max 45L, HP also has a bunch of refreshed PC gaming peripherals on the way, headlined by the $300 HyperX Cloud Alpha 2 wireless headset. Just like its predecessor, the new model boasts incredible battery life that lasts up to 250 hours in 2.4GHz mode, 53mm drivers and support for dual audio inputs via Bluetooth. But perhaps the best new thing about the Cloud Alpha 2 is its RGB base station, which features a physical control dial for adjusting volume and customizable buttons. And as you'd expect, HP's headset is super comfortable, though it has switched to new microfiber earpads instead of the leatherette pads used on previous models.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, for anyone on a tighter budget there are also two versions of the new HyperX Cloud Flight 2 wireless headset ($130 for the PC/PlayStation version or $140 for the Xbox variant) that come with RGB lighting and removable side panels for extra personalization.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"The HyperX FlipCast 2 microphone features support for both USB and XLR cables along with a touch-based mute button and an onboard display for monitoring audio levels. \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-08/cd2549a0-7921-11f0-a9f7-d811e16048dd\" style=\"height: 2000px; width: 3333px;\" /><figcaption>The HyperX FlipCast 2 microphone features support for both USB and XLR cables along with a touch-based mute button and an onboard display for monitoring audio levels. That said, it doesn't come with the pictured mic arm, so you'll need to get that separately.&nbsp;</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Rutherford for Engadget</div></figure>\n<p>Finally, for folks in the market for a new desktop mic, HP has two offerings there as well: the $230 HyperX FlipCast and the $60 SoloCast 2. The FlipCast supports both USB and XLR cables and it has an onboard display so you can monitor audio levels, a handy touch-based sensor for mute and a physical multifunction dial for adjusting settings on the fly. Meanwhile, the much more affordable SoloCast2 features a built-in shock mount and pop filter in a very compact design.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"For just $60, the HyperX SoloCast 2 microphone offers a built-in shock mount and pop filter in a compact design. \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-08/ac6fdfe0-7921-11f0-9ae3-c47d3ed66d1a\" style=\"height: 2000px; width: 3333px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Rutherford for Engadget</div></figure>\n<p>Sadly, the Omen Max 45L  and the HyperX CloudX Flight 2 headset won't be available until the end of the year in December.

When enabled, the chatbot would, following a question, try to guide the user to their own solution, instead of providing them with an answer outright. Since its introduction in April, learning mode has only been available to Claude for Education users. Now, like OpenAI did with <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/chatgpts-study-mode-will-guide-students-to-an-answer-stey-by-step-180614172.html\">Study Mode</a>, Anthropic is making the tool available to everyone.</p>\n<p>Starting today, <a href=\"http://claude.ai/\">Claude.ai</a> users will find a new option within the style dropdown menu titled &quot;Learning.&quot; The experience here is similar to the one Anthropic offers with <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/introducing-claude-for-education\">Claude for Education</a>. When you turn learning mode on, the chatbot will employ a Socratic approach, trying to guide you through your question. However, unlike the real-life Socrates, who was famous for bombarding strangers with endless questions, you can turn off learning mode at any time.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Notably, Anthropic is also offering two different takes on the feature through <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code\">Claude Code</a>. First, there's an &quot;Explanatory&quot; mode where Claude will generate summaries of its decision-making process as it works, giving the user a chance to better understand what it's doing.</p>\n<p>For those at the start of their coding career or hobby, there's also a more robust option, which is once again called &quot;Learning.&quot; Here, Claude will occasionally stop what it's doing and mark a section with a &quot;#TODO&quot; comment to prompt the user to write five to 10 lines of their code. If you want to try the two features out for yourself, update to the latest version of Claude Code and type &quot;/output-styles.&quot; You can then select between the two modes or Claude's default behavior.</p>\n<p>According to Drew Bent, education lead at Anthropic, learning mode, particularly as it exists in Claude Code, is the company's attempt to make its chatbot into more of a collaborative tool. &quot;I think it's great that there's a race between all of the AI labs to offer the best learning mode,&quot; he said. &quot;In a similar way, I hope we can inspire something similar with coding agents.&quot;</p>\n<p>Bent says the original learning mode came out of conversations Anthropic had with university students, who kept referring back to the concept of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_rot\">brain rot</a>. &quot;We found that they themselves realized that when they just copy and paste something directly from a chat bot, it's not good for their long-term learning,&quot; he said. When it came time to adapt the feature to Claude Code, the company wanted to balance the needs of new programmers with those like Bent who have been coding for a decade or more.</p>\n<p>&quot;Learning mode is designed to help all of those audiences not just complete tasks, but also help them grow and learn in the process and better understand their code base,&quot; Bent said. His hope is that the new tools will allow any coder to become a &quot;really good engineering manager.&quot; In practice, that means those users won't necessarily write most of the code on a project, but they will develop a keen eye for how everything fits together and what sections of code might need some more work.</p>\n<p>Looking forward, Bent says Anthropic doesn't &quot;have all the answers, but needless to say, we're trying to think through other features we can build&quot; that expand on what it's doing with learning mode. To that end, the company is opening up Claude Code's new Output Styles to developers, allowing them to build their own learning modes. Users too can modify how Claude communicates by <a href=\"https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/10181068-configuring-and-using-styles\">creating their own custom prompts for the chatbot</a>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/anthropic-brings-claudes-learning-mode-to-regular-users-and-devs-170018471.html?src=rss"}

Gamescom is the planet's largest gaming event and we're sure to find out about a bunch of interesting new games at the Opening Night Live showcase (and, fingers crossed, maybe get a <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong </em>release date?). Xbox is broadcasting from the show floor across two days, and there will be other presentations that are worth keeping an eye on.</p>\n<p>Gamescom is taking place between August 20 and 24 this year, and we're learning bits and pieces about what to expect from the various showcases. The affair will kick off with Opening Night Live, a showcase hosted by Geoff Keighley that bridges the gap between his two other major events, Summer Game Fest Live and The Game Awards. That will be followed by two days of Xbox broadcasts, the latest edition of the Future Games Show and three days of Bethesda streams.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>There will also be news from Ubisoft on what's next for <em>The Division 2</em>. The company will <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://x.com/Ubisoft/status/1955638110798201174\">host two panels</a> related to the franchise during Gamescom. One will include more info about <em>The Division Resurgence</em> (<a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ubisoft-delays-its-rainbow-six-and-division-mobile-games-until-at-least-april-2025-174035060.html\">a delayed mobile game</a>), as well details about a \"big Division 2 project.\"</p>\n<p>We'll update this preview with more Gamescom details as we get them, and embed video versions of each stream as they become available too. Here's our breakdown of how to watch Gamescom 2025 and what to expect from the event.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-gamescom-schedule\">Gamescom schedule</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Opening Night Live — August 19, 1:30PM ET (pre-show), 2PM (main show)</p></li>\n<li><p>Xbox @ gamescom 2025 Broadcast — August 20, 9AM ET</p></li>\n<li><p>Future Games Show — August 20, 2PM ET</p></li>\n<li><p>Xbox @ gamescom 2025 Broadcast — August 21, 9AM ET</p></li>\n<li><p>Bethesda — August 22-25</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-how-to-watch-gamescom-opening-night-live---august-19-2pm\"><strong>How to watch Gamescom Opening Night Live - August 19, 2PM ET</strong></h2>\n<p><strong>Watch on </strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@gamescom.global/\"><strong>YouTube</strong></a></p>\n<p>Opening Night Live perhaps won't feature as many heavy hitters as Summer Game Fest Live or The Game Awards typically have, but one thing's for certain: Call of Duty fans will definitely want to tune in. The two-hour showcase will feature the \"worldwide reveal\" of <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. </em>We'll almost certainly get a release date here too.</p>\n<p>Given that Microsoft has said <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong </em>will be playable on PC and ROG Xbox Ally X at its Gamescom booth, and the game is still slated to arrive this year, this event seems as good a time as any for us to finally get a release date for that thing — <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/that-one-time-i-played-hollow-knight-silksong-160022483.html\">over six years after we first got to try it out</a>. There will certainly be more eyeballs on ONL than Microsoft's own streams, so that seems like the likeliest bet for any concrete <em>Silksong </em>news at Gamescom.</p>\n<p>You can also expect a trailer for multiplayer RPG <em>Honor of Kings: World, </em>along with <a href=\"https://www.gematsu.com/event/gamescom-2025-opening-night-live\">new looks</a> at <em>Resident Evil Requiem, Silent Hill f, Ninja Gaiden 4, Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion</em> and<em> The Seven Deadly Sins: Origin. </em>You'll get to see the opening cinematic for <em>World of Warcraft</em>'s <em>Midnight</em> expansion as well.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It won't all be game reveals and announcements, though — there'll be a performance of music from <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 </em>featuring composer Lorien Testard and vocalist Alice Duport-Percier. Additionally, you'll get a peek at season two of Prime Video's <em>Fallout </em>series, which will arrive in December.</p>\n<p>We'll be keeping tabs on all the news from Opening Night Live right here on Engadget. Myself, senior editor Jess Conditt and editor-in-chief Aaron Souppouris will be live-blogging our way through ONL. Join us!

(Think about it this way: Would you actually feel safe running Windows XP, a notoriously malware-prone OS that hasn't received a significant security update since 2019, today? I would hope not!)</p>\n<p>So what's a Windows 10 user to do? Let's consider your choices.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-the-best-option-upgrade-to-windows-11\">The best option: Upgrade to Windows 11</h2>\n<p>For most users, the simplest way to move on from Windows 10 is to step up to Microsoft's new OS. <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/windows-11-review-microsoft-mindful-os-200028040-200028741.html\">Windows 11 </a>is a free upgrade for Windows 10 users running the latest 22HS update and who also meet the <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=67071605-d4df-494e-8d9c-c9c236b8bb38&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=1ef2905f-b731-403b-8357-0ea175334b36&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Microsoft&amp;linkText=minimum+hardware+specifications&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5taWNyb3NvZnQuY29tL2VuLXVzL3dpbmRvd3Mvd2luZG93cy0xMS1zcGVjaWZpY2F0aW9ucyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMWVmMjkwNWYtYjczMS00MDNiLTgzNTctMGVhMTc1MzM0YjM2Iiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5taWNyb3NvZnQuY29tL2VuLXVzL3dpbmRvd3Mvd2luZG93cy0xMS1zcGVjaWZpY2F0aW9ucyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAVxHGHrs91w2Kpanl0rPvDovVCqJRYlzrn120q64n5Be&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fwindows%2Fwindows-11-specifications\">minimum hardware specifications</a>. Microsoft isn't asking for much — just a 1 GHz dual-core 64-bit processor, 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage -— but security requirements may be a problem for very old PCs.

Windows 11 relies on the latter for biometric logins, BitLocker data encryption and other security features. If you don't have TPM 2.0, you'll be stuck with Windows 10 until you get a new PC.</p>\n<p>If that all sounds too complicated, <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=1ef2905f-b731-403b-8357-0ea175334b36&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;linkText=Microsoft%27s+PC+Health+Check+app&amp;custData=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&amp;signature=AQAAAUWLMYFxh16drbFAk3euOpr1NYoouaJEY8y0BsGJi6Hu&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fwindows%2Fcheck-if-a-device-meets-windows-11-system-requirements-after-changing-device-hardware-f3bc0aeb-6884-41a1-ab57-88258df6812b\">Microsoft's PC Health Check app</a> can also let you know if your system is ready for Windows 11. And if you've been bombarded by Windows 11 upgrade notifications over the past few years, that's also a not-so-subtle nudge that your PC is likely ready for the new OS. (There are various hacks that can let you install Windows 11 without TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot, but they’re risky and could make your OS installation vulnerable.)</p>\n<p>If you do choose to upgrade, you can expect a relatively painless process. Gone are the days when a Windows upgrade could easily wipe out your entire system. Now you can expect all of your software (and their respective licenses) to carry over, but with yet another caveat for Office suites: Microsoft is also <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365-apps/end-of-support/resources\">ending support for Office 2016 and Office 2019</a> on October 14, 2025 as well. Cloud-based Microsoft 365 apps should be good to go on Windows 11 as well (see below for Windows 10 limitations).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Assuming you've got enough hard drive space to hold the new OS, the upgrade process is merely a matter of sitting back and watching your system reboot a few times. I'd still recommend backing up any essential data before upgrading, though, just in case you run into any issues. (Pairing a cloud-based Microsoft OneDrive backup with a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-portable-ssd-120043652.html\">local hard disk</a> is a good belt and suspenders solution.)</p>\n<div id=\"62e45afdb5c4410a974b97d393ddcbc1\"></div>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-the-pricey-option-buy-a-new-pc\">The pricey option: Buy a new PC</h2>\n<p>If your system is too old to support Secure Boot mode and TPM 2.0, it’s probably just time for an upgrade. (Expert users can find workarounds on YouTube and elsewhere, but you need to be adventurous enough to handle the likes of Github downloads and security overrides.)

While the sweetspot for new PCs tends to be in the $750 to $1,200 range, with current back-to-school promos, you can find very capable laptops and desktops for as low as $500, and occasionally less. But if you're looking for something higher end ($1,400 and up), our <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/best-gaming-laptops-172033838.html\">best gaming laptop guide</a> would be helpful.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-the-risky-option-keep-on-trucking-with-windows-10\">The risky option: Keep on trucking with Windows 10</h2>\n<p>Windows 10 won't self-destruct when its support ends, so you could conceivably just use your older PC until it dies. But that's a risky option since you won't be getting any security updates. All it takes is for one intrepid hacker to find a new security flaw and you could easily fall victim to any number of issues. That includes getting malware, which could slow down performance and leak your data to hackers, or falling victim to a ransomware data theft scheme. And every day past October 14 just raises the likelihood of OS-level vulnerabilities that third-party antivirus software would be ill-equipped to fight off. Trust me – you don't want to do this. At the very least, buy yourself another year to figure things out</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-the-procrastinator-option-pay-to-extend-windows-10s-security-updates\">The procrastinator option: Extend Windows 10's security updates for one year&nbsp;</h2>\n<p>If your hardware can't support the move to Windows 11, you can at least hit the snooze button by subscribing to the Windows 10 extended update (ESU) program. While it was initially announced as a $30 offering, Microsoft has since made it a free option if you <a href=\"https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2025/06/24/stay-secure-with-windows-11-copilot-pcs-and-windows-365-before-support-ends-for-windows-10/\">synchronize your Windows 10 settings</a> to the cloud via Windows Backup, or you could shell out <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/windows-10-users-can-get-extended-security-updates-for-1000-microsoft-rewards-points-170023129.html\">1,000 Microsoft reward points</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As its name implies, the ESU will get you Windows 10 security updates, bug fixes and technical support until October 13, 2026. It also extends support for cloud-based <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365-apps/end-of-support/windows-10-support\">Microsoft 365 apps</a> through August 2026 for individuals and families. Sure, it's only a year of additional support, but that can at least buy you enough time to do more research on a new PC, or wait for a holiday sale. For what it's worth, this marks the first time Microsoft has offered any sort of ESU to consumers. Typically, they're just a way for corporate IT admins to get additional support without migrating to a new OS.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-have-a-tech-question-youd-like-engadget-to-answer\">Have a tech question you’d like Engadget to answer?</h2>\n<p>As tech reporters, the Engadget staff is always answering questions from friends and family about electronics, software, gaming, big tech policies and more.

That was my immediate thought when the company announced its first drone, the A1, from a spin-off brand and team called <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cameras/insta360-spin-off-antigravity-360-degree-video-drone-130048742.html\">Antigravity</a>.</p>\n<p>So, what is the A1? Is it an entry-level device? A camera for creators looking to spice up their videos without years of practice? A competitive POV drone? It’s a bit of all three, but the Antigravity A1 isn’t just a drone. It will eventually launch in a three-part set: the flying unit, OLED Vision goggles and a dedicated Grip motion controller.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>In its current form, the Antigravity A1 weighs around 249 grams (8.8 ounces), which helps it duck around drone license requirements in most regions. (As it’s a preproduction model, this could change a little before it hits retail.) Two ultrawide cameras are positioned on the roof and underside of the drone instead of on the front. It’s like the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cameras/insta360-x5-launch-date-price-hands-on-132439941.html\">Insta360 X5 camera</a> is some sort of cocoon for the Antigravity A1.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Antigravity A1 drone hands-on\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-08/909afc20-7848-11f0-bfdf-530bdf9d71aa\" style=\"height: 1288px; width: 2289px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Image by Mat Smith for Engadget</div></figure>\n<p>With those two camera units, the A1 can capture video in 8K resolution, stretched across a sphere-like canvas from the drone’s point of view. With stitching algorithms that the company has continually improved over five generations of 360-degree cameras, this should result in mostly seamless footage where the A1 never interrupts the view.  The drone itself won’t show up in your video. It’s like the company’s “invisible” selfie stick, but, well, up in the sky.</p>\n<p>The A1 is unlike any other drone I’ve played with — something I learned when I tested a pre-production unit at a Mercedes-Benz race track in Schlüsselfeld, Germany. Naturally, this included high-speed cars, wet conditions and some near-misses.</p>\n<p>Thanks to working at Engadget, I’m a drone dabbler, but Antigravity’s A1 is a different experience from the outset. Controlling the A1 involves strapping on companion goggles and steering it from a first-person perspective, controller in hand. However, unlike other FPV drones, you can look (and move) anywhere you want.</p>\n<div id=\"2224f835e99b412aaf1848c3de7b61da\"></div>\n<p>During roughly 15 minutes of flying time (you can see the highlights here), I found it’s a surprisingly intuitive experience. With other FPV drones, your view is locked to the direction of the camera. Sure, you can rotate rival drones to see elsewhere, like with <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cameras/dji-avata-2-fpv-drone-review-a-cheaper-more-potent-tool-for-creators-130052278.html\">DJI’s Avata</a>, but it’s not the same. Because the A1 streams 360-degree video to the goggles, turning your head will never affect the direction it’s facing. Instead, you’ll just see what’s around the drone as it flies, making it far more intuitive for rookie drone pilots. Better still, you can strafe and move around while looking somewhere else — like video game controls for a first-person shooter.</p>\n<p>This freedom of movement is elevated by the unique A1 controller, which is best described as a blend between a traditional drone controller and a Wiimote. While some of the physical buttons and dials adjust altitude, start/stop video recording and more, steering involves a point-and-click method. When you move your hand out to the right side, a reticle shows up on the goggles’ display. Pressing the trigger then will cause the A1 to shoot out in that direction, an action that Antigravity calls Freemotion control.</p>\n<p>As I mentioned, this means I don’t have to look where I’m going — although it’s better if I do to avoid accidents (or collisions with an expensive Mercedes). If you’ve been intrigued by FPV drones, this is a simpler experience that feels freer, too. You can look wherever you want, not beholden to where cameras are pointed on other drones. I also think I could get friends and family flying the A1 around with minimal training. Speaking of spectators, Insta360 included a clever touch for them: the goggles have an external screen so that onlookers can see what’s happening. There is nothing duller than watching someone else fly a drone without being able to see their POV.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Antigravity A1 drone hands-on\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-08/909ad510-7848-11f0-af5d-8ffc14cca897\" style=\"height: 1153px; width: 2050px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Image by Mat Smith for Engadget</div></figure>\n<p>The A1 is a zippy little drone, presumably thanks to its low weight. But even at this preproduction stage, the resulting video looks better than I thought it would. Plus, it offers substantial versatility if you’re looking for action-packed shots.</p>\n<p>After I tested the A1, Antigravity sent me my video from the drone, so I was about to reframe, crop and reposition the footage. You could even use the same 10 seconds and frame (or crop) to three very different angles. For example, you could extract a tracking shot of the car, a zoomed-in shot of the drone pilot or just the blue skies of Germany all from one clip. That’s the exciting part here.</p>\n<p>Insta360 built excellent editing tools (mobile and desktop) for its cameras in the past, and it plans to do the same for its first drone. An early version of the software wasn’t without its hiccups, but editing was easy enough once I figured out that keyframes would anchor the drone's view. I could then add several keyframes together, tagging objects I’d like to keep in frame or track. Editing my footage started to get oddly enjoyable, and I have <em>never</em> enjoyed that task.</p>\n<p>Another feature the company emphasized is payload detection. While the exact weight limit is still being refined through further testing, Antigravity says the A1 won’t be able to fly if the drone detects it’s carrying something it shouldn’t — a move to further smooth potential license issues. The company also hinted at future accessories and peripherals to expand the A1 experience — something it has successfully done with its action cams and gimbals.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Antigravity A1 drone hands-on\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-08/909afc21-7848-11f0-bb7f-27f1814bb63c\" style=\"height: 1294px; width: 2300px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Image by Mat Smith for Engadget</div></figure>\n<p>Some specs are still a mystery because the drone is a work in progress. To that end, the company is <a href=\"http://www.antigravity.tech/\">opening up applications</a> for a co-creation project, where participants will get a pre-production Antigravity A1 in exchange for offering feedback. Ideas from these testers will be integrated into the final retail version, and the best ones could win a share of a $20,000 prize pool.</p>\n<p>Flying the A1 around a racetrack was the most fun I've had with a drone in a long time. But, with goggles and a dedicated controller included, how much will a flight cost? That might decide whether Insta360’s Antigravity can carve out a place next to DJI’s army of drones.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cameras/insta360-antigravity-a1-drone-preview-hands-on-130034274.html?src=rss"}

This iPad occupies the position of \"best for most\" in our<a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/best-ipads-how-to-pick-the-best-apple-tablet-for-you-150054066.html\"> iPad buying guide</a>, reinforcing that goldilocks analogy. The M3 chip is the main draw here, with Geekbench 6 scores proclaiming it around 16 percent more powerful than the M2 iPad Air, which is no slouch itself.</p> \n<p>Beyond the chip, it has a superior display and speakers to the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/ipad-2025-with-a16-review-no-apple-intelligence-no-problem-132641539.html\">entry-level model</a>, and wider accessory support. You also get the option of a 13-inch display, which is great for artists or anyone who sees the iPad as a viable laptop replacement.</p> \n<p>If there’s an obvious downside to the iPad Air M3, it’s that it doesn't have the nice 120Hz OLED display of the iPad Pro. This is hardly surprising, as Apple often focuses on display tech to differentiate its Pro and non-Pro devices, but it’s probably time the refresh rate on the middle-of-the-road iPad at least jumped up to ProMotion. Face ID is long overdue too. If you can live with these caveats, though, the iPad Air is an excellent option, particularly at this price.</p> \n<p>There are a couple of other iPads on sale at Amazon right now, too, if you think the Air is too much for your needs.

You can also get real-time translation in 13 languages: Arabic, Traditional Chinese, English, French, German, Greek, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese, Spanish, Korean, Thai, Turkish.</p>\n<p>On the audio side, the Vive Eagle has an open-ear setup that &quot;combines large acoustic drivers and virtual bass enhancement to deliver rich, spatial audio while minimizing sound leakage,&quot; HTC said.

The zoom lens could <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/25/iphone-17-pro-max-48mp-telephoto/\">jump</a> to 48MP, which would strengthen its digital zooming / cropping chops.

The company is also expected to roll out new Apple Watch models. 5G and a processor upgrade are <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-10/apple-plans-apple-watch-ultra-3-next-year-with-satellite-texting-and-5g\">expected</a> for the Apple Watch Ultra 3. It may also let you send texts via satellite, handy for those who use it out in the wilderness. Regardless of the details, Apple hasn't launched a new rugged and premium model since 2023 (apart from <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/wearables/theres-no-apple-watch-ultra-series-3-just-a-new-color-and-a-new-band-173236966.html\">a new color</a>), so it's due for an upgrade.</p>\n<p>The Series 11 model is unlikely to depart dramatically from the Series 10. After all, that model introduced a new design, with a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/wearables/apple-watch-series-10-review-legacy-and-sequel-in-equal-measure-120021405.html\">thinner body and larger screen</a>. (And Apple has historically kept those around in three-year cycles.). But a faster chip also seems logical. Perhaps we'll see 5G arrive on the standard wearable, too.</p>\n<p>We may also see the AirPods Pro 3 at the event. It's been about three years since Apple last upgraded its premium earbuds. The new model could also bring some <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/apples-next-airpods-pro-could-offer-heart-rate-and-temperature-monitoring-175757188.html\">biometric sensors to the earphones</a>: an in-ear heart-rate monitor and (maybe) temperature sensing. <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/apples-rumored-live-translation-feature-for-airpods-could-be-coming-with-ios-26-152715034.html\">Live translation is also rumored</a>, although that may not be exclusive to the third-gen model.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/what-to-expect-at-apples-iphone-17-event-090059189.html?src=rss"}

Whether you want a lightweight device to binge your favorite shows, a larger screen for mobile gaming or a portable way to get some work done on the go, a tablet can do it all. They’re also great for keeping kids entertained, managing work tasks or sharing family moments through video calls. When a phone feels too small and lugging around a laptop is just too much, that’s where tablets fit into the mix.<br /><br />For many, the Apple iPad is the go-to choice, and it’s easy to see why with its smooth performance and endless app options. But don’t worry if iOS isn’t your thing — there are plenty of Android alternatives out there, offering the same level of flexibility without locking you into Apple’s ecosystem. Plus, if you’re on a budget, there are more affordable options that still pack a punch. Whether you’re looking for a premium tablet for work, a kid-friendly device with parental controls or just a reliable everyday companion, we’ve tested all of the big players (and many others) to find the best tablets worth your money right now.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-table-of-contents\">Table of contents</h2> \n<ul> \n <li><p><a href=\"#jump-link-best-tablets-for-2025\">Best tablets for 2025</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"#jump-link-important-things-to-consider-before-buying-a-tablet\">Important things to consider before buying a tablet</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"#jump-link-how-we-test-tablets\">How we test tablets</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"#jump-link-other-tablets-we-tested\">Other tablets we tested</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"#jump-link-tablet-faqs\">Tablet FAQs</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"#jump-link-tablet-accessories\">Tablet accessories</a></p></li> \n</ul> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-best-tablets-for-2025\">Best tablets for 2025</h2> \n<p> </p> \n<p> </p> \n<p> </p> \n<p> </p> \n<p> </p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-important-things-to-consider-before-buying-a-tablet\">Important things to consider before buying a tablet</h2> \n<p>Before you start looking at specific devices, the number one thing you should do is figure out what you plan to use your new tablet for. That’s because if all you need is something to keep a kid busy, buying a brand new Apple iPad Air or iPad Pro doesn’t make a ton of sense. On the flip side, if you want to use a tablet for video editing or drawing, you’ll need to take things like performance, versatility and stylus support more seriously — especially if you're considering using it as a laptop replacement.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span> \n<p>You’ll also want to think about stuff like how often you plan on traveling with the device and if it’s more for productivity, or for less demanding stuff like web browsing or streaming shows. There’s also an important trade-off to consider when it comes to battery life as well. Larger devices tend to have longer runtimes, though an increase in size may make it less portable.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-how-we-test-tablets\">How we test tablets</h2> \n<p>When evaluating different tablets, there are a few important things we look for above all else: solid performance, a good screen and long battery life. For performance, we run a handful of synthetic tests like Geekbench 6, while also performing a number of hands-on, real-world use cases such as editing photos and playing games. And with tablets often serving as hybrid devices, we also consider how easy it is to multitask and switch quickly between various apps. The more responsive a device feels, the better.</p> \n<p>Because a tablet’s display is such a critical component, we also view a wide range of content to gauge things like brightness, color gamut and dynamic range. It’s important to take into account the difference between various panel types like OLED, which typically produce richer colors and excellent contrast but may not be as bright as a mini LED display. Recently, refresh rate has become an increasingly important spec as 90Hz and 120Hz screens can make scrolling smoother and graphics appear sharper in games.</p> \n<p>We also consider a tablet’s design (including things like size, weight and water resistance), its connectivity (WiFi, Bluetooth, NFC, 5G, et cetera) and special features like stylus support or the ability to serve as a secondary display. That’s because, while tablets were often viewed as content consumption devices in the past, higher-end devices like the Surface Pro and iPad Pro are more than capable of <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/the-best-2-in-1-laptops-for-2023-155052641.html\">replacing a laptop</a> for a lot of people.</p> \n<p>Finally, we test battery life by running our standard local video rundown test, which involves playing a single video on a loop from 100 percent until it runs out of juice. Ideally, a tablet should be able to last an entire working day, but longer runtimes are always welcome — especially for users relying on them for productivity, entertainment and storage options on the go.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-other-tablets-we-tested\">Other tablets we tested</h2> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-apple-ipad-mini\">Apple iPad mini</h3> \n<p>Apple updated the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/ipad-mini-7-review-safe-boring-and-everything-i-want-in-a-small-tablet-130039378.html\">iPad mini</a> for 2024 with some under-the-hood changes including a new processor and additional RAM to help support Apple Intelligence features. While the iPad mini is one of the best iPads you can buy, its small size makes it a bit niche. Only if you prefer your tablet be the size of an ereader should you consider this one.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-google-pixel-tablet\">Google Pixel Tablet</h3> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-tablet-review-clever-accessories-transform-an-unexciting-tablet-070147119.html\">Google Pixel Tablet</a> excels as a smart display rather than a simple tablet. As the latter, it's unexciting, but when paired with its speaker/charging dock, it becomes much more useful. It could be a good option for those that already live within the Google ecosystem and use the Google Assistant often, or those who like the idea of a tablet that can be docked and used as a smart display as well.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-oneplus-pad\">OnePlus Pad</h3> \n<p>The solid <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/oneplus-pad-review-solid-hardware-thats-let-down-by-android-130039695.html\">OnePlus Pad</a> is let down by Android because there aren't many Android apps designed to be used on a large display like this model's 11.6-inch panel. Otherwise, the hardware is well-designed, its companion stylus is comfortable to use and it has an excellent battery life.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-tablet-faqs\">Tablet FAQs</h2> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-what-is-the-best-brand-for-tablets\">What is the best brand for tablets?</h3> \n<p>The best brand for tablets is really the brand you feel most comfortable with. We recommend taking stock of the gadgets you already have — do you live in the Apple ecosystem already? An iPad might be best for you then. Do you have a Samsung phone? If so, a Galaxy Tab will likely be the most convenient choice. There is no one \"best brand\" for tablets; you’ll find good options made by companies including Apple, Google, Samsung, Microsoft and Amazon.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-can-a-tablet-replace-a-laptop\">Can a tablet replace a laptop?</h3> \n<p>It’s possible for a tablet to replace a laptop, but you’ll need a few accessories to truly make the experience as close as possible to that of a traditional notebook. A keyboard is a must, be it a keyboard case or a Bluetooth accessory that you keep with you. Some keyboard cases, like apple’s Magic Keyboard for the iPad, have a built-in trackpad, which will be more ergonomic than tapping on your tablet’s screen for input. Additionally, you could go one step further and use a wireless mouse that connects via Bluetooth to your tablet. If you’re primarily looking for a tablet to replace your laptop, consider buying a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/the-best-2-in-1-laptops-for-2023-155052641.html\">2-in-1 laptop</a> since those systems typically consist of high-powered tablets that are designed to work well with (and without) keyboards.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-what-size-screen-do-i-need\">What size screen do I need?</h3> \n<p>Figuring out the best screen size for you will also be related to the kind of work (or play) you intend to do. Larger screens make it much easier to view two apps side by side, and big screens also deliver a more immersive movie viewing experience — especially when paired with an OLED display or Liquid Retina display. But at the same time, the larger the tablet, the less likely you’re going to want to move it around. That means you’re not only going to want to take stock of your workspace (i.e., if you have a desk or instead plan to work from a couch or even your bed), but you’re also going to want to think about how the device will fit into your everyday routine or commute (if you have one).</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-tablet-accessories\">Tablet accessories</h2> \n<p>Finally, you’ll want to consider any add-ons or accessories you’re planning to use, which can range from detachable keyboards to things like external mics or a stylus. The good news is that many of the best tablets nowadays offer some kind of keyboard accessory, which allows the device to function more like a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-2-in-1-laptops-173038508.html\">2-in-1</a> instead of simply being a content consumption device. Some tablets also feature things like microSD card slots that support expandable storage, or optional 4G or 5G connectivity, which can be a real boon to frequent travelers. And if you’re planning to use the tablet mainly for work, you might want to grab a USB hub for connecting all your favorite peripherals so your devices don’t have to fight for the charger.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-recent-updates\">Recent updates</h2> \n<p><strong>July 2025:</strong> Updated to ensure our top picks and buying advice remain accurate.</p> \n<p><strong>May 2025:</strong> Updated to ensure our top picks and buying advice remain accurate.</p> \n<p><strong>March 2025:</strong> Updated to include the latest base iPad in our top picks,</p> \n<p><strong>February 2025:</strong> Updated to include clarification around our top picks and new buying advice.</p> \n<p><strong>October 2024:</strong> We updated this list to include information on the new iPad mini 7.</p> \n<p><strong>June 2024:</strong> We updated our top picks to include the Microsoft Surface Pro Copilot+ edition.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/best-tablets-150026056.html?src=rss"}

Until then, you can <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/how-to-install-the-ios-26-public-beta-171117199.html\">download and install</a> the newly released public beta 2 (or <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ios-ipados-release-notes/ios-ipados-26-release-notes\">iOS 26 developer beta 6</a> for developers). During Apple's recent earnings call, CEO Tim Cook said its collection of upcoming beta operating systems (including iOS) are \"by far the most popular developer betas we’ve had,\" <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2025/08/01/tim-cook-ios-26-is-by-far-apples-most-popular-beta-ever/\"><em>9to5Mac </em>reports</a>. You can also take a look at our <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ios-26-beta-preview-liquid-glass-is-better-than-you-think-172155402.html\">preview of the iOS 26 public beta release</a>, which shows off the fresh home and lock screen redesign. Called <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apples-new-liquid-glass-design-is-its-biggest-visual-update-in-years-172158766.html\">Liquid Glass</a>, the new translucent look will extend across all of Apple's upcoming operating systems. The overhaul is one of several big changes coming to iOS, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/macos-26-beta-preview-spotlights-time-to-shine-171700779.html\">macOS</a>, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/ipados-26-preview-a-long-awaited-multi-tasking-update-pays-off-so-far-172522054.html\">iPadOS</a> and the rest of Apple's software suite, all of which were showcased during the company's <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/wwdc-2025-everything-apple-announced-including-ios-26-liquid-glass-design-and-more-171718030.html\">WWDC keynote</a> on June 9.</p>\n<p>After overpromising on AI plans last year, Apple kept its iOS roadmap focused more on basic quality of life improvements this year. There are multiple useful additions coming to the Phone and Messages apps on your iPhone, for instance: Apple execs outlined the ability to weed out spam texts or other unknown senders and an option to hold your spot on a phone call when you've been waiting for a representative to pick up. Plus, a treasured feature that we took for granted is coming back (hint: it's in the Photos app).</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Siri, meanwhile, is in a holding pattern. Apple has previously specified that its smarter voice assistant — first promised at WWDC 2024 — is delayed until some point \"<a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/apple-is-delaying-its-smarter-more-personal-siri-183513424.html\">in the coming year</a>,\" so you shouldn't expect any major changes in the current betas. But there are reports that Apple is aiming to give Siri a bigger brain transplant by <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/30/apple-chatgpt-claude-siri/\">basing it on third-party artificial intelligence models</a> like OpenAI's ChatGPT or Anthropic's Claude, which could make 2026 a pivotal year. The company is also reportedly working on a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/apple-reportedly-has-a-stripped-down-ai-chatbot-to-compete-with-chatgpt-in-the-works-164345473.html\">'stripped-down' AI chatbot</a> to rival ChatGPT.</p>\n<p>With each beta, it seems like additional new improvements are popping up, like this <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/apples-rumored-live-translation-feature-for-airpods-could-be-coming-with-ios-26-152715034.html\">new AirPods gesture</a> we're all curious about, and this FaceTime feature that'll <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/ios-26-can-freeze-your-facetime-video-if-it-detects-nudity-135329941.html\">freeze your video if it detects nudity</a>. With the release of the <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ios-ipados-release-notes/ios-ipados-26-release-notes\">iOS 26 developer beta 5</a>, we saw more added features, like a new bouncy animation on the passcode screen and in the Control Center, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/05/ios-26-beta-5-features/\"><em>MacRumors </em>reports</a>. Some or all of those changes will likely soon migrate into the separate public beta (see below). Most newer iPhone models are <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/apple-is-releasing-ios-26-this-fall-heres-the-full-list-of-compatible-iphones-191854795.html\">eligible to download iOS 26 </a>(both the betas and final version). Want to see the full list of new features coming this fall? Read on.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-what-is-ios-26\">What is iOS 26?</h2>\n<p>The current iPhone operating system is iOS 18, and Apple is still actively updating it — <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-18-6-features/\">version 18.6</a> was just recently released. But don't expect to see iOS 19. Instead, Apple is skipping the numbering ahead to iOS 26 later this year. The company has decided to line up its iOS version numbers with a year-based system, similar to car model years. So while iOS and its sibling operating systems will be released in late 2025, they're all designated \"26\" to reflect the year ahead.&nbsp;</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"a list of the new OSes\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-06/29bbb6f0-4555-11f0-b2de-ada42a83075d\" style=\"height: 1080px; width: 1920px;\" /><figcaption>It's official, we're moving to iOS 26. (Apple)</figcaption></figure>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-what-is-liquid-glass-design\">What is Liquid Glass design?</h2>\n<p>Let's be honest. Out of everything announced at WWDC this year, the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apples-new-liquid-glass-design-is-its-biggest-visual-update-in-years-172158766.html\">new Liquid Glass design</a> was the star of the show. The iPhone's home and lock screens have looked pretty much the same year after year — the last exciting thing (in my opinion) was the option to add your own aesthetic to your home screen by customizing your apps and widgets. So seeing the home and lock screens' new facelift is refreshing.</p>\n<p>So what exactly is Liquid Glass? Apple calls it a \"<a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=4130e2f0-a14f-4c5e-bdab-cd52ac7d8e79&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=86b7b54f-7ccd-4fbb-a927-09c327b93cbc&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Apple&amp;linkText=new+translucent+material&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hcHBsZS5jb20vbmV3c3Jvb20vMjAyNS8wNi9hcHBsZS1lbGV2YXRlcy10aGUtaXBob25lLWV4cGVyaWVuY2Utd2l0aC1pb3MtMjYvIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI4NmI3YjU0Zi03Y2NkLTRmYmItYTkyNy0wOWMzMjdiOTNjYmMiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFwcGxlLmNvbS9uZXdzcm9vbS8yMDI1LzA2L2FwcGxlLWVsZXZhdGVzLXRoZS1pcGhvbmUtZXhwZXJpZW5jZS13aXRoLWlvcy0yNi8ifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAVivyXXsD7DiKwA3X-v-YLSp-mKPz8KpUrb1ctVS4Hji&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2025%2F06%2Fapple-elevates-the-iphone-experience-with-ios-26%2F\">new translucent material</a>\" since, well, the apps and widgets are clear. However, the screen can still adapt to dark and light modes, depending on surroundings. You'll also notice buttons with a new floating design in several apps, like Phone and Maps. They're designed to be less distracting than the current buttons, but are still easy to see. While the design overhaul has proven to be controversial since its announcement, some — including Engadget's own Devindra Hardawar — like the new direction, even if it's somewhat reminiscent of <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/apples-liquid-glass-is-windows-vista-done-well-181954910.html\">Microsoft's translucent Windows Vista Aero designs</a> from nearly twenty years ago.</p>\n<p>That said, as of the release of the iOS 26 beta 2, Apple <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/apple-read-your-mean-tweets-about-liquid-glass-and-finder-222230726.html\">has already incorporated some user feedback</a> into the design, dialing back the transparency in at least some places. And while it will continue to evolve, Apple users won't be able to escape it: Liquid Glass was designed to make all of Apple's OSes more cohesive. Here's a look at how the translucent aesthetic will look with <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/macos-tahoe-26-will-bring-apples-new-liquid-glass-ui-to-your-desktop-174149070.html\">the new macOS Tahoe 26</a> on your desktop.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-what-are-the-new-and-notable-features-of-ios-26\">What are the new and notable features of iOS 26?</h2>\n<p>iOS 26 has a laundry list of new features. Among the most worthwhile:</p>\n<p><strong>Phone app redesign:</strong> You'll finally be able to scroll through contacts, recent calls and voicemail messages all on one screen. It also comes with a new feature called Hold Assist that'll notify you when an agent comes to the phone so you can avoid the elevator music and continue on with other tasks.</p>\n<p><strong>Live Translation in Phone, FaceTime and Messages:</strong> iOS 26 is bringing the ability to have a conversation via phone call or text message with someone who speaks another language. Live Translation will translate your conversation in real time, which results in some stop-and-go interactions in the examples Apple shared during its presentation.</p>\n<p><strong>Polls in group chats:</strong> Tired of sorting through what seems like hundreds of messages in your group chat? You and your friends will soon be able to create polls in group messages for deciding things like which brunch spot you're eating at or whose car you're taking on a road trip.</p>\n<p><strong>Filtering unknown senders in Messages:</strong> If you haven't received spam texts about unpaid tolls or other citations, you're lucky. For those of us who have, those annoying messages will soon be filtered away in a separate folder.</p>\n<p><strong>Visual Intelligence:</strong> Similar to a reverse Google image search, this new feature will allow you to search for anything that's on your iPhone screen. For instance, if you spot a pair of shoes someone is wearing in an Instagram photo, you can <a href=\"https://tech.yahoo.com/phones/article/how-to-take-a-screenshot-on-your-iphone-133139822.html\">screenshot it and use Visual Intelligence</a> to find those shoes (or similar ones) online.</p>\n<p><strong>Photos tabs are back:</strong> For anyone who's still frustrated with the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/how-apple-redesigned-its-photos-app-around-customization-120038901.html\">Photos changes made last year</a>, you'll be happy to know that your tabs are coming back. Library and Collections will have their own separate spaces so you don't have to scroll to infinity to find what you're looking for.</p>\n<p><strong>FaceTime \"Communication Safety\" feature: </strong>A newer addition to iOS 26 appears to be the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/ios-26-can-freeze-your-facetime-video-if-it-detects-nudity-135329941.html\">FaceTime \"Communication Safety\" feature</a> that pauses communications if and when nudity is detected. The feature appears to be a child safety feature that uses on-device detection, thus obviating any cloud-based privacy issues.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://tech.yahoo.com/phones/article/how-to-customize-your-iphones-lock-screen-on-ios-26-110535863.html\"><strong>New lock screen options</strong></a><strong>: </strong>The iPhone lock screen gets more customizable in iOS 26, with a cooler clock, 3D wallpaper effects, more widgets and better focus mode options.&nbsp;</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"New Hold Assist being displayed at the wwdc keynote\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-06/a506ddc0-4556-11f0-9d7a-9a93e6a181c1\" style=\"height: 1080px; width: 1920px;\" /><figcaption>Apple's Hold Assist will be nifty for those pesky services that put you on hold for 10 or more minutes.

Here's what's coming this fall.</p>\n<p><strong>Multitasking and real windowing:</strong> When you download the newest update, you'll be able to have multiple apps running on your screen at the same time. Once you open an app, it'll appear on your screen as normal but you'll be able to resize and move it across your screen to make room for other apps. This feature is optional so you can turn it off if you don't like it.</p>\n<p><strong>Visual update:</strong> Along with the other new OSes, iPadOS 26 is coming with the Liquid Glass aesthetic. This new look will appear on the lock and home screens, as well as the drop-down menus.</p>\n<p><strong>New menu bar:</strong> When you swipe down on your screen, the new menu bar will appear with options like File, Edit, Windows and more. There's also a search option if you're looking for something specific.</p>\n<p>Check out our <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/ipados-26-preview-a-long-awaited-multi-tasking-update-pays-off-so-far-172522054.html\">first impressions of iPadOS 26</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-what-about-airpods\">What about AirPods?</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/ios-26-updates-for-airpods-preview-enhanced-audio-recording-camera-remote-and-more-173036046.html\">AirPods are also getting updated</a> with iOS 26. Here are some of the more notable functions.</p>\n<p><strong>Enhanced audio recording:</strong> Apple calls this \"studio-quality\" audio recording, and with it, you'll notice more clarity while in noisy environments.</p>\n<p><strong>Camera remote control:</strong> Using this, you can take a photo or start and stop video recording with just one press on your AirPods. When taking photos, you'll get a three-second countdown before your iPhone or iPad snaps the picture.</p>\n<p><strong>Live translation feature:</strong> While not officially announced or confirmed, it appears that the long-rumored live translation for AirPods <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/apples-rumored-live-translation-feature-for-airpods-could-be-coming-with-ios-26-152715034.html\">could be coming with iOS 26</a>. The evidence comes from a system asset spotted in the in iOS 26 beta showing a gesture that's triggered by pressing both earbud stems at the same time. The photo also shows words in several different languages.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-which-iphones-will-be-able-to-upgrade-to-ios-26\">Which iPhones will be able to upgrade to iOS 26?</h2>\n<p>A few iPhone models that run the current version of iOS — iPhone XR, XS and XS Max — won't be compatible with the latest upgrade.

The new models will come equipped with the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/ios-26-public-beta-is-available-to-download-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-new-iphone-and-ipad-update-135749331.html?feature=disableNCPValidation\">latest iOS 26 features</a> preinstalled, along with whatever additional features Apple reveals at the launch event. But since we still have to wait a few weeks (presumably) until the iPhone event, we can at least speculate what the new phones will look like. As with most unreleased iPhone models, rumors and leaks have trickled in about the hardware side ahead of the official introduction. Here's what we're expecting and what we can reasonably assume we'll get from Cupertino in September.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-how-much-will-the-iphone-17-cost\">How much will the iPhone 17 cost?</h2>\n<p>Apple's <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/apple-to-invest-another-100-billion-into-the-us-to-avoid-tariffs-210250020.html\">announced plan to expand US-based manufacturing partners</a> seems to give it at least some shielding from the steepest Trump administration tariffs that have already triggered price increases on everything from <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/the-original-nintendo-switch-is-about-to-get-more-expensive-in-the-us-170646701.html\">Switch consoles</a> to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cameras/nikon-joins-other-camera-manufacturers-in-raising-prices-due-to-tariffs-120011854.html\">high-end cameras</a> to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/sonos-is-raising-prices-this-year-to-make-up-for-tariff-expenses-123031336.html\">Sonos speakers</a>. But given that President Trump's trade policies can change from week to week, and Apple's continuing reliance on Asia-based supply chains, price shocks remain an ongoing possibility. The bigger question is: Will Apple absorb any higher costs, or pass them on to consumers?&nbsp;</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>If prices do creep up, Apple may choose to pair it with an &quot;upgrade.&quot; Consider this recent rumor <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/06/will-iphone-17-pro-start-at-256gb-storage/\">posted by <em>MacRumors</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>from a leaker known as &quot;<a href=\"https://weibo.com/u/5143897135\">Instant Digital</a>,&quot; suggesting that the default storage of the iPhone 17 line may start at 256GB, doubling the current 128GB baseline. While that could be accompanied by a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/30/iphone-17-price-increase-expected/\">price increase of $50</a>, Apple could at least pitch it as a &quot;better value.&quot; That said, the company <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/every-macbook-air-now-starts-with-16gb-of-ram-at-no-extra-cost-150041320.html\">doubled the default RAM of its Mac computers</a> from 8GB to 16GB at no extra cost in 2024 — but that was before the current Trump tariff cycle started.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-when-will-the-iphone-17s-be-announced\">When will the iPhone 17 series be announced?</h2>\n<p>Most years, the flagship smartphones are introduced in September. <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/05/apple-iphone-17-event-set-september-9/\"><em>MacRumors </em>highlighted</a> a story originally reported by <a href=\"https://www.iphone-ticker.de/iphone-17-vorstellung-wohl-am-9-verkaufsstart-am-19-september-261445/\">iphone-ticker.de</a> that the Apple iPhone 17 event could be Tuesday, September 9, according to information gleaned from German mobile phone providers.</p>\n<p>It's still too early to have the specific dates; some years, Apple only gives a week or two of lead time between sending invites and hosting the event. But years of past precedent show that sometime in September should be when the 17 models make their debut. This family of smartphones may be the last to follow that trend, however. There have been hints that the introduction of the iPhone 18 collection in 2026 will be <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apple-reportedly-wants-to-split-up-the-iphones-release-schedule-164737099.html\">split</a> into a pro-tier announcement in the fall and a standard model announcement the following spring.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-what-will-the-new-iphone-17-lineup-include\">What will the new iPhone 17 lineup include?</h2>\n<p>Design leaks suggest that Apple is building an <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-is-said-to-be-working-on-a-significantly-thinner-iphone-180823565.html\">ultra-thin smartphone</a>, likely to be named the iPhone 17 Air to match Apple's ultralight laptop designation. <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman, often a solid source of advanced intel about Apple, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/this-year-could-bring-the-iphone-air-and-an-entry-level-ipad-with-apple-intelligence-175059162.html\">reported</a> in January that the iPhone 17 Air will be equipped with a basic A19 chip and will only have a single camera lens. It may also use Apple's new in-house modem, which was introduced in February on the <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-16e-review-whats-your-acceptable-compromise-020016288.html\">iPhone 16e</a>. More details about this development may leak ahead of September, but that's what we know for now.</p>\n<p>An investor note from Apple analyst Jeff Pu <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/15/iphone-17-air-titanium-rumor/\">indicated</a> that the Air will have a titanium frame. If his reports are accurate, the lightweight smartphone will be the only entry in the iPhone 17 lineup to use that metal; the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max are expected to be made of aluminum, which is oddly a lighter material than titanium. Other speculation had suggested that the Air would use a blend of aluminum and titanium, so the exact materials may not be known until the official announcement.</p>\n<p>Additionally, an August 4 <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/04/iphone-17-air-battery-half-thickness-17-pro/\"><em>MacRumors </em>report</a> says the internal battery pack of the iPhone Air is just 2.49mm thick — half the thickness of the iPhone 17 Pro battery. The leak was posted on the <a href=\"https://m.blog.naver.com/PostView.naver?blogId=yeux1122&amp;logNo=223958615195&amp;navType=by\">Korean-language Naver blog</a>, where they show the alleged batteries of the iPhone 17 Air and 17 Pro side by side. The same account claimed the 17 Air's battery capacity was a mere 2,800 mAh, <em>MacRumors</em> notes. (That's below the battery capacity of current iPhone 16 models.)</p>\n<p>A recent rumor from Majin Bu, whom <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/11/iphone-17-pro-antenna-rumor/\"><em>MacRumors </em></a>classifies as a &quot;hit-or-miss leaker,&quot; suggests the iPhone 17 Pro will have better wireless signal strength thanks to an updated antenna design. The individual <a href=\"https://x.com/MajinBuOfficial/status/1954890746693312762\">posted a render on X</a> that shows a new antenna system that wraps around the iPhone 17 Pro's supposedly wider rear camera bump. Again, this is a render, not a real-world photo. That said, we can't knock the goal of better wireless reception, so we're hoping this one has a degree of truth to it.</p>\n<p>Each new roster includes a base model, but over the years, Apple has shaken up the variety of phones it offers. Most likely there will be an iPhone 17 and an iPhone 17 Pro. Apple has also committed to the size matters philosophy, and has been building an iPhone Pro Max option with an even bigger screen and better battery life; the 17 roster will almost certainly have one as well.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The new Pro iPhones are said to have a full-width &quot;camera island&quot; on the rear, which would mark the first time an Apple model opted for that design. This feature can be seen in the <a href=\"https://x.com/Skyfops/status/1949936265232888057\">purported iPhone 17 &quot;spotted in the wild.&quot;</a> The pics, highlighted on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/28/iphone-17-pro-possibly-spotted-in-the-wild/\"><em>MacRumors</em></a>, show a black cased iPhone (17 Pro?) with the distinct back panel. Is it the real deal? The dual angles lend a degree of credibility in a social media landscape increasingly polluted with AI-enhanced fakes, but your guess is as good as ours.</p>\n<div id=\"a462ba8164d54c5a8ac8626b1540fe2f\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">I just spotted a test development iPhone in the wild 🤩🤩🤩 <a href=\"https://t.co/iS3PtKWqxJ\">pic.twitter.com/iS3PtKWqxJ</a></p>— Fox Pupy 🦊🧡 (@Skyfops) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Skyfops/status/1949936265232888057?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 28, 2025</a></blockquote>\n \n\n</div>\n<p>The iPhone 17 Air seems primed to take the place of a potential iPhone 17 Plus. Since the iPhone 16e was only just introduced in February at <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/a-599-iphone-16e-is-a-cruel-joke-200507275.html\">a surprisingly high price point</a>, it seems unlikely that there will be a new addition to that lower end of the spectrum, the models that were previously called SE.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>At the very least, it sounds like the iPhone 17 Air won't take away the charging port and rely only on wireless connectivity. <em>Bloomberg</em> said that while Apple had investigated making the iPhone 17 Air without a single port, the company (fortunately) changed plans. He also says that the rumored phone will have a 6.6-inch screen and include the Dynamic Island and Camera Control button. Finally, the price is rumored at $900 — likely more than the standard iPhone 17 but less than the Pro.</p>\n<p>We've also gotten what seems to be a reliable look at what the color lineup will be for the new smartphones. <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2849423/iphone-17-colors-confirmed-see-all-of-apples-2026-options-right-here.html\"><em>Macworld</em></a> reported that the iPhone 17 will be available in black, white, steel gray, green, purple and light blue. The iPhone 17 Air will reportedly have four color options: black, white, light blue and light gold. While the Air colors will be less saturated, the visuals for the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max will go bold. The options for the Pro models are expected to be black, white, gray, dark blue and orange.</p>\n<p>On July 30, <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/phones/iphones/iphone-17-dummies-just-leaked-in-all-colors-and-theres-a-bold-new-signature-hue\"><em>Tom's Guide</em></a> highlighted an X post from <a href=\"https://x.com/SonnyDickson/status/1950325609957380405\">Sonny Dickson</a> — a longtime and generally reliable leaker of unreleased iPhone information — showing &quot;dummy&quot; iPhone 17 models in the new colors that were the source of the aforementioned <em>Macworld</em> story. While these are literally just mock-ups — not real, leaked iPhones — it's interesting to see how the design and color rumors translate into a real-world look and feel.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-what-will-the-new-ios-be-like\">What will iOS 26 be like?</h2>\n<p>Apple upended its numbering conventions with WWDC 2025, and will match the name of each new operating system to the year it's released. So when the next wave of iPhones hits, they'll be running on <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/apple-ios-26-public-beta-is-live-heres-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-new-iphone-features-and-how-to-use-them-135749325.html\">iOS 26</a>.</p>\n<p>On the design side, the smartphone OS introduced during the big developer showcase took a contentious approach dubbed Liquid Glass. Apple has been <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/apple-read-your-mean-tweets-about-liquid-glass-and-finder-222230726.html\">scaling down</a> the amount of transparency effects in the subsequent beta tests of iOS 26, but it will still have a glass-like visual.</p>\n<p>The feature list includes big and small updates. On the more impactful side, the Phone and Photos apps have been redesigned. There will be several features leveraging artificial intelligence, such as live translation capabilities coming to Phone, FaceTime and Messages. Apple is also currently testing a sensitive content warning for child accounts that will <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/ios-26-can-freeze-your-facetime-video-if-it-detects-nudity-135329941.html\">freeze FaceTime video</a> if nudity is detected by on-device machine learning tools. And the company is also launching Visual Intelligence, which will use AI to search for elements in an image.</p>\n<p>iOS 26 also has a litany of minor, quality of life improvements. Group texts are getting support for polls. And for the slow risers out there, iOS 26 will finally let you escape the tyranny of the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apple-will-at-long-last-let-you-customize-snooze-times-on-alarms-in-ios-26-190001600.html\">nine minute snooze alarm</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The next iOS is now available as a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/how-to-install-the-ios-18-public-beta-202938588.html\">public beta</a>. Here are our initial impressions of the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/ios-26-beta-preview-liquid-glass-is-better-than-you-think-172155402.html\">Liquid Glass design</a> and other new features. <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/apple-released-ios-26-public-beta-heres-the-list-of-compatible-iphones-that-can-download-it-today-191854620.html\">iOS 26 is compatible</a> with all models back through iPhone 11.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-what-other-products-are-expected-to-be-released-alongside-the-iphone-17\">What other products are expected to be released alongside the iPhone 17?</h2>\n<p>If Apple follows its usual pattern, the iPhone 17 will be announced alongside new Apple Watch products. That would be the Apple Watch Series 11 (if Apple sticks to the same naming scheme), and maybe an Apple Watch Ultra 3 and/or an updated Apple Watch SE. (They'll all run <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/wearables/watchos-26-preview-its-the-little-things-140035949.html\">watchOS 26</a>, of course.)</p>\n<p>Other possibilities — and this is, again, speculation — could include refreshed Apple AirPods Pro (which received its <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/airpods-pro-review-second-generation-130048218-130048292.html\">last big update in 2022</a>) and maybe new <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/wearables/apples-next-airtag-is-coming-in-2025-with-privacy-improvements-173028439.html\">AirTags trackers</a> (first released in 2021).</p>\n<p>But knowing Apple doesn't like to take the spotlight off its star performer — the iPhone — those accessories could come sometime later in the year (if they appear this year at all). The same goes for rumored refreshes of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/13/new-apple-tv-coming-later-this-year-with-a17-pro-chip/\">Apple TV</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/13/homepod-mini-new-chip/\">HomePod mini</a>, which are also getting long in the tooth.</p>\n<p>Don't expect any Macs or iPads, however. Apple has recently been holding computer updates for late October (as it did last year with the new <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/everything-apple-announced-during-its-unofficial-mac-week-210115997.html\">M4 Macs</a>).</p>\n<p><strong>Update, August, 13, 2025, 10:02PM ET:</strong> Added a list of the products that are expected to be released alongside the iPhone 17s.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Update, August 11, 2025, 7:27PM ET:</strong> Added a render of a rumored new antenna design for the iPhone 17 Pro.</p>\n<p><strong>Update, August 8, 2025, 4:43PM ET:</strong> Added new speculation and reports about iPhone 17 pricing.</p>\n<p><strong>Update, August 6, 2025, 4:05PM ET:</strong> Added latest details about the potential iPhone 17 event date.</p>\n<p><strong>Update, August 4, 2025, 5:23PM ET:</strong> Added latest battery leaks about the iPhone 17 models.</p>\n<p><strong>Update, August 1, 2025, 8:15AM ET:</strong> Added new photos showing potential iPhone 17 colors.</p>\n<p><strong>Update, July 30, 2025, 11:08AM ET:</strong> Added latest leaks and rumors about the iPhone 17, and updated information on the iOS 26 public beta.</p>\n<p><strong>Update, July 17, 2025, 4:40PM ET:</strong> Added latest information about iOS 26, possible materials for the Air, and the color options for the different models.</p>\n<p><strong>Update, March 17, 2025, 2PM ET:</strong> Added details about the rumored price and features of the iPhone 17 Air.</p>\n<p><strong>Update, April 11, 2025, 3:45PM ET: </strong>Added details from Front Page Tech's new video that claims to reveal details from a leaked iOS 19 build.</p>\n<p><em>Katie Teague contributed to this story.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-17-release-is-rumored-for-september-everything-you-need-to-know-ahead-of-the-apple-fall-event-153024317.html?src=rss"}

You'll also notice buttons with a new floating design. Liquid Glass was designed to make all of Apple's OSes more cohesive.</p>\n<p><strong>Phone app redesign:</strong> You'll finally be able to scroll through contacts, recent calls and voicemail messages all on one screen. It also comes with a new feature called Hold Assist that'll notify you when an agent comes to the phone so you can avoid the elevator music.</p>\n<p><strong>Live Translate:</strong> iOS 26 is bringing the ability to have a conversation via phone call or text message with someone who speaks another language. Live Translate will translate your conversation in real time.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Polls feature:</strong> Coming to group messages in the Messages app, chat members will be able to create polls. This can help prevent the unwanted 30+ messages when it comes to deciding which restaurant you're meeting at this weekend.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/ready-for-apples-ios-26-these-are-all-the-compatible-iphones-that-can-run-public-beta-2-right-now-191854071.html?src=rss"}

Sources reportedly told the publication that Apple has a slate of new smart home products in the works that could help pivot its lagging AI strategy.</p>\n<p>The center of the new lineup is a tabletop AI companion that has been described as an iPad on a movable robotic arm. It would be able to swivel to face the screen toward a user as they move around their home or office. Sources said the current prototype uses a horizontal display that's about seven inches while the motorized arm can move the screen about six inches away from the base in any direction. Equipped with a <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/an-updated-siri-that-interacts-with-apps-reportedly-wont-be-here-until-next-spring-183000378.html\"><ins>long-promised overhaul</ins></a> to the Siri voice assistant, this device could act like an additional person, recalling information, making suggestions and participating in conversations. According to <em>Bloomberg</em>, Apple is targeting a 2027 release for this product.&nbsp;</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Apple's new lineup is also rumored to include a smart home hub that is a simpler version of the robotic friend with no moving stand. We might be seeing this sooner, with a projected 2026 release for the device. This hub device would be able to control music playback, take notes, browse the web and host videoconferencing. Both the robot companion and the smart home hub are reportedly running a new operating system called Charismatic that's designed to support multiple users. The Siri running on the device will be given a particularly cheery personality, and it may also be getting a visual representation. <em>Bloomberg</em>'s sources said there hasn't been a final decision on aesthetics; internal tests have had Siri looking like an animated Finder icon and like a Memoji.</p>\n<p>Today's scuttlebutt follows on previous reports from Gurman that pointed to Apple's interest in these categories. The idea of a smart home hub was apparently floated at the company as far back as 2022, and it's finally being <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/apples-smart-home-hub-could-reportedly-make-its-debut-later-this-year-161702487.html\"><ins>rumored</ins></a> to have a formal debut some time this year.

While this <em>Bloomberg</em> piece offers more detail about those hypothetical plans, there's always a chance Apple will change direction or scrap a project.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/apples-tabletop-robot-companion-rumored-for-2027-launch-204904807.html?src=rss"}

Chibi-Robo’s helpfulness isn’t limited to humans, though. In its quest to spread happiness, it also assists several animals and even enchanted toys along the way. As a player, you have to keep an eye on the robot’s battery life and use power outlets dotted around the house to recharge it. Fail to do so and it’ll collapse, and you’ll lose a chunk of the in-game currency you’ve collected.</p>\n<p><em>Chibi-Robo! </em>looks like a typically charming Nintendo game in every respect, but it was actually originally conceived by now-defunct developer Skip Ltd. as a point-and-click adventure game, with Bandai as the publisher. Exactly how or why the game ended up moving over to Nintendo remains a mystery, but director Kenichi Nishi told <a href=\"https://www.timeextension.com/features/the-making-of-chibi-robo-how-miyamoto-saved-a-cult-hit-from-the-scrapheap\"><em>Time Extension</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>that<em>&nbsp;</em>Shigeru Miyamoto took a particular liking to the character design. The legendary Mario creator then went on to play something of an overseer role in the game’s development under its new publisher.</p>\n<p><em>Chibi-Robo! </em>spawned a number of handheld spinoffs, but the original game remains the one with cult classic status. It’s also become increasingly hard to play over the years, with Nintendo choosing not to port the game forward.

There's no reason to go with Norton as your VPN unless you're getting it as part of another Norton 360 bundle.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">For this review, I ran rigorous tests that highlighted Norton VPN's strengths (well-designed user interfaces, a verified privacy policy) along with its weaknesses (holes in its security, renewals that double the price, weak customer support). Norton's history of focusing on Windows means that app is by far the most complete; if you're on any other platform, expect to miss out on the best VPN protocols and the complete feature set.</p> \n<p><em>Editors' note: We're in the process of rebooting all of our VPN reviews from scratch.

Its apps for Windows, Mac, Android, iOS and browsers are all similar, but there are distinctions in both design and features.</p> \n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"jump-link-windows\" style=\"margin-top: 16pt; margin-bottom: 4pt;\">Windows</h3> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">Once you download the Norton VPN app from its website or the Microsoft Store, an installation wizard takes over and makes the rest of the process easy. You'll have to click to grant a few permissions and skip through a tutorial, but after that, you're free to move about the interface.</p> \n<figure> \n <img alt=\"windows app norton vpn\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-08/91d66b31-748b-11f0-9e7f-c069cac1ac32\" style=\"height: 3000px; width: 4000px;\" /> \n <figcaption></figcaption> \n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n </div> \n</figure> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">Norton VPN's Windows UI was a pleasant surprise. There's no wasted detail on the front page. Click the large yellow button to connect to the VPN, or select the server name to go to the location list, which is alphabetized. Clicking the very first entry in the list connects you to the fastest location. IP rotator servers and double VPN routes are grouped under tabs below that. There's no clutter and no aggressive popups, and connections happen quickly.</p> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">You'll find four tabs on the left-hand side of the Window. The top one manages the VPN. Then there's a store for other Norton products (IMO the only real misstep), a set of help pages and the controls for the VPN's settings and features. This last is subdivided into a row of easily understandable subtabs. I'm impressed by how seamlessly the design works in explanations of what each setting does — it makes the whole thing that much more accessible.</p> \n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"jump-link-mac\" style=\"margin-top: 16pt; margin-bottom: 4pt;\">Mac</h3> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">Downloading Norton VPN for Mac is a quick and painless process, with one slight difference from Windows: you'll have to mess around a bit in System Preferences to give Norton the permissions it needs. Fortunately, the setup wizard guides you through the steps with text and animations.</p> \n<figure> \n <img alt=\"mac app norton vpn\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-08/91f16d40-748b-11f0-be3f-ce92971cfe97\" style=\"height: 3000px; width: 4000px;\" /> \n <figcaption></figcaption> \n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n </div> \n</figure> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">The actual interface is just as free of clutter as the Windows app — more so in some cases, as there's no shilling of the rest of the Norton family. The downside is that there's also no help center access from the main window; you have to go to Settings -&gt; Troubleshooting to find the link. There also aren't links to specific help articles like the Windows app includes.</p> \n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"jump-link-android\" style=\"margin-top: 16pt; margin-bottom: 4pt;\">Android</h3> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">One word of warning about Norton VPN's mobile apps: you need an internet connection for the initial login and setup. It doesn't appear to be opening a website, but if you don't have web access, you'll get stuck in an endless loading loop.</p> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">The front pages of Norton VPN's desktop apps don't have many design elements, so the same general schematic is easy to compress onto mobile. The Android client has a status indicator, a large button to start your connection, tabs along the bottom and a gear icon for settings in the top-right. It's all intuitive and responsive.</p> \n<figure> \n <img alt=\"android app norton vpn\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-08/91f16d41-748b-11f0-bfda-2c3032eedba3\" style=\"height: 2340px; width: 1080px;\" /> \n <figcaption></figcaption> \n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n </div> \n</figure> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">If I were to change anything, though, I'd take some of the options from the upper-right settings menu and swap them with the bottom tabs for notifications and accounts settings. VPN preferences should be accessible in one click, especially protocols. Frankly, the messages you get from this app aren't important enough to merit such pride of place.</p> \n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"jump-link-ios\" style=\"margin-top: 16pt; margin-bottom: 4pt;\">iOS</h3> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">Norton VPN's apps for iPhone and iPad are almost identical to its Android app. The only real difference is that the iOS client is missing some features, most notably split tunneling; also, the kill switch is only available on the Mimic protocol, about which there's limited information. Other than that, it feels good to use. While it's not great that Apple users lose out on the full feature set, I can't deny it alleviates the problem of the VPN preferences menu feeling overstuffed.</p> \n<figure> \n <img alt=\"ios app norton vpn\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-08/91f14630-748b-11f0-9eed-b254e6e8fcb7\" style=\"height: 1334px; width: 750px;\" /> \n <figcaption></figcaption> \n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n </div> \n</figure> \n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"jump-link-browser-extensions\" style=\"margin-top: 16pt; margin-bottom: 4pt;\">Browser extensions</h3> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">Norton VPN has browser extensions for Chrome, Firefox and Edge. The only reason to install any of these is to access the ad blocker, which doesn't come with either of the desktop apps. Other than that, it's an underwhelming extension. I recommend skipping it and going with a dedicated ad blocker instead — you'll get more customization features that way.</p> \n<figure> \n <img alt=\"chrome extension norton vpn\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-08/91d66b30-748b-11f0-afef-63aa18aeb9ab\" style=\"height: 1112px; width: 843px;\" /> \n <figcaption></figcaption> \n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n </div> \n</figure> \n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"jump-link-norton-vpn-speed-test\" style=\"margin-top: 18pt; margin-bottom: 6pt;\">Norton VPN speed test</h2> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">Using speedtest.net, I tested Norton VPN to see how much it slowed down my browsing speeds. I then calculated the results as percentages. While different networks give you different starting speeds, the same server location tends to slow down all those networks at about the same rate. You can use this table to estimate how much speed you can expect while Norton VPN is running.</p> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">As a reference, you generally need download speed for loading web pages and videos, upload speed for sending large amounts of data and latency for real-time communication. Latency always increases sharply over longer distances, but a good VPN can still keep the jumps under control. Let's see how Norton VPN did.</p> \n<table> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <td><p><strong>Server location</strong></p> </td> \n   <td><p><strong>Latency (ms)</strong></p> </td> \n   <td><p><strong>Increase factor</strong></p> </td> \n   <td><p><strong>Download speed (Mbps)</strong></p> </td> \n   <td><p><strong>Percentage drop</strong></p> </td> \n   <td><p><strong>Upload speed (Mbps)</strong></p> </td> \n   <td><p><strong>Percentage drop</strong></p> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><p>Portland, OR, USA (unprotected)</p> </td> \n   <td><p>18</p> </td> \n   <td><p>—</p> </td> \n   <td><p>58.90</p> </td> \n   <td><p>—</p> </td> \n   <td><p>5.91</p> </td> \n   <td><p>—</p> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><p>Portland, OR, USA (protected)</p> </td> \n   <td><p>30</p> </td> \n   <td><p>1.7x</p> </td> \n   <td><p>55.83</p> </td> \n   <td><p>5.2</p> </td> \n   <td><p>5.53</p> </td> \n   <td><p>6.4</p> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><p>McAllen, TX, USA</p> </td> \n   <td><p>164</p> </td> \n   <td><p>9.1x</p> </td> \n   <td><p>48.96</p> </td> \n   <td><p>16.9</p> </td> \n   <td><p>5.70</p> </td> \n   <td><p>3.6</p> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><p>Argentina</p> </td> \n   <td><p>422</p> </td> \n   <td><p>23.4x</p> </td> \n   <td><p>43.02</p> </td> \n   <td><p>27.0</p> </td> \n   <td><p>5.72</p> </td> \n   <td><p>3.2</p> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><p>Croatia</p> </td> \n   <td><p>379</p> </td> \n   <td><p>21.1x</p> </td> \n   <td><p>46.35</p> </td> \n   <td><p>21.3</p> </td> \n   <td><p>5.65</p> </td> \n   <td><p>4.4</p> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><p>Nigeria</p> </td> \n   <td><p>564</p> </td> \n   <td><p>31.3x</p> </td> \n   <td><p>39.94</p> </td> \n   <td><p>32.2</p> </td> \n   <td><p>3.86</p> </td> \n   <td><p>34.7</p> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><p>Indonesia</p> </td> \n   <td><p>375</p> </td> \n   <td><p>20.8x</p> </td> \n   <td><p>44.88</p> </td> \n   <td><p>23.8</p> </td> \n   <td><p>5.64</p> </td> \n   <td><p>4.6</p> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><p><strong>Average</strong></p> </td> \n   <td><p><strong>322</strong></p> </td> \n   <td><p><strong>17.9x</strong></p> </td> \n   <td><p><strong>46.50</strong></p> </td> \n   <td><p><strong>21.1</strong></p> </td> \n   <td><p><strong>5.35</strong></p> </td> \n   <td><p><strong>9.5</strong></p> </td> \n  </tr> \n </tbody> \n</table> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">Before I interpret the results, I should mention that the algorithm Norton VPN uses to pick the fastest server doesn't seem to be reliable. Every time I clicked it, it gave me the server in Texas, thousands of miles from my real location in Portland, Oregon. Moreover, the Portland server was obviously faster. This happened repeatedly over multiple days of testing.</p> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">To the point: this table doesn't look good for Norton VPN. Download speeds dropped an average of 21.1 percent, the worst showing of any VPN I've tested so far. What's worse, the data clearly trend toward worse speeds at greater distances. Although it's true that distance impacts download speed as well as latency, it's also true that a well-implemented modern server OS should be able to render that effect minimal.</p> \n<figure> \n <img alt=\"speed test norton vpn\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-08/91e27921-748b-11f0-8b67-d4fd7b70bbb8\" style=\"height: 1344px; width: 3032px;\" /> \n <figcaption></figcaption> \n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n </div> \n</figure> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">Upload speed looks better, with an average drop of under 10 percent — mainly dragged down by the Nigeria server, which cut speeds sharply across every test. Latency is also not awful. Controlling for the expected variance due to distance, Norton VPN beat out both Surfshark and NordVPN in average worldwide ping, which suggests that gaming may be its comfort zone.</p> \n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"jump-link-norton-vpn-security-test\" style=\"margin-top: 18pt; margin-bottom: 6pt;\">Norton VPN security test</h2> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">A VPN's primary job is to change your IP address. While doing this, it must also encrypt your communications with its servers so nobody can follow your connection home — this is what separates a VPN from a simple proxy. In this section, I'll run three checks to see whether Norton VPN can guarantee anonymous browsing.</p> \n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"jump-link-vpn-protocols\" style=\"margin-top: 16pt; margin-bottom: 4pt;\">VPN protocols</h3> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">VPNs use protocols to establish stable connections between your devices and their servers. Most providers pick from the same pool of field-tested options, but you do see a surprise every now and then, like Norton VPN's Mimic.</p> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">Norton VPN's protocol selection follows its general trend of serving very different experiences to users on different platforms. Windows and Android users get WireGuard, OpenVPN and Mimic, while macOS and iOS users only get Mimic and IKEv2. Here's a rundown of each.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><strong>WireGuard </strong>is the most modern open-source VPN protocol currently available. It's almost always the fastest and uses a secure stream cipher for cryptography. The one downside is that it saves your real IP address to keep the connection open. Norton VPN deals with this by assigning temporary dynamic IP addresses during the authentication process.</p></li> \n <li dir=\"ltr\" style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre;\"><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><strong>OpenVPN </strong>is an open source protocol that's been in use for ages. Its source code is slightly clunky after years of volunteers poking it for weaknesses, but that also makes it the most trustworthy option. It's fast on average, though usually slower than WireGuard or IKEv2.</p></li> \n <li dir=\"ltr\" style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre;\"><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><strong>IKEv2 </strong>is a fast protocol that's good at reconnecting mobile devices as they move between networks. Norton VPN uses it in conjunction with IPSec encryption. If you're on an Apple device, it's your only option other than Mimic.</p></li> \n <li><p><strong>Mimic </strong>is an obfuscation protocol, which makes your VPN connection look like regular HTTPS traffic. This can get around networks that block all VPN traffic regardless of content. Mimic is based on TLS 1.3, and uses the same standard encryption algorithms as the other protocols.</p></li> \n</ul> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">Normally, I advise letting your VPN choose what protocol is best. Norton VPN is different. There simply isn't enough information about Mimic for me to trust it, and you shouldn't let the VPN switch you to it without your knowledge. All the others are fine, though.</p> \n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"jump-link-leak-test\" style=\"margin-top: 16pt; margin-bottom: 4pt;\">Leak test</h3> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">Testing a VPN for leaks is easy: just check your IP address before and after connecting, and see if it changes. I used IPleak.net to run that test on several Norton VPN servers. I first observed that Norton VPN prevents IPv6 leaks by blocking IPv6 altogether. On every run, the IPv6 test failed to load, no matter which server location I chose. This is an effective way to make leaks impossible, since almost none of the internet is IPv6-only yet.</p> \n<figure> \n <img alt=\"ipv6 blocked norton vpn\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-08/91e27920-748b-11f0-bedf-852a8f72e847\" style=\"height: 1353px; width: 3246px;\" /> \n <figcaption></figcaption> \n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n </div> \n</figure> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">My second conclusion was that Norton VPN's servers don't leak through DNS or WebRTC while your connection remains stable. However, every time I changed from one location to another, my real IP address was visible on the test screen for several seconds. Enabling the kill switch solved this problem, but the kill switch is not active by default, so make sure you turn it on in the settings.</p> \n<figure> \n <img alt=\"dns leak norton vpn\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-08/91e167b0-748b-11f0-9fbb-2bb34c6d9ad9\" style=\"height: 1380px; width: 2777px;\" /> \n <figcaption></figcaption> \n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n </div> \n</figure> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">There is one other serious problem with this: on the iOS app, the kill switch cannot be used except with the Mimic protocol. This forces users to choose between leaving a hole in their security or trusting it to a protocol with limited transparency. Until this changes, I can't recommend installing Norton VPN on iOS at all.</p> \n<p>I tested the rotating IP server in the United States to see if it had the same problem, and thankfully didn't notice it. A Norton representative also confirmed that all servers have their own DNS resolvers that avoid public servers, cutting off a big source of leaks. Still, I'd recommend keeping the kill switch engaged. As long as you remember this, Norton VPN is secure.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-encryption-test\">Encryption test</h3> \n<p>Finally, I ran a test with WireShark to see if Norton VPN's protocols managed to encrypt my traffic. Since I've been uncertain about Mimic, I used it for the encryption test. I found that Mimic does in fact encrypt data packets, even on an unsecured HTTP connection. WireShark also confirmed to me that Mimic is using TLS for key exchange and encryption.</p> \n<figure> \n <img alt=\"encryption test norton vpn\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-08/91e2a030-748b-11f0-9e7f-e4ce2d807698\" style=\"height: 1164px; width: 3329px;\" /> \n <figcaption></figcaption> \n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n </div> \n</figure> \n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"jump-link-how-much-does-norton-vpn-cost\" style=\"margin-top: 18pt; margin-bottom: 6pt;\">How much does Norton VPN cost?</h2> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">Norton VPN subscriptions are only available for one year at a time — there's no monthly option. There are three different subscription tiers, summarized in the table below. \"Number of devices\" refers to how many devices you can have installed on a single account, whether or not any of them are connected to the VPN.</p> \n<table> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <td><p><strong>Subscription</strong></p> </td> \n   <td><p><strong>Starting price (One year)</strong></p> </td> \n   <td><p><strong>Renewal price (One year)</strong></p> </td> \n   <td><p><strong>Number of devices</strong></p> </td> \n   <td><p><strong>Features</strong></p> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><p>Standard</p> </td> \n   <td><p>$39.99</p> </td> \n   <td><p>$79.99</p> </td> \n   <td><p>5</p> </td> \n   <td><p>Basic VPN service, IP rotation, double VPN, kill switch</p> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><p>Plus</p> </td> \n   <td><p>$49.99</p> </td> \n   <td><p>$109.99</p> </td> \n   <td><p>5</p> </td> \n   <td><p>Antivirus, password manager, dark web alerts, 10GB cloud backup</p> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><p>Ultimate</p> </td> \n   <td><p>$59.99</p> </td> \n   <td><p>$129.99</p> </td> \n   <td><p>10</p> </td> \n   <td><p>Parental controls, device locator</p> </td> \n  </tr> \n </tbody> \n</table> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">The Standard subscription is a reasonable price for what you get, but the superior Proton VPN is barely more expensive and Surfshark is actually cheaper. In other words, Norton VPN is a good price, but not great value — especially when you factor in the renewal prices, all of which force you to pay double or more what you paid the first time. If you'd like to decide for yourself, all the plans do come with a 60-day money-back guarantee.</p> \n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"jump-link-norton-vpn-side-apps-and-bundles\" style=\"margin-top: 18pt; margin-bottom: 6pt;\">Norton VPN side apps and bundles</h2> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">Norton is better known as an antivirus company than a VPN provider, so naturally Norton VPN is packaged with the rest of the Norton 360 family. Be warned — unless you turn the option off in the Settings -&gt; Privacy tab, Norton will collect information on your app usage and use it to target you with ads for its other products.</p> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">Norton 360 is a massive product line encompassing dozens of individual subscriptions. To keep this section from bloating, I'll focus on the software available as part of an upgraded Norton VPN subscription, then end by listing the Norton 360 plans that include Norton VPN.</p> \n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"jump-link-features-on-norton-vpn-plus\" style=\"margin-top: 16pt; margin-bottom: 4pt;\">Features on Norton VPN Plus</h3> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">A Norton VPN Plus subscription adds several features from Norton's antivirus suite, but isn't a complete replacement for Norton or any other dedicated antivirus software. Plus users get most of the antivirus features that work in real time, including a smart firewall, anti-ransomware backups, a sandbox for quarantining suspicious programs and a malicious script blocker.</p> \n<p>VPN subscribers do not get access to the quicker Smart Scan option, instead getting a different scan feature that checks for online threats (note that the <a href=\"https://support.norton.com/sp/en/us/home/current/solutions/v20240726114723559\">FAQ page</a> about this erroneously says Norton VPN includes Smart Scan). VPN users also miss out on the LiveUpdate feature that installs security patches autonomously, plus the automated hard drive cleaner.</p> \n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"jump-link-features-on-norton-vpn-ultimate\" style=\"margin-top: 16pt; margin-bottom: 4pt;\">Features on Norton VPN Ultimate</h3> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">In addition to raising the device limit to 10, Norton VPN Ultimate adds two features on top of Plus: parental controls and Privacy Monitor. The latter is only available in the US and Canada.</p> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">Parental control is both a time-based site blocker and a monitoring app. It can not only track a child's internet activity, but also their physical location, giving you alerts if they leave set boundaries during a certain time (say school property during a weekday). Privacy Monitor scans for your information on data brokerage sites so you can send deletion requests, similar to Surfshark Incogni.</p> \n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"jump-link-norton-360-plans-that-include-norton-vpn\" style=\"margin-top: 16pt; margin-bottom: 4pt;\">Norton 360 plans that include Norton VPN</h3> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">Instead of subscribing to Norton VPN directly, you can also pick a Norton 360 plan that includes VPN service. Norton 360 Standard and Norton 360 For Gamers each let you install Norton VPN on three devices. Norton 360 Deluxe raises that number to five, while Norton 360 with Lifelock Select and Norton 360 with Lifelock Advantage grant you 10 total VPN installs. Norton 360 with Lifelock Ultimate Plus lets you install Norton VPN on an unlimited number of devices.</p> \n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"jump-link-close-reading-norton-vpns-privacy-policy\" style=\"margin-top: 18pt; margin-bottom: 6pt;\">Close-reading Norton VPN's privacy policy</h2> \n<p>To assess Norton VPN's privacy, we need to look at two different privacy policies. Like I said in the introduction, there are technically two products called Norton VPN — the standalone service I've been reviewing and the VPN features of the Norton 360 bundle. I've been focused on the independent Norton VPN so far, but since the Norton 360 VPN add-on is a privacy risk, I want to mention it here.</p> \n<p>Norton lists the privacy policies for each of its products <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=02faf16c-8eea-4114-a20e-7db1c0f119c0&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=9a9a32a1-c506-4077-9db1-d8922d34d6e3&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Norton&amp;linkText=on+one+page&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3VzLm5vcnRvbi5jb20vcHJpdmFjeS9wcm9kdWN0cy1wcml2YWN5LW5vdGljZSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiOWE5YTMyYTEtYzUwNi00MDc3LTlkYjEtZDg5MjJkMzRkNmUzIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3VzLm5vcnRvbi5jb20vcHJpdmFjeS9wcm9kdWN0cy1wcml2YWN5LW5vdGljZSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAdfybE3QXdIAEk4MrKsD0ivrDzcCR8tdiV_Nh_kvQ_dW&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fus.norton.com%2Fprivacy%2Fproducts-privacy-notice\">on one page</a> of its website. The VPN feature of Norton 360 is governed by the top two policies, Norton Security Products (desktop) and Norton 360 Mobile Apps. The standalone Norton VPN has its own policy further down the page.</p> \n<p>The Norton 360 policy is a privacy nightmare. Both the desktop and mobile apps claim the right to save your IP address, device fingerprints and web activity for up to 36 months, and there's no exception for the VPN feature. I strongly advise against using Norton 360's bundled VPN for any activity you don't want Norton seeing.</p> \n<p>Fortunately, Norton holds the standalone VPN to a much more acceptable set of rules. It isn't permitted to collect IP addresses, browsing history or DNS requests, nor can it share any of the data it does collect with partners. The partners note is important because one of Norton's sibling companies, Avast, is known to have <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-27-avast-jumpshot-selling-user-data.html\">sold information on its users</a> to corporations for ad targeting. A Norton representative stated that Avast is no longer involved in harvesting or selling user data. More importantly, he said that no data from VPN products is shared between Gen Digital brands.</p> \n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"jump-link-independent-privacy-audits\" style=\"margin-top: 16pt; margin-bottom: 4pt;\">Independent privacy audits</h3> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">A recent audit by penetration testing firm VerSprite provides reason to be hopeful about Norton VPN's privacy. According to a report published in August 2024, <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=02faf16c-8eea-4114-a20e-7db1c0f119c0&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=9a9a32a1-c506-4077-9db1-d8922d34d6e3&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Norton&amp;linkText=which+you+can+download+from+this+page&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3VzLm5vcnRvbi5jb20vZmVhdHVyZS9ub3J0b24tdnBuLW5vLWxvZy1wb2xpY3kiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjlhOWEzMmExLWM1MDYtNDA3Ny05ZGIxLWQ4OTIyZDM0ZDZlMyIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly91cy5ub3J0b24uY29tL2ZlYXR1cmUvbm9ydG9uLXZwbi1uby1sb2ctcG9saWN5In0&amp;signature=AQAAAaB644obAjaQlco0Y5Uk1GrFOEoY3MPUSlTv0cYp-I2U&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fus.norton.com%2Ffeature%2Fnorton-vpn-no-log-policy\">which you can download from this page</a>, VerSprite found that Norton VPN posed an overall \"low\" privacy risk, judged on a scale of low, medium, high and critical risks.</p> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">During their audit, VerSprite informed Norton that certain conditions could make VPN users identifiable. In a second round of tests, Norton appears to have fixed those vulnerabilities. That's certainly reassuring, but I wish the report — which only runs three pages in all — was more specific about what the problem actually was. Regardless, the VerSprite audit is a good sign that Norton VPN is taking privacy more seriously than Norton as a whole.</p> \n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"jump-link-can-norton-vpn-change-your-virtual-location\" style=\"margin-top: 18pt; margin-bottom: 6pt;\">Can Norton VPN change your virtual location?</h2> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">If a VPN can change your virtual location, it can not only throw ISPs and other interlopers off your real identity, but also change what you see on the internet — especially on streaming sites, where connecting through a different country can unlock new shows. However, Netflix and its brethren block VPN traffic for copyright reasons, so it's never a guarantee that you'll get in.</p> \n<figure> \n <img alt=\"netflix canada norton vpn\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-08/91f14631-748b-11f0-bff7-08439abfd41b\" style=\"height: 1213px; width: 3165px;\" /> \n <figcaption></figcaption> \n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n </div> \n</figure> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">I tested Norton VPN's ability to unblock Netflix on five different locations, connecting three times on three different servers in each place. I set the app to automatically choose the protocol. In the table below, you'll see how many tests each location passed, and whether Netflix showed new content each time. If I get into Netflix but the library doesn't change, that indicates the server might be leaky.</p> \n<table> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <td><p><strong>Server location</strong></p> </td> \n   <td><p><strong>Unblocked Netflix?</strong></p> </td> \n   <td><p><strong>Changed content?</strong></p> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><p>Vancouver, Canada</p> </td> \n   <td><p>3/3</p> </td> \n   <td><p>3/3</p> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><p>Iceland</p> </td> \n   <td><p>0/3</p> </td> \n   <td><p>0/3</p> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><p>Latvia</p> </td> \n   <td><p>3/3</p> </td> \n   <td><p>3/3</p> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><p>Morocco</p> </td> \n   <td><p>3/3</p> </td> \n   <td><p>3/3</p> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><p>Philippines</p> </td> \n   <td><p>3/3</p> </td> \n   <td><p>3/3</p> </td> \n  </tr> \n </tbody> \n</table> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">I had no problems in four out of five of the locations I tested, but Netflix utterly defeated the Iceland servers. No matter how many times I disconnected and reconnected to get a new IP address, Netflix recognized a VPN server and blocked me. This happened even when I switched to the Mimic protocol.</p> \n<figure> \n <img alt=\"iceland blocked norton vpn\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-08/91f16d42-748b-11f0-ba77-52e36d4c5e8b\" style=\"height: 1782px; width: 3282px;\" /> \n <figcaption></figcaption> \n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n </div> \n</figure> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">That indicates that Netflix has blocklisted most or all of Norton VPN's servers in Iceland, and the company hasn't caught up. It's another troubling indication that Norton isn't committing the level of attention that its server network requires.</p> \n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"jump-link-investigating-norton-vpns-server-network\" style=\"margin-top: 18pt; margin-bottom: 6pt;\">Investigating Norton VPN's server network</h2> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">Speaking of the server network, now's the time to get deeper into it. The relative scarcity of different IP addresses on Norton VPN, along with the download speed drops over long distances, suggest to me that Norton might have relegated maintaining VPN data centers to an afterthought. So, let's see what its worldwide server selection looks like.</p> \n<table> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <td><p><strong>Region</strong></p> </td> \n   <td><p><strong>Countries with servers</strong></p> </td> \n   <td><p><strong>Total server locations</strong></p> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><p>North America</p> </td> \n   <td><p>5</p> </td> \n   <td><p>32</p> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><p>South America</p> </td> \n   <td><p>6</p> </td> \n   <td><p>6</p> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><p>Europe</p> </td> \n   <td><p>36</p> </td> \n   <td><p>47</p> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><p>Africa</p> </td> \n   <td><p>5</p> </td> \n   <td><p>5</p> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><p>Middle East</p> </td> \n   <td><p>2</p> </td> \n   <td><p>2</p> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><p>Asia</p> </td> \n   <td><p>10</p> </td> \n   <td><p>10</p> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><p>Oceania</p> </td> \n   <td><p>2</p> </td> \n   <td><p>4</p> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><p>Total</p> </td> \n   <td><p>66</p> </td> \n   <td><p>106</p> </td> \n  </tr> \n </tbody> \n</table> \n<p>All of Norton VPN's server locations are physical, with no virtual locations. This makes its network more reliable — virtual server locations can deliver unexpected speed swings. However, it does limit the number of locations Norton is capable of offering.</p> \n<p>The selection is reasonably good, with many locations in often-underserved Africa and South America, and many options in marquee regions like the US and Europe. However, it's a pretty small network for what Norton is charging. Also, as we saw with the Iceland location getting blocked by Netflix, having a country on the menu doesn't necessarily mean it will do the job.</p> \n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"jump-link-extra-features-of-norton-vpn\" style=\"margin-top: 18pt; margin-bottom: 6pt;\">Extra features of Norton VPN</h2> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">Norton VPN added a ton of features in the first several months of 2025. Most of these mainly brought it up to par with other VPNs, like city-level region selection or support for smart TVs. However, there are one or two you won't find in many other places, like the IP rotator — to my knowledge, nobody else has that except Surfshark. Here are the most important extras to know about.</p> \n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"jump-link-ad-blocker\" style=\"margin-top: 16pt; margin-bottom: 4pt;\">Ad blocker</h3> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">Norton VPN's ad blocker can be used on its browser extension. Its mobile apps can block the trackers embedded in ads, but not the ads themselves. There's not a lot of customization potential; you can turn it on and off, and that's mainly it. The one option you have on the extension is to turn \"acceptable ads\" back on. This can help you get into sites that normally block users with adblock on, or use sites where you want to see ads to help them monetize.</p> \n<figure> \n <img alt=\"Ad tracker blocker norton vpn\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-08/91d35df0-748b-11f0-bff3-145cf60d58cb\" style=\"height: 2340px; width: 1080px;\" /> \n <figcaption></figcaption> \n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n </div> \n</figure> \n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"jump-link-double-vpn-and-ip-rotator\" style=\"margin-top: 16pt; margin-bottom: 4pt;\">Double VPN and IP rotator</h3> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">Norton introduced these two features in 2025 as \"enhanced anonymity\" upgrades. Double VPN runs your VPN through two server locations instead of one, so you're still safe if one server breaks down. You can choose from eight pre-determined multi-hop paths with endpoints in the USA, the UK, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Japan, Germany and Taiwan.</p> \n<figure> \n <img alt=\"double hop norton vpn\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-08/91e25210-748b-11f0-adbf-6a2dd84b8100\" style=\"height: 1345px; width: 2006px;\" /> \n <figcaption></figcaption> \n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n </div> \n</figure> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">IP rotation servers change your IP address frequently while you're connected, which makes you harder to track. Unlike Surfshark, which lets you turn this on everywhere, Norton VPN limits you to six IP rotator locations: the USA, the UK, Canada, Japan, Germany and Australia.</p> \n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"jump-link-convenience-features\" style=\"margin-top: 16pt; margin-bottom: 4pt;\">Convenience features</h3> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">The next three features were also added in the last eight months. The server location menu now puts your last five locations at the top for easy retrieval. While connected to a server, you can pause the VPN for 15, 30 or 60 minutes, after which it turns back on. Finally, the mobile apps have added a home screen widget so you can operate the VPN without opening the app.</p> \n<figure> \n <img alt=\"pause connection norton vpn\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-08/91d75590-748b-11f0-b37f-77b98e25959e\" style=\"height: 1344px; width: 2014px;\" /> \n <figcaption></figcaption> \n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n </div> \n</figure> \n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"jump-link-kill-switch\" style=\"margin-top: 16pt; margin-bottom: 4pt;\">Kill switch</h3> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">A VPN kill switch cuts off your internet access if you lose your VPN connection, so any sensitive information isn't broadcast unprotected. Norton VPN's kill switch is vital, since it appears to briefly drop encryption while switching server locations. Unfortunately, it's not available on iOS.</p> \n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"jump-link-split-tunneling\" style=\"margin-top: 16pt; margin-bottom: 4pt;\">Split tunneling</h3> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">The Windows and Android apps for Norton VPN allow split tunneling, in which only certain apps go through the VPN while others connect directly. Norton uses app-based split tunneling, but if you want to protect or remove protection from specific URLs, you can use two different web browsers.</p> \n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"jump-link-wi-fi-security\" style=\"margin-top: 16pt; margin-bottom: 4pt;\">Wi-Fi security</h3> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">This feature, which appears on NortonVPN's mobile apps only, activates whenever you connect to a Wi-Fi network. Norton VPN scans that network for common attacks launched over Wi-Fi, like DNS poisoning and SSL stripping, and sends you an alert if it detects any.</p> \n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"jump-link-p2p-optimization\" style=\"margin-top: 16pt; margin-bottom: 4pt;\">P2P optimization</h3> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">Norton VPN has certain servers in its network configured for torrenting. You can't use it for torrenting outside those locations — if you try, the VPN will disconnect. To connect to a P2P server, just select \"P2P-optimized region\" from the server menu. You can't choose a torrenting server in a specific region; the app just selects the fastest.</p> \n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"jump-link-norton-vpn-customer-support-options\" style=\"margin-top: 18pt; margin-bottom: 6pt;\">Norton VPN customer support options</h2> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">Following the broad trend of Norton VPN, the Windows app gets most of the love, having much more in-app support than any other platform. Mac users get a troubleshooting tab in the settings menu, with three options: go to the online help center, send a bug report or go to the community forum. iOS and Android just have a \"help and support\" button on the accounts page that sends you straight to the website.</p> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">On Windows, there's a separate help and support tab above the settings tab, which gives you direct links to some of the most important pages on the Norton website. It's also got links to the forum and help center. Then there's the same troubleshooting tab as the Mac app, but with more options. Windows users can reset the app to default, record a problem to get more specific help, send debug logs and run an automated \"Repair Norton\" process.</p> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">If you got to the website through a desktop app, it's surprisingly difficult to get to the general support page for Norton VPN — Windows links to a splintered set of FAQ pages, while Mac sends you to a Mac-specific page for the entire Norton Family. I recommend just going to support.norton.com in your browser, then clicking the Norton VPN button. At least the links in both mobile apps take you straight there.</p> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">Once you have gotten to the Norton VPN support page, you won't find much of use. Help articles are limited and leave some big holes. For example, all connectivity problems are limited to a page called \"Fix problem accessing the internet when connected to Norton VPN.\" The only advice for Windows, Mac and Android is to choose a different VPN protocol, and there's nothing at all for iOS.</p> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">Even worse, whenever you use the search bar to look anything up, you're forced to watch an AI answer type itself out in real time, so links to the actual help pages are constantly jumping around as you try to click on them. It's this feature that pushes Norton's help pages from negligent to hostile.</p> \n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"jump-link-live-support-experience\" style=\"margin-top: 16pt; margin-bottom: 4pt;\">Live support experience</h3> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">There are a few other ways to get support from Norton VPN. You can check in on the community forum, chat live with an agent or call their phone line. The forums are reasonably active for Windows, but pretty dead for all other platforms.</p> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">I used live chat to ask about a problem with installing the iOS app. I managed to reach a human pretty quickly, but there were several long pauses during our conversation. Eventually, they escalated my case to a higher support team.</p> \n<figure> \n <img alt=\"live chat norton vpn\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-08/91d66b30-748b-11f0-bdff-1b3d4d888c6f\" style=\"height: 1753px; width: 2963px;\" /> \n <figcaption></figcaption> \n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n </div> \n</figure> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">I assumed that this team would send me an email, per standard practice. Instead, they repeatedly tried to reach me by phone. I was not warned that they would do this, and each time, the call was flagged as spam. By the time I realized Norton was calling me, I'd already solved the problem myself. Be aware of this if you plan to contact Norton with a difficult issue.</p> \n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"jump-link-norton-vpn-background-check\" style=\"margin-top: 18pt; margin-bottom: 6pt;\">Norton VPN background check</h2> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">The Norton software brand has existed in some form or another since the Norton Utilities package was developed for DOS in 1982. The brand was acquired in 1990 by Symantec, which had published its own first antivirus program the year before. Symantec began releasing Norton Antivirus in 1991, and continued distributing it until its merger with Avast in 2022. Since then, the combined company has been called Gen Digital.</p> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">Compared to that long history, Norton VPN has only been around for a blip. It <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/norton-adds-a-vpn-and-more-to-its-refreshed-360-products\">launched in 2019</a> as part of Symantec's bid to expand the Norton Antivirus line into a suite that could defend against more types of threats. As such, while Norton and Symantec have been involved in their share of controversies over the years, very few of them happened during Norton VPN's lifetime.</p> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">Despite Norton's long and checkered history, checking the background of its VPN is pretty simple: nothing has gone seriously wrong yet. This VPN has problems, but they're mainly out in the open, stemming from it being a relative afterthought from a company more focused on other types of security.</p> \n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"jump-link-final-verdict\" style=\"margin-top: 18pt; margin-bottom: 6pt;\">Final verdict</h2> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">For me to recommend a VPN, it has to stand out in a crowded field. After a week of working with Norton VPN, I have to conclude that the only way it distinguishes itself is the Norton name. For everything else it does, a competitor does it better. Surfshark scoops it on IP rotation and multihop, ExpressVPN has better protocols, NordVPN is faster and Proton VPN's ad blocker works in more places.</p> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">One thing I will say in Norton VPN's favor is that it's working to rectify all this. In the last year, it's added a lot of features. The problem is that most of those are options I'd have expected it to have already, such as city-level region selection and a kill switch on Mac. It's catching up, not innovating.</p> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">It's also nice that you can use the bundles to roll more Norton products into one subscription. However, since Norton is much more experienced at developing other sorts of security software, I'd advise going the Norton 360 route if you're interested in those other features and treating the VPN as an add-on. Norton VPN is a side dish, not an entree.</p> \n<p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/norton-vpn-review-a-vpn-that-fails-to-meet-nortons-standards-170037086.html?src=rss"}

That helped it cast a wide net (and probably make more money), but it also came with technical limitations.

Both the PS5 Pro and Xbox Series X will reach 2160p at 60fps. However, the two high-end systems will support Dynamic 4K resolution. Meanwhile, the Xbox Series S will run at 1080p at 60fps or 1440p at 30fps.

The basic gameplay remains, with players being asked to feed, groom and play with small digital creatures inside a handheld device. But new features have also been added, like Bluetooth connectivity and downloadable content (they're also <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/heres-the-absolutely-massive-tamagotchi-paradise-next-to-other-objects-in-the-wild-for-scale-172017149.html\">a little bigger</a> than before). This month, however, Hasbro is throwing its hat into the ring with the Nano-Mals, a $20 device that takes the standard features of a virtual pet and aims them toward a new purpose: fidget toy.</p> \n<p>The first thing you’ll probably notice when you pick up one of the eight initial Nano-Mals models is how cute they all are: they’re styled after both common and uncommon animals, including two cows, two cats, a red panda, a narwhal, and a pair of unicorns.But the second thing you’ll notice is that there’s no screen to be found anywhere; instead, the sole “display” is a a light-up heart on the front of the toy that has three levels and changes color to indicate how satiated the toy is in terms of hunger, affection and play.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span> \n<p>How you fulfill these needs is where the Nano-mals distinguish themselves from other virtual pets: Instead of pushing buttons and navigating through various menus, you interact instead with the various parts of the toy directly. Push down on its ear to “pet” it, flip its arms to “dance” and push its nose to “feed” it. The more you perform these actions, the more each color of the heart will fill up, eventually resulting in a rainbow kaleidoscope across the toy’s chest.</p> \n<p>It’s incredibly easy to do, not just because these are simple actions, but because they’re engineered to be satisfying since it is a fidget toy. It feels good to flip the arms up and down and squish the ears. Not so much for pushing the shallow nose button though, meaning it was often the need that took the longest for me to fulfill. It just wasn’t fun to push the nose! I can only hope that future iterations improve on this.</p> \n<p>Once you’ve figured out the basic functions, it becomes a game in itself to figure out the best way to hold and interact with the device. You don’t need to look at it and the entire thing can be operated with one hand, which is exactly what you want in a fidget toy. I found myself rotating it between my fingers while flipping the arms – the device also contains an accelerometer so any significant movement also counts as “play.”</p> \n<p>If you have more than one Nano-mal – which is quite likely given the device’s low price – the toys will interact with each other, lighting up and talking to each other. It’s cute but also a bit unsettling, as it was very reminiscent of this year’s Black Mirror episode “Playthings” with the Nano-mals emitting mysterious bleats and chimes just like the Thronglets. Fortunately, there is an off switch, and the Nano-mals will burble happily before shutting down when you use it.</p> \n<figure> \n <img alt=\"Hands-on photo of Hasboro's Nano-Mals fidget toys.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-08/29b27680-784a-11f0-bfc7-47b0ec963810\" style=\"height: 2268px; width: 4032px;\" /> \n <figcaption></figcaption> \n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n   Kris Naudus for Engadget \n </div> \n</figure> \n<p>However, the off switch isn’t absolute as, should you press any of the buttons, the Nano-mal will still react, though maybe not effusively as if the device were powered fully on. This is a problem given that the Nano-mal is meant to be taken out and about (there’s even a clip at the top), but will likely be banned from classrooms due to the possibility of it being accidentally triggered when a kid moves their stuff. The toys can be muted by holding down the nose for a few seconds, but it only works when the device is fully powered on, and resets every time the Nano-mal is turned off and on.</p> \n<p>Aside from that and the fact that I couldn’t remove the attachment clip, which got in the way when I was trying to spin the device in my hand, I think the Nano-mal is a solid first try at this kind of toy. Kids will love how cute they are, especially when you dress them up in the included clothes, which double as protective cases for the devices. And adults will appreciate them too: Parents are big on screen-free devices, while the young-at-heart will appreciate having something to keep their hands busy that isn’t their phone.</p> \n<p>The Nano-mals are available now at all major toy retailers, including <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=3719d8d4-5edd-4817-998a-91f3229e7323&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=f1960b1f-5003-451b-abd3-205b4b90cdf5&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Walmart&amp;linkText=Walmart&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy53YWxtYXJ0LmNvbS9zaG9wL25hbm9tYWxzIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJmMTk2MGIxZi01MDAzLTQ1MWItYWJkMy0yMDViNGI5MGNkZjUiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndhbG1hcnQuY29tL3Nob3AvbmFub21hbHMifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAVH8Mwa3CRYpfPmbdo30AsYW5pKVj07MBQqmCK3EpUoL&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fshop%2Fnanomals\">Walmart</a> and <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B0DNG7729S&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=f1960b1f-5003-451b-abd3-205b4b90cdf5&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=Amazon&amp;custData=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&amp;signature=AQAAAcVQme3mNZu3WN4xReUtYJwZ06M1Eor51TJsxdIRjk-2&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FNANO-MALS-Stardream-Electronic-Responses-Interactive%2Fdp%2FB0DNG7729S\">Amazon</a>.</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/hasbros-nano-mals-are-a-virtual-pet-that-rewards-fidgeting-141553387.html?src=rss"}

So instead of watchOS 12, I’ve spent the past two weeks with the public beta of watchOS 26. The naming scheme shift is subtle, but helpful — which is how I’d describe the upgrades the new software brings to the Apple Watch. The AI-powered Workout Buddy better contextualizes your Fitness data and an added gesture gives the watch a fun trick that’s actually helpful. Other upgrades — including better smart replies and the Liquid Glass treatment — all combine to make the watch work and look a bit better than it did before. It’s not a game-changing shift, like <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/ios-26-public-beta-is-available-to-download-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-new-iphone-and-ipad-update-135749331.html\">other OS 26 releases</a>, but it manages to make a great watch a touch better.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-luminous-liquid-glass\">Luminous Liquid Glass</h2>\n<p>Every Apple operating system got the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/ios-26-beta-preview-liquid-glass-is-better-than-you-think-172155402.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAAEufKxgWteWNCu3R9pldJLME6Ik2e013731N1jiT3NntZJaG_DoowjYuTcFJADyOVagbkTD2n414zlqmwDrHUBEe7rWdtkotScjOaree7X0ti2EPpyS7W5tCyXVuC-ssLrpsXn2HlciPxCLjeIdZBCr5zYYH3aI8uj_PvkOJXEi\">Liquid Glass treatment</a> this year, including watchOS 26. The change is less noticeable on the Apple Watch than on the iPhone or iPad, though. You’ll notice the semi-transparent buttons and flowy movement when entering your password and opening the control center — the icons look like they’re surrounded in little drops of water, which is quite pretty. You’ll see it on the Photos watch face, too, especially if you select the “glass” color for the time readout.&nbsp;</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><figure><img alt=\"The time numerals get the Liquid Glass treatment with the Photos watch face. \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-08/b788fde0-76d7-11f0-bdff-222bc9dc0f43\" style=\"height: 1441px; width: 2560px;\" /><figcaption>The Liquid Glass treatment for the Photos watch face.&nbsp;</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Amy Skorheim for Engadget</div></figure>\n<p>The Smart Stack now has a liminal glow and the app icons are likewise a touch more luminous than before. The effect is subtle and nicely unifies the look of the watch and its companion iPhone. Like all design upgrades, Liquid Glass made me feel like I was using a new watch — though, like everything, the novelty wore off after a week or two.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-revamped-workout-app-combines-ai-stats-with-a-dj\">Revamped Workout app combines AI stats with a DJ</h2>\n<p>In addition to the Buddy, the Workout app has a new look with icons in each of the four corners of the screen that give you easier access to adjust your data view, play music, set goals and tweak Buddy settings. My favorite new feature is in the music menu and it’s limited to Apple Music for now. If you tap the music icon, you have the option to auto-play music. From there, you can also select “Picked for you” or “Choose media.” The former will select music that matches the type of workout you’re doing and what you like to listen to. As someone who gets derailed from pretty much all my tasks when I have to interact with my phone, I appreciate anything that can make decisions for me and prevent me from reaching for it.</p>\n<p>I was presented with peppy beats that matched the cadence of my run, from bands and artists that were familiar as well as new-to-me selections that fit my tastes. Unfortunately, it didn’t always work correctly. Sometimes I’d get no music, other times the music would play but the Workout Buddy would fall silent. I realize I’m testing a public beta of watchOS 26, so I’m holding out hope the feature will work at launch. Because when it worked, it was glorious.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"A person holds an apple watch 10 displaying the new workout app\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-08/a7ba9680-77b3-11f0-acfb-bc5c489c2f1a\" style=\"height: 1440px; width: 2560px;\" /><figcaption>The new Workout app layout.&nbsp;</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Amy Skorheim for Engadget</div></figure>\n<p>The new Workout Buddy is probably the biggest AI play in watchOS 26. It uses historical and real-time data collected by your watch to give you a window into how you’re performing at the beginning, end and throughout a workout. It works for walking, running, cycling and other workouts but requires headphones and a nearby Apple Intelligence-<a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-intelligence-what-devices-and-features-will-actually-be-supported-185850732.html\">compatible</a> iPhone. That gave me pause. I hate carrying stuff and/or sticking things in my ears when I run. But after acquiring some open earbuds and digging out my old <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B0D3HWPZ85&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=012d64a0-674e-4646-8e36-d4ee0d9de2a5&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=Spibelt&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2RwL0IwRDNIV1BaODU_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMDEyZDY0YTAtNjc0ZS00NjQ2LThlMzYtZDRlZTBkOWRlMmE1Iiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2RwL0IwRDNIV1BaODUiLCJkeW5hbWljQ2VudHJhbFRyYWNraW5nSWQiOnRydWUsInNpdGVJZCI6InVzLWVuZ2FkZ2V0IiwicGFnZUlkIjoiMXAtYXV0b2xpbmsiLCJmZWF0dXJlSWQiOiJ0ZXh0LWxpbmsifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAUU3NfOtvYuctRlpN9eW700wJ1FbPL4M09KujCOg7Roj&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0D3HWPZ85\">Spibelt</a>, I made it work.</p>\n<p>There are three voices to choose from as of this writing, a bright feminine option, a British male-sounding one and another female-presenting version with a lower register. These were built on vocal data from Fitness+ trainers and have an authentic sound to them. At the start of a workout, you’ll get a brief pep talk along with some recent milestones. My pre-game walking and running talks included references to the day of the week, my location and accumulated fitness data. For example, “Way to get out there on a Wednesday morning walk in Albuquerque. So far this week, you’ve done three walking workouts. Let’s get in some steps!”</p>\n<p>Depending on the type of exercise, you can set target ranges for cadence, heart rate, speed, distance, power (cycling), time and others. During a workout, the AI will let you know if you’re at, below or above those levels. The first time I tried Workout Buddy, my run was quite lonely. I didn’t realize I had to turn on the Buddy, as well as the various goal metrics within the Workout app. I did that and, on my next run, the AI delivered cadence and heart rate updates, and let me know when I hit milestones like distance and duration.</p>\n<p>At the end of a workout, you’ll see a thinking animation as the AI assembles a summary. It’ll recap data like your pace, distance, average and peak heart rate, as well as progress on your Activity rings. It’ll also point out comparisons or cumulative milestones you may have hit. For example, after a longer walk, it told me that I’d just burned the most calories on a walk so far. Another day, it told me I’d walked ten miles so far this week. It closes the update by encouraging you to take the energy into the rest of your day or something similarly positive but measured.</p>\n<p>That’s a big improvement over the first few times I used the feature. My first few pep talks were cloying, telling me something along the lines of “It’s not easy to get out there early in the morning!” and “Your effort is inspiring!&quot; After I stopped a run early to fuss with settings, it told me I did a “Great job!” on a three-minute run. Thankfully, Apple appears to be tweaking the Buddy behind the scenes, calibrating the AI’s “personality.” Recent pep talks have become noticeably less sycophantic and therefore more enjoyable. I imagine the Buddy will only continue to evolve even more from here.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-the-workout-buddy-is-not-a-coach\">The Workout Buddy is not a coach</h2>\n<p>The Workout Buddy is a motivational experience that provides personalized insights you can use to gauge your performance. But I just finished trying out <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-8-review-samsungs-best-smartwatch-in-years-155857108.html#:~:text=browsing%20your%20tiles.-,The%20running%20coach,-made%20me%20mad\">Samsung’s AI running coach</a> on the Galaxy Watch and couldn’t help comparing the two. That coach pushed me to run five kilometers for the first time in my life. The Buddy made me feel like I’d accomplished something special just by taking my dog on a stroll. Both have their place, but I’d say Apple’s version is probably best for those who already know what their goals are and what they need to do to hit them. Samsung’s version may be better for beginners who want some help shaping their fitness journey.</p>\n<p>In addition to the Buddy, the Workout app has a new look with icons in each of the four corners of the screen that give you easier access to adjust your data view, play music, set goals and tweak Buddy settings. My favorite new feature is in the music menu and it’s limited to Apple Music for now. If you tap the music icon, you have the option to auto-play music. From there, you can also select “Picked for you” or “Choose media.” The former will select music that matches the type of workout you’re doing and what you like to listen to. As someone who gets derailed from pretty much all my tasks when I have to interact with my phone, I appreciate anything that can make decisions for me and prevent me from reaching for it.</p>\n<p>I was presented with peppy beats that matched the cadence of my run, from bands and artists that were familiar as well as new-to-me selections that fit my tastes. Unfortunately, it didn’t always work correctly. Sometimes I’d get no music, other times the music would play but the Workout Buddy would fall silent. I realize I’m testing a public beta of watchOS 26, so I’m holding out hope the feature will work at launch. Because when it worked, it was glorious.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-more-hands-free-fun-with-wrist-flick\">More hands-free fun with wrist flick</h2>\n<p>I love the double tap gesture Apple <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-is-now-live-with-double-tap--heres-how-to-customize-the-gesture-on-watchos-101-133021753.html\">introduced</a> with the Apple Watch Series 9 — it’s a pleasure to stop timers, start auto-detected workouts and answer calls without getting my other hand involved. But it took some practice before I could reliably get the watch to recognize the gesture. (The trick is raising your wrist in an exaggerated checking-the-time motion then quickly, but not too quickly, tapping your thumb and finger together twice.)</p>\n<p>Luckily, the new Wrist Flick motion introduced in watchOS 26 takes practically no effort to get right. It involves quickly turning the back of your wrist away from you and back up again. Doing that can silence a call, stop a ringing timer, dismiss notifications and return you to the watch face from any app you open. It also makes those <del>irritating</del> helpful “Time to stand!” reminders go away. The wrist flick doesn’t clear alerts, just dismisses them — so the red indicator dot disappears, but the notification remains and you can see it if you swipe down. Just note that it’s only available to Apple Watch Series 9, 10 and the Ultra 2.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"A demonstration of clearing notifications with the wrist flick gesture\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-08/11f22670-77ba-11f0-b6f9-6996b2529ca4\" style=\"height: 320px; width: 640px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Amy Skorheim for Engadget</div></figure>\n<p>Wrist flick is a great feature — though it's important to note that Android wearables since WearOS 2 had a similar feature for a while now. And I’d like to see Apple adopt more hands-free interactions like this. Apple already has many gesture-based controls as part of its existing <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/guide/watch/assistivetouch-apdec70bfd2d/watchos\">AssistiveTouch</a> feature. Actions like fist clenches, wrist tilts and single or double taps can control most of the navigation on the watch. Unfortunately, turning on AssistiveTouch turns off the universal double tap feature. I’d be interested in seeing something that splits the difference. Perhaps four or five gestures for basic functions that can be used in conjunction with screen input.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-smarter-replies-could-make-messages-a-usable-watch-app\">Smarter replies could make Messages a usable watch app</h2>\n<p>The Apple Watch is great for reading texts, but replying is awkward. That tiny keyboard is an interface for ants — even talk-to-text input is inefficient as it’s tough to correct mistakes. Smart Replies are little canned responses that appear as suggestions below the reply field. Those aren’t new, but now Series 9 watches and later will use an improved on-device language model to come up with relevant bits of text you can send with a tap.</p>\n<p>In addition to the choices that are always offered — Okay, Yes, No, Thank you and Can I call you later? — I saw things like “Ok, let me know” and “That’s so sweet!” both of which applied to their respective conversations. I wasn’t always given Smart Reply suggestions, and some of them weren’t very relevant, but again, it’s a great feature that will save time when it works.</p>\n<p>Another Messages update is a carryover from iOS 26 (and borrowed from countless other messaging apps). You can now set custom backgrounds for each of your (Apple-only) contacts. Just note that whatever you set will be seen by all participants in the conversation, once they update to iOS 26. On your watch, the photo, gradient or pattern you pick carries over to your conversations. Not only does it look nice, I find backgrounds help me to not accidentally text my mom something I meant to send to my sister.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"You can apply different backgrounds to your conversations in Messages\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-08/b78924f0-76d7-11f0-97a3-d2837d663e80\" style=\"height: 1440px; width: 2560px;\" /><figcaption>Backgrounds are now available in Messages.&nbsp;</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Amy Skorheim for Engadget</div></figure>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-notes-have-arrived\">Notes have arrived</h2>\n<p>The Notes app is now on Apple Watch. I honestly hadn’t noticed the lack before this — I know there are plenty of <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apps/the-only-thing-i-want-from-apples-big-2025-redesign-is-a-120023531.html\">Notes enthusiasts</a> out there, but in my world, Alexa handles all reminder and shopping list duties. Still, I can see how the new integration could come in handy. After creating a simple shopping checklist in the iOS Notes app, I opened the list on my watch while I was shopping and found it far easier to check things off on my wrist than dragging out my phone every time I stuck something in my cart.</p>\n<p>I’m curious to see whether Apple’s improved prediction algorithms for the new OS will eventually add Notes to my Smart Stack suggestions after I open the Notes app a few times at the grocery store. As it stands now, the Notes widget will pop up first in the Smart Stack if that’s the last app you used.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-the-rest-of-the-new-stuff\">The rest of the new stuff</h2>\n<h3 id=\"jump-link-face-gallery\"><strong>Face Gallery</strong></h3>\n<p>The iPhone Watch app has a new look and now organizes watch faces by category instead of by name. Groupings include New, Clean, Data-rich, Photos and Health and Fitness, among others. It’s certainly an improvement, but one that makes you wonder why it wasn’t always like this.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"The Watch Face gallery is categorized now.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-08/b78924f0-76d7-11f0-bfbd-132a621428bd\" style=\"height: 1441px; width: 2560px;\" /><figcaption>The Watch Face gallery is categorized now.</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Amy Skorheim for Engadget</div></figure>\n<h3 id=\"jump-link-adaptive-sound\"><strong>Adaptive sound</strong></h3>\n<p>Another nice-but-obvious update adjusts the volume of pings and beeps to fit the environment — quieter in a noiseless office and louder at a raucous BBQ. I set a timer to go off when I was quietly working at my desk and then again with loud music playing and I couldn’t really tell the difference. But that’s a hard metric for the humble human ear to judge. Again, this is a feature reserved for Series 9 models and later.</p>\n<h3 id=\"jump-link-smart-stack\"><strong>Smart Stack</strong></h3>\n<p>The Smart Stack will now add a small prompt to your watch face when it detects certain situations. For example, if you open the camera app on your phone, a small camera icon appears at the bottom of your watch screen, as a suggestion to open the remote shutter. Apple gives other examples, such as showing the workout icon when you arrive at your usual pilates studio or the <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/guide/watch/use-backtrack-to-retrace-your-steps-apd25bfcec3f/watchos\">Backtrack</a> navigation feature when you journey away from cellular connectivity.</p>\n<p>I didn’t see the prompt very often, but I did notice that the Smart Stack rearranged itself according to my habits — such as putting the medication widget at the top of the stack right around the time it was time to take my prescription, or shuffling Shazam to the top when it hears music playing.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-siri-is-still-siri\">Siri is still Siri</h2>\n<p>Coming fresh off of reviewing the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8, I can’t help but notice a stark difference between that wearable’s fully integrated, AI-powered Gemini and Apple’s same-old Siri. Gemini on the Samsung watch helped me find new stuff in my city, performed convoluted tasks and answered some pretty esoteric questions. I use Siri on my watch to reliably set timers, text people and add events to my calendar. But it’s not quite on the level of Gemini’s contextually-aware, generative capabilities that can interact with multiple apps. Asking something like “Where should I have lunch?” gave me a list of businesses with lunch in the name followed by Siri asking me: “Which one?” Not sure what that meant. Gemini, on the other hand, gave me local and relevant ideas for places I’d actually want to eat.</p>\n<p>Even before AI swallowed everyone’s mind, I had a soft spot for digital assistants. When Alexa sings the “You’re very, very, oh so very welcome” song, I get a dopey smile on my face. I’ve tried to love Siri, but I get frustrated by being misunderstood, misdirected, misheard and flat-out ignored. I know Apple doesn’t like to release new tech until it’s fully up to snuff, and I’m looking forward to seeing what finally happens with new Siri. But for now, the disparity shows.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-wrap-up\">Wrap-up</h2>\n<p>The changes watchOS 26 brings to the Apple Watch are perhaps not as grand as those for other Apple devices. Liquid Glass here isn’t as all-encompassing <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/ios-26-beta-preview-liquid-glass-is-better-than-you-think-172155402.html\">as it is on the iPhone</a>. The new watch features don’t make the wearable finally realize its full potential <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/ipados-26-preview-a-long-awaited-multi-tasking-update-pays-off-so-far-172522054.html\">like iPad OS 26</a> does for the tablet. And there isn’t one major feature upgrade that transforms the watch experience, like <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/macos-26-beta-preview-spotlights-time-to-shine-171700779.html\">macOS 26 does with Spotlight </a>on Macs.</p>\n<p>But the updates do push the experience of using the watch forward. Liquid Glass is pretty and nicely ties the wearable with its companion devices. The Workout app, which was already good at tracking fitness metrics, is even better with the Workout Buddy, providing stat summaries and automated playlists. Improved smart replies for Messages and the addition of the Notes app fix two of the watch’s previous shortcomings. And the wrist flick adds another option for hands-free interaction and — I hope — is a precursor to more such utility. I’m still holding out hope for an improved, personable and helpful Siri once Apple is ready, but for now, these are all welcome upgrades for what’s already the industry’s best overall smartwatch.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/watchos-26-preview-its-the-little-things-140035949.html?src=rss"}

It's a good deal for anyone who wants to take advantage of the Switch 2's camera functionality in games like <em>Mario Kart World</em> and that <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/chillin-by-the-fire-is-a-relaxing-co-op-campfire-sim-thats-out-today-on-nintendo-switch-2-150009762.html\">recently-released campfire sim</a>.</p> \n<p>This was designed specifically for Nintendo's new console, so it's a plug-and-play affair. It's actually cheaper than the official Switch 2 camera with this sale and it looks a whole lot cooler. It's a Piranha Plant from the Mario franchise. We called it a \"work of art\" <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/horis-piranha-plant-switch-2-camera-is-a-work-of-art-194430377.html\">upon encountering the device</a> and that holds true today.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span> \n<p> </p> \n<p>This thing is not only stylish, resembling an Amiibo more than a camera, but it's downright useful. The pot the Piranha Plant sits in functions as both a stand and USB extension for the device. The plant itself detaches from the pot, so the camera can be used in portable mode by popping it into the USB port at the top of the console.</p> \n<p>There's also a built-in privacy shutter. Just close the plant's mouth to obscure the lens. The actual camera specs here aren't going to win any awards, with a frame rate of 30FPS and a resolution of 640 x 480p. However, that's more than enough to capture footage of your floating head to accompany your kart as it races through the Mushroom Kingdom.</p> \n<p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals\"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on X for the latest </em><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/deals/\"><em>tech deals</em></a><em> and </em><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-tech/\"><em>buying advice</em></a><em>.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-hori-piranha-plant-camera-for-nintendo-switch-2-is-on-sale-for-33-percent-off-145031942.html?src=rss"}

After having hundreds of half-filled notebooks over the years, I, at some point, turned to digital tools instead because it was just easier to store everything on my phone or laptop so I always had my most important information at my fingertips.<br /><br />E-Ink tablets seem to provide the best of both worlds: the tactile satisfaction of regular notebooks with many of the conveniences found in digital tools, plus easy-on-the-eyes E-Ink screens. These devices have come a long way in recent years — now you can find them in multiple sizes, some have color E Ink screens and others double as full-blow ereaders with access to ebook stores and your local library’s offerings. I’ve tested out close to a dozen E Ink tablets over the past few years to see how well they work, how convenient they really are and which are the best tablets using E Ink screens available today.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-table-of-contents\">Table of contents</h2> \n<ul> \n <li><p><a href=\"#jump-link-best-e-ink-tablets-for-2025\">Best E Ink tablets for 2025</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"#jump-link-are-e-ink-tablets-worth-it\">Are E Ink tablets worth it?</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"#jump-link-what-to-look-for-in-an-e-ink-tablet\">What to look for in an E Ink tablet</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"#jump-link-other-e-ink-tablets-weve-tested\">Other E Ink tablets we've tested</a></p></li> \n</ul> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-best-e-ink-tablets-for-2025\">Best E Ink tablets for 2025</h2> \n<p> </p> \n<p> </p> \n<p> </p> \n<p> </p> \n<p> </p> \n<p> </p> \n<p> </p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-are-e-ink-tablets-worth-it\">Are E Ink tablets worth it?</h2> \n<p>An E Ink tablet will be a worthwhile purchase to a very select group of people. If you prefer the look and feel of an e paper display to LCD panels found on traditional tablets, it makes a lot of sense. They’re also good options for those who want a more paper-like writing experience (although you can get that kind of functionality on a regular tablet with the right screen protector) or a more distraction-free device overall.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span> \n<p>The final note is key here. Many E Ink tablets don’t run on the same operating systems as regular tablets, so you’re automatically going to be limited in what you can do. And even with those that do allow you to download traditional apps like Chrome, Instagram and Facebook, E Ink tablets are not designed to give you the best casual-browsing experience. This is mostly due to the nature of E Ink displays, which have noticeable refreshes, a lack of vibrant colors and lower picture quality than the panels you’ll find on even the cheapest iPad.</p> \n<p>Arguably the biggest reason why you <em>wouldn’t</em> want to go with an iPad (all models of which support stylus input, a plethora of reading apps, etc) is because it’s much easier to get distracted by email, social media and other Internet-related temptations.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-what-to-look-for-in-an-e-ink-tablet\">What to look for in an E Ink tablet</h2> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-writing-and-latency\">Writing and latency</h3> \n<p>Arguably the most important thing to consider when looking for an E Ink tablet is the writing experience. How good it is will depend a lot on the display’s refresh rate (does it refresh after every time you put pen to “paper,” or at a different regular interval) and the stylus’ latency. Most of the tablets I’ve tested have little to no latency, but some are certainly better than others. Finally, you should double check before buying that your preferred E Ink tablet comes with a stylus, or if you need to purchase one separately.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-reading\">Reading</h3> \n<p>How much will you be reading books, documents and other things on this tablet? E Ink tablets come in many sizes, but most of them tend to be larger than your standard e-reader because it makes writing much easier. Having a larger display isn’t a bad thing, but it might make holding it for long periods slightly more uncomfortable. (Most e-readers are roughly the size of a paperback book, giving you a similar feeling to analog reading).</p> \n<p>The supported file types for e-books can also make a big difference. It’s hard to make a blanket statement here because this varies so much among E Ink tablets. The TL;DR is that you’ll have a much better reading experience if you go with one made by a company that already has a history in e-book sales (i.e. Amazon or Kobo). All of the titles you bought via the<a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/amazons-kindle-scribe-updates-include-support-for-direct-on-page-writing-051753157.html\"> Kindle</a> or Kobo store should automatically be available to you on your Kindle or Kobo E Ink tablet.</p> \n<p>Also with Kindle titles, specifically, since they are protected by DRM, it’s not necessarily the best idea to try to<a href=\"https://www.ebook-converter.com/104-how-to-read-kindle-ebook-kobo.htm\"> bring those titles over to a third-party device</a>. Unless the tablet runs an operating system like Android that supports downloads for apps like Kindle and Kobo, you’ll be limited to supported file types, like ePUB, PDF, MOBI, JPEG, PNG and others.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-search-functionality\">Search functionality</h3> \n<p>Most E Ink tablets have some on-device search features, but they can vary widely between models. You’ll want to consider how important it is to you to be able to search through all your handwritten notes and markups. I noticed in my testing that Amazon’s and Kobo’s E Ink tablets made it easy to refer back to notes made in books and files because they automatically save to the specific pages on which you took notes, made highlights and more.</p> \n<p>Searching is less standardized on E Ink tablets that have different supported file types, but their features can be quite powerful in their own right. For example, a few devices I tested supported text search in handwritten notes along with handwriting recognition, the latter of which allows you to translate your scribbles into typed text.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-sharing-and-connectivity\">Sharing and connectivity</h3> \n<p>While we established that E Ink tablets can be great distraction-free devices, most manufacturers understand that your notes and doodles aren’t created in a vacuum. You may want to access them elsewhere, and that requires some form of connectivity. All of the E Ink tablets I tried have Wi-Fi support, and some support cloud syncing, companion mobile apps and the ability to export notes via email so you can access them elsewhere.</p> \n<p>None of them, however, integrate directly with a digital note taking system like Evernote or OneNote, so these devices will always be somewhat supplementary if you use apps like that, too. I’d argue that, if you already lean heavily on apps like OneNote, a standard tablet with a stylus and screen protector might be the best way to go. Ultimately, you should think about what you will want to do with the documents you’ll interact with on your E Ink tablet <em>after</em> the tablet portion is done.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-price\">Price</h3> \n<p>E Ink tablets aren’t known for being cheap. They generally fall into the $300-$800 price range, which is what you can expect to pay for a solid regular tablet, too. A key factor in price is size: cheaper devices with E Ink displays are likely to have smaller screens, and stylus support isn’t as much of a given. Also, those types of devices are generally considered e-readers because of their size and may not be the best for note-taking, doodling and the like.</p> \n<p>E Ink tablets have gone up in price recently. Supernote and Onyx Boox increased prices, as did reMarkable. The former said it was due to \"increased costs,” and a reMarkable representative confirmed this to Engadget and provided the following statement: \"We regularly review our pricing based on market conditions and operational costs. We've communicated an upcoming adjustment for the US market effective in May to provide transparency to our customers. Multiple factors influence our pricing decisions, including supply chain dynamics and overall operational costs in specific markets.”</p> \n<p>As a result, the reMarkable Paper Pro jumped from $579 to $629 (that's for the bundle with the standard Marker and no Folio). This isn't great, considering the Paper Pro was already on the expensive side of the spectrum for E Ink tablets. It's also worth noting that Supernote and Onyx Boox have raised prices in the past few months as well.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-other-e-ink-tablets-weve-tested\">Other E Ink tablets we've tested</h2> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-lenovo-smart-paper\">Lenovo Smart Paper</h3> \n<p>Lenovo made a solid E Ink tablet in the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/lenovo-smart-paper-review-a-solid-e-ink-tablet-spoiled-by-the-cost-133056534.html\">Smart Paper</a>, but it's too pricey and too married to the company's companion cloud service to warrant a spot on our top picks list. The hardware is great, but the software isn't as flexible as those of competitors like the reMarkable 2. It has good Google Drive integration, but you must pair it with Lenovo's cloud service to really get the most use out of it — and in the UK, the service costs £9 per month for three months, which is quite expensive.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-onyx-boox-tab-ultra\">Onyx Boox Tab Ultra</h3> \n<p>The <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=57f41413-eec2-4d90-9c25-26d144b737b8&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;linkText=Boox+Tab+Ultra&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3Nob3AuYm9veC5jb20vcHJvZHVjdHMvdGFiIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI1N2Y0MTQxMy1lZWMyLTRkOTAtOWMyNS0yNmQxNDRiNzM3YjgiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vc2hvcC5ib294LmNvbS9wcm9kdWN0cy90YWIifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAb7A7EPvy3G8_cwM2BUU4bg4uNsVGQKK3o2yEjUAdhc2&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fshop.boox.com%2Fproducts%2Ftab\">Boox Tab Ultra</a> has a lot of the same features we like in the Note Air 2 Plus, but it’s designed to be a true, all-purpose tablet with an E Ink screen. Running Android 11 and compatible with a magnetic keyboard case, you can use it like a standard 2-in-1 laptop, albeit a low-powered one. You can browse the web, check email and even watch YouTube videos on this thing — but that doesn’t mean you should. A standard 2-in-1 laptop with a more responsive screen and better overall performance would be a better fit for most people who even have the slightest desire to have an all-in-one device. Like the rest of Onyx’s devices, the Tab Ultra is specifically for those who put reading and eye comfort above all else.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/best-e-ink-tablet-130037939.html?src=rss"}

LG decided to carry over its most premium soundbars <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/lg-s95tr-and-sg10ty-first-look-two-takes-on-wireless-dolby-atmos-for-home-theater-154551736.html\">from 2024</a>, but it will add the compact <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/lg-previews-the-compact-s20a-soundbar-at-ces-2025-191337487.html\">S20A</a> this year. The company only previewed the model at CES, so full specs are still forthcoming.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span> \n<p>Samsung will once again keep the same overall design and features for its top-end Q990 soundbar. However, the company is adding a few new tools and it drastically reduced the size of the wireless subwoofer that comes in the box. Samsung does have one new model for 2025, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/samsung-debuts-the-qs700f-soundbar-and-updates-the-q990-at-ces-2025-030042257.html\">the QS700F</a>, that’s designed to sit on a table or automatically adjust to being mounted flat on a wall. Details are scarce on that soundbar for now and I anticipate a full spec sheet when the company is really to sell it.</p> \n<p>Of the big three TV companies, Sony is the only one that didn’t announce any home theater gear at CES. The company has decided to focus mainly on its automotive efforts at the show recently, leaving TV and audio announcements for later in the year. The company debuted <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/sony-debuts-bravia-theater-line-of-dolby-atmos-soundbars-and-speakers-160034176.html\">multiple soundbar options</a> in 2024 and a four-speaker setup for the living room in the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/sony-debuts-bravia-theater-line-of-dolby-atmos-soundbars-and-speakers-160034176.html\">Bravia Quad</a>. That said, it wouldn’t surprise me if Sony released new soundbars later in the year since its most recent models were only announced last April.</p> \n<p>One company I would keep an eye on is Sennheiser. The <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-23-sennheiser-ambeo-soundbar-review.html\">original Ambeo model</a> is nearly six years old and could use a refresh. The company has added <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/sennheiser-ambeo-soundbar-plus-sub-dolby-atmos-170353080.html\">medium</a> and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/sennheiser-ambeo-soundbar-mini-review-excellent-and-expensive-183045244.html\">mini</a> options to the Ambeo lineup since then, but it would be nice to see a refined version of the largest model too. The original Ambeo soundbar is huge, so no matter how good it sounds, it will always be a tough sell for some people.</p> \n<p>Although I think it’s less likely, it’s also possible that Sonos has new soundbars this year. While the company’s next device will likely be the rumored set-top streaming box, the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/what-is-sonos-sound-motion-technology-183313680.html\">Sound Motion tech</a> inside <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/sonos-arc-ultra-review-new-tech-powers-a-big-audio-upgrade-130011149.html\">the Arc Ultra</a> would offer a big improvement to bass performance in compact models like the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/sonos-beam-gen-2-review-dolby-atmos-soundbar-130024506.html\">Beam</a> and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/sonos-ray-soundbar-review-130050814-130050448.html\">Ray</a>. The company may bring Sound Motion to standalone speakers first, but it’s destined for those smaller soundbars <em>eventually</em>.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-the-best-soundbars-for-2025\">The best soundbars for 2025</h2> \n<p> </p> \n<p> </p> \n<p> </p> \n<p> </p> \n<p> </p> \n<p> </p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-\"></h2> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-what-to-look-for-in-a-soundbar\">What to look for in a soundbar</h2> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-features\">Features</h3> \n<p>When it comes to features, the more you pay the more you're going to get in your new audio system. Most affordable options ($150 or less) will improve your television's audio quality, but that's about it. Step into the $300 to $400 range and you'll find all-in-one soundbars with things like built-in voice control, wireless connectivity, Google Chromecast, AirPlay 2 and even Android TV. They're all helpful when you want to avoid looking for the remote control, but the best playback quality is usually only in the top tier and the formats those premium soundbar systems support. I’m talking about things like Dolby Atmos, DTS:X and other high-resolution audio standards — essentials if you’re building a truly cinematic home entertainment setup. And not all Atmos soundbars are equal, so you'll need to look at the finer details carefully before you break into the savings account. If you're looking for one of the best Dolby Atmos soundbars, size, channels and subwoofer options will be important factors to consider. Some models even include a dedicated subwoofer to enhance bass performance, bringing an extra punch to action scenes and soundtracks.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-ports\">Ports</h3> \n<figure> \n <img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/cfb15b20-e904-11eb-9f99-c08983de4f5c\" /> \n <figcaption></figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>This is a big one. A lot of the more affordable soundbars are limited when it comes to connectivity options. They either offer an optical port or one HDMI jack and, if you're lucky, both. Things get slightly better in the mid-range section, but that's not always the case. The Sonos Beam, for example, is $449, but only has a single HDMI port. Even at the higher-end, the $899 Sonos Arc still only has one HDMI port. If you plan to connect multiple devices like a set-top box, gaming laptop or console directly to your soundbar for the best audio experience, you’ll want an option with at least two HDMI (eARC) inputs. HDMI connections are critical for supporting Dolby Atmos and Dolby Digital audio formats, as well as high-res passthrough for HDR and 8K/4K content.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-channels\">Channels</h3> \n<p>Another big thing you’ll want to pay attention to when looking for the best soundbar is channels. That’s the 2.1, 7.1.2 or other decimal number that companies include in product descriptions. The first figure corresponds to the number of channels. A two would just be left and right while a more robust Atmos system, especially one with rear surround speakers, could be five or seven (left, right, center and upward). The second number refers to the dedicated subwoofer, so if your new soundbar comes with one or has them built in, you’ll see one here. The third numeral is up-firing speakers, important for the immersive effect of Dolby Atmos. Not all Atmos-enabled units have them, but if they do, the third number will tell you how many are in play and how they contribute to the overall soundstage.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-wireless\">Wireless</h3> \n<figure> \n <img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/cff960a0-e904-11eb-ad7a-7525dbfffb3a\" /> \n <figcaption></figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Most soundbars these days offer either Bluetooth, Wi-Fi or both. When it comes to Wi-Fi, that connectivity affords you luxuries like voice control (either built-in or with a separate device), Chromecast, Spotify Connect and AirPlay 2. Depending on your preferences, you might be able to live without some of these. For me, AirPlay 2 and Chromecast are essentials, but the rest I can live without. Those two give me the ability to beam music and podcasts from my go-to apps without having to settle for — or struggle with — a Bluetooth connection. For instance, Sonos speakers often offer seamless integration with iOS devices, making it easy to connect and stream music wirelessly. If you’re looking for a wireless speaker that can enhance your TV setup while also offering flexibility for audio throughout the house, it's worth considering a multi-room system.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-size\">Size</h3> \n<p>This one might seem obvious but humor me for a minute. Nothing is more soul-crushing than getting a pricey soundbar in your living room only to discover you have to rearrange everything to find a spot for it. This was my plight when the<a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B08J99R8WJ&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=e0a90d7f-849e-44f0-bc4d-8672c83d006d&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=Sennheiser+Ambeo+Soundbar&amp;custData=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&amp;signature=AQAAATT-eD3Vxikh1Ox2eB9IcdUDMCrEFQYjLWpCtPt27sw-&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSennheiser-AMBEO-Soundbar-5-1-4-Channel%2Fdp%2FB08J99R8WJ\"> Sennheiser Ambeo Soundbar</a> arrived at my door. Yes, that speaker is absurdly large (and heavy), and most soundbars aren't nearly as big. I learned a valuable lesson: Make sure the space where you want to put a soundbar will accommodate the thing you're about to spend hundreds (if not thousands) of dollars on.</p> \n<p>Basically, it all comes down to the TV you have (or are planning to get) and what the primary goal is for your living-room audio. Is it ease of use? Do you want the best possible sound from a single speaker or speaker/sub combo? Do you just want to be able to actually hear your TV better? Or do you want a full home entertainment experience with crisp vocals, thunderous deep bass, and immersive surround system audio?</p> \n<p>By paying attention to each of those areas, you should have a good idea of what to look for in a soundbar, soundbar/subwoofer combo, Dolby Digital system or a more robust setup. With that said, we've put numerous products through their paces at Engadget and have a few favorites for best soundbar at various price points to get you started.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-other-soundbars-we-tested\">Other soundbars we tested</h2> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-sony-bravia-theater-bar-6\">Sony Bravia Theater Bar 6</h3> \n<p>There’s a lot to like about the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/sony-bravia-theater-bar-6-review-great-sound-greater-frustration-144512450.html\">Bravia Theater Bar 6</a>, Sony’s new midrange option in its soundbar lineup. Sound quality is the speaker’s best attribute, even though it’s limited by its 3.1.2-channel configuration. The biggest two issues with this model are the lack of Wi-Fi connectivity — which means no AirPlay, Chromecast or Spotify Connect — and the need to use your computer and a thumb drive to install firmware updates. Neither of those should be things you have to consider on a $650 soundbar in 2025.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-sonos-arc\">Sonos Arc</h3> \n<p>There’s no doubt that <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/sonos-arc-review-dolby-atmos-soundbar-010039560.html\">the Arc</a> is Sonos’ best-sounding soundbar, but it’s also the company’s most expensive. With a new model based on the Arc <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-11-21/sonos-plans-400-500-headphones-tv-set-top-box-video-roam-2-new-sound-bar\">rumored to be on the way</a>, it’s difficult to recommend this product over the likes of Samsung and Sony. The Arc works well as both a soundbar and a speaker, and the device will fit in nicely with other Sonos gear you might already have for a multiroom setup. It only has one HDMI port though, where much of the competition allows you to connect streaming and gaming devices directly to their soundbars.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-sennheiser-ambeo-soundbar-plus\">Sennheiser Ambeo Soundbar Plus</h3> \n<p>I don’t think <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/sennheiser-ambeo-soundbar-plus-sub-dolby-atmos-170353080.html\">Sennheiser’s medium-sized model</a> offers enough to stand out from the more powerful <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-23-sennheiser-ambeo-soundbar-review.html\">Ambeo Soundbar Max</a> or the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/sennheiser-ambeo-soundbar-mini-review-excellent-and-expensive-183045244.html\">Ambeo Soundbar Mini</a>. The Mini is more affordable and does a solid job with immersive audio in its own right. Like the rest of the Ambeo lineup, there’s no option for satellite speakers as you can only add a subwoofer to the soundbars. However, the Ambeo Soundbar Plus does have RCA input, so you can use it with a turntable if you’re into vinyl.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-best-soundbar-faqs\">Best soundbar FAQs</h2> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-is-a-soundbar-better-than-speakers\">Is a soundbar better than speakers?</h3> \n<p>It really depends on what you’re after. A soundbar is definitely a simpler, more compact solution compared to a full speaker setup. If you want better sound than your TV’s built-in setup but don’t want to deal with multiple speakers and wires everywhere, a soundbar is probably the way to go. Some soundbars can even deliver impressive surround sound effects, thanks to features like Dolby Atmos and virtual audio technology.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>However, if you’re an audiophile or want true surround sound for an at-home theater experience, a multi-speaker setup with a receiver, surround speakers and subwoofer will give you a richer soundstage and more control over your experience.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-what-connection-do-i-need-for-a-soundbar\">What connection do I need for a soundbar?</h3> \n<p>Most modern soundbars connect to your TV via HDMI ARC or eARC, which is the easiest and best option for achieving high-quality audio. If your TV supports this, all you need is an HDMI cable, and you’ll get not only great sound but also some extra features like controlling the soundbar with your TV remote.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>If HDMI ARC isn’t an option on your TV, you can use an optical cable, which also delivers solid audio quality. Some soundbars even offer Bluetooth or Wi-Fi connections for streaming music, and a few still have a 3.5mm aux jack for connecting to older devices.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-do-all-soundbars-come-with-subwoofers\">Do all soundbars come with subwoofers?</h3> \n<p>Not all soundbars come with subwoofers, but many do or at least offer one as an optional add-on that you can purchase separately. A subwoofer is what gives you that deep, booming bass, so if you like action movies or want a fuller sound for music, having one can make a big difference. Some soundbars have a built-in subwoofer, but these generally don’t provide the same punch as a separate one.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/best-soundbars-143041791.html?src=rss"}

For this software, decentralization and — most specifically decentralized governance — will be a core feature; and it is this decentralization that allows community members to contribute to the larger social, cultural and financial ecosystem growing around any software protocol.</p><p>With respect to the Aave Protocol, the community has indicated that it would like to see the protocol deployed to networks other than Ethereum, such as Polygon. Because this is a community-based desire and because the Aave Protocol is controlled by the community through Ethereum-based Aave Governance, the community should also be able to use the Aave Governance with any non-Ethereum networks.</p><p>Introducing Aave Governance cross-chain bridges — a unique set of tools to enable true cross-chain governance on Ethereum — that the Aave community can consider adopting. An explanation of this new software is below, along with an announcement about the open-sourcing and decentralizing of the Aave user interface, for anybody to contribute and run to access the protocol.</p><h3>Architecture of the Cross-Chain Bridge</h3><p>Let’s have a quick dive in the Aave Governance architecture — and how it can be extended to bridge its decisions affecting non-Ethereum based deployment of the protocol.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*M7GLeob59mInf08D4VIbFw.png\" /><figcaption>A scheme of the Aave Governance architecture</figcaption></figure><p>For any governance proposal, the key components of the Aave Governance architecture are:</p><ul><li>The main governance contract, which allows users to create proposals and allows AAVE holders to vote on those proposals; as well as</li><li>The executor contracts, which implement and execute any proposal approved by AAVE holders through a time-lock (the time period of which varies based upon the particular proposal) and defines the parameters by which each specific proposal is implemented (if approved).</li></ul><p>However, when any instance of the protocol is deployed on a network other than Ethereum, the only way in which a decision taken by the Ethereum-based governance can be applied is through a bridge from Ethereum to that network. Specifically, if Aave Governance’s decisions were to be applied to the Polygon instance of the Aave Protocol, then the community would have to put forth and implement cross-chain proposals. This would occur through a Bridge Executor Contract.</p><p>The process is the following:</p><ul><li>On the Ethereum side, the system receives the proposal data from the Aave Governance executors on the smart contract initiating the bridging.</li><li>On the recipient chain side, the system receives the already bridged proposal data, forwarded by the Ethereum side.</li><li>Finally, the proposal is executed on the recipient chain after an additional time-lock window.</li></ul><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*WCW7XFLbLAFK28e50zkziQ.png\" /><figcaption>Diagram of the cross-chain governance architecture for the Polygon case</figcaption></figure><p>Going deeper into the technical details, to submit a proposal regarding the Aave Polygon Market, proposers on Ethereum can encode the proposal to interact with the Polygon FxRoot bridge. The bridge will forward the proposal data to the FxChild on the Polygon side that will queue the proposal in the Polygon Bridge Executor, which will allow to finally execute it after an additional time-lock window.</p><p>This model is not only limited to Polygon, but can be extended to almost any other chain associated with a bridging engine allowing arbitrary messages communication. It’s possible to see a proof of concept of this applied to a roll-up L2 chain like Arbitrum on the same repository, with the architecture explained in the following diagram.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*BioFIqiM7S0-0xGxJ-StVg.png\" /><figcaption>Diagram of the cross-chain governance architecture for a potential Arbitrum case</figcaption></figure><p>Prior to Aave Governance receiving full control over the Aave Protocol instance on Polygon via the Bridge Executor, a test proposal has been posted to Aave Governance <a href=\"https://app.aave.com/governance/29-QmaVRJEWEbik6kcDQSpVvgVM9DLUciNJ9BJAUKp9LwK6iW\">here</a>, to verify that the Aave Governance approves how the system works as expected between Ethereum Mainnet and Polygon Mainnet. Once this test is successful, then the Aave Governance will be given complete control of the Aave Polygon market.</p><p>The codebase for the Cross-chain Bridges, including extensive documentation is available <a href=\"https://github.com/aave/governance-crosschain-bridges\">here</a>. This will allow anyone to use the code to build their own cross-chain bridges for any chain that needs decisions from another.</p><p>The bridges have been audited by <a href=\"https://mixbytes.io/\">MixBytes</a>, and the report of the audit is available <a href=\"https://github.com/aave/governance-crosschain-bridges/blob/5c92f459c2e647816725be20fb3902bcef2ddca1/audit/Aave-Governance-Crosschain-Bridges-Security-Audit-Report.pdf\">here</a>. The Bug Bounty program applies as well, you can find all the details <a href=\"https://aave.com/bug-bounty\">here</a>.</p><h3>Open Sourcing the Aave Frontend</h3><p>In addition, today the codebase of one of the front-end interfaces to the Aave Protocol is being open sourced — that means that the code will be available to anyone and may be distributed and modified (subject to the terms of the license, discussed below).</p><p>The specific repositories being open sourced are:</p><ul><li><strong>Aave UI</strong>. Main front-end repository, located <a href=\"https://github.com/aave/aave-ui\">here</a>.</li><li><strong>UI caching server</strong>. Convenience server to optimize interactions with Ethereum nodes’ providers, located <a href=\"https://github.com/aave/aave-ui-caching-server\">here</a>.</li><li><strong>Aave UI kit</strong>. Visual component used across the Aave UI, located <a href=\"https://github.com/aave/aave-ui-kit\">here</a>.</li></ul><p>Open sourcing the front end will allow for additional inroads to the already-decentralized Aave Protocol. Such interfaces will augment the more-than-100 integrations that already provide access to the Aave Protocol, by allowing anyone to build an alternative front-end with a different or enhanced user experience. Open sourcing the code also will allow anyone to contribute and improve the current Aave UI.</p><p>A robust, community-driven ecosystem is paramount to the ethos of decentralization at the core of DeFi software development, that is why the Aave UI is open sourced under the<a href=\"https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause\"> 3-Clause BSD License</a>.</p><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=ad9dd632175d\" width=\"1\" /><hr /><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/aave/cross-chain-governance-and-open-sourcing-the-aave-ui-ad9dd632175d\">Cross-chain governance and open-sourcing the Aave UI</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/aave\">Aave Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>"}

Now, it’s time for the Aave Protocol to enter the scalability phase and bring decentralised finance back into everyone’s hands, even those with 3 figure portfolios.</p><h4>Focus on Ethereum</h4><p>Aave was born and raised on Ethereum L1, and the Ethereum community was a huge catalyst for the development of the protocol and growth of the Aave Community. Ethereum and the EVM is the center of gravity for DeFi, and no other network comes close to Ethereum’s network effect. However, on a public blockchain, having a slot on a block is defined by supply and demand.</p><p>Block space supply today is scarce and limited, and since the “DeFi Summer” of 2020, demand for using Ethereum and DeFi has never slowed down.</p><p>High transaction fees are a feature of a successful public blockchain, as they define actors ready to pay the market price to use the decentralised services.</p><p>That being said, DeFi was always intended to create a sustainable and more inclusive alternative to traditional finance. If DeFi is great but only limited to certain high networth users, DeFi will fall short of its mission to be finance for <em>everyone</em>.</p><h4>Multi-Market Approach, ETH L1 as a Settlement layer</h4><p>The solution is on the side of scalability layers of Ethereum:</p><p>Sidechains, rollups, and zero-knowledge-based solutions are quite complex, but fortunately for us, the role of engineers is to make great technology well implemented and intuitive so that complex stuff becomes <em>invisible to untrained eyes</em> just like the Aave mascot<em>.</em></p><p>The Aave Protocol has a multi-market approach and will implement it to scalability solutions in a “New Frontiers” exploration. One of the main assets of DeFi is the ability to build synergies with other projects, and by having an Aave Market in all the venues that matter, there’s no need for a “winner-takes-all” scalability solution and users can choose the solution they feel comfortable with.</p><p>The freedom of choice is earned by a technological victory. In all sidechains that matter, the EVM from Ethereum is the standard of doing smart-contract applications. Replication and deployment of Ethereum L1 code is mostly a seamless process.</p><h4>The First Wave: Sidechains with Polygon</h4><p>The first implementation of the exploration of New Frontiers will be with <a href=\"https://polygon.technology/\">Polygon</a> (<em>formerly known as MATIC). </em>This scalable sidechain of Ethereum allows fast and nearly-free transactions, and Polygon has a nascent ecosystem of applications such as community favourite <a href=\"https://aavegotchi.com/\">Aavegotchi</a> and decentralised exchange <a href=\"https://quickswap.exchange/#/swap\">Quickswap</a>.</p><p>Polygon is also a network powered by <a href=\"https://chain.link/\">Chainlink</a>, allowing the Aave Protocol to maintain the highest standard of safety for the protocol price feeds.</p><p>New frontiers are also an opportunity to taste the local delicacies!</p><p>If the deployment market starts with a limited set of collaterals, being in Polygon is the opportunity for the Aave community to onboard new kinds of collaterals that would be a natural fit in these Networks.</p><p>The Aave Market on Polygon is an opportunity to welcome the MATIC asset as collateral, for example.</p><p>At launch the following assets will be onboarded on the Polygon Aave Market :</p><ul><li>MATIC</li><li>USDC</li><li>USDT</li><li>DAI</li><li>WETH</li><li>AAVE</li><li>WBTC</li></ul><p>To make the experience seamless for the pioneers willing to explore this new frontier with us, a smart-contract bridge will soon be available to bring your favourite assets to Polygon. Users of the bridge will receive part of the transaction fee used in MATIC tokens to cover most of their transaction fees on the Polygon blockchain.</p><p>Meanwhile, the <a href=\"https://wallet.matic.network/bridge/\">Polygon Bridge is available</a> to transfer assets from Ethereum to Polygon</p><p>Thanks to the integration of EIP-3085, switching from Ethereum to the Polygon network is as easy as one-click for every Metamask user, just add the Polygon network when your Metamask Pop-up appears and confirm.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/811/0*Ss0I7fIbrrio0GrQ\" /></figure><p>if you’re not using Metamask, please refers to the official <a href=\"https://docs.matic.network/docs/develop/network-details/network/\">Polygon network documentation</a> to set-up your network RPC</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/801/0*aQwW3pLShHqsaIO2\" /></figure><p>While depositing into Aave on Polygon, you might see a “0.00$” gas fee reference in Metamask.<br />It’s because Metamask User interface doesn’t show transactions that cost below 0.01$ and Polygon is multiple times cheaper to use than this threshold.</p><p>Here’s an indicative cost of Aave Protocol interactions, please note that these costs might change in the future with potential network congestion and MATIC asset valuation.</p><ul><li>Deposit AAVE : $0.000061</li><li>Borrow USDC : $0.000102</li><li>Withdraw AAVE : $0.000109</li><li>Repay USDC : $0.000072</li></ul><p>Aave has also integrated with <a href=\"https://transak.com/\"><strong>Transak</strong></a> to enable the direct purchase of Polygon assets with fiat currencies.</p><p>Feel free to join the Aave fam on<a href=\"https://twitter.com/AaveAave\"> <strong>Twitter</strong></a> or<a href=\"https://aave.com/discord\"> <strong>Discord</strong></a>!</p><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=59563ddd2405\" width=\"1\" /><hr /><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/aave/exploring-new-frontiers-with-aave-59563ddd2405\">Exploring New Frontiers with Aave</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/aave\">Aave Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>"}

The new AMM Liquidity Pool enables liquidity providers (“LPs”) of Uniswap and Balancer to use their LP tokens as collateral in the Aave Protocol.</p><h4>The Rise of AMMs</h4><p>With the rise of Uniswap in 2018 and the emergence of “Automated Market Makers” (AMMs) in the DeFi ecosystem, users of Ethereum are now able to swap assets without the need for centralised third-party intermediaries. Users are able to facilitate the provision of liquidity and earn fees for doing so.</p><h4>How do LP tokens work?</h4><p>By providing liquidity, users automatically obtain LP tokens from the AMM. In most cases, LP tokens represent the crypto assets the user deposited into the AMM along with a proportional scale of the trading fees collected over time in the particular liquidity pool into which the user deposited assets. (Frequently, the LP token represents a 50/50 ratio with ETH and another crypto asset, making them potentially less volatile than their underlying assets.) Because LP tokens typically accrue trading fees over the time the user’s assets remain in the liquidity pool, the LP tokens potentially accrue value over time as well.</p><p>AMMs were one of the first ways to earn a passive income in the DeFi ecosystem and remain so today.</p><h4>A first successful Proof of Concept</h4><p>Last year, the Aave Protocol developed an “AMM Liquidity Pool” proof of concept with the “<a href=\"https://medium.com/aave/the-uniswap-market-is-live-on-aave-protocol-12b5a4cc5e2?source=false---------0\">Aave Uniswap V1 Market</a>,” which allowed users to deposit Uniswap v1 LP tokens in the Aave Protocol and use them as collateral. Given the community’s interest in this pool, users will now be able to use LP tokens from several AMMs, with proposals and decisions from Aave Governance about which AMM protocols and collateral to add.</p><p><strong>The Multi-Market Approach</strong></p><p>The AMM Market is the first of many markets of Aave, on Ethereum, and potentially also on different networks, allowing the community to explore “new frontiers” with Aave.</p><h4>Launch Collaterals and Protocol Support Phase 1:</h4><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/440/0*gnab_VhYa_nt_eZm\" /></figure><p>Today, users will be able to begin depositing LP tokens from both Uniswap v2 and Balancer.</p><p>Uniswap is the center of gravity of AMM protocols. Its robust, simple code and innovative model inspired actors across several blockchains.</p><p>Uniswap has significant daily volume and $4B of liquidity.</p><p>At launch the following Uniswap V2 LP tokens are supported:</p><ul><li>DAI/USDC</li><li>WBTC/USDC</li><li>DAI/WETH</li><li>USDC/WETH</li><li>AAVE/WETH</li><li>LINK/WETH</li><li>BAT/WETH</li><li>SNX/WETH</li><li>UNI/WETH</li><li>YFI/WETH</li><li>CRV/WETH</li><li>MKR/WETH</li><li>REN/WETH</li><li>WBTC/WETH</li></ul><p>Balancer is one of the most innovative AMMs in the ecosystem. Their smart pool system broke the 50/50 ratio status quo and allowed for more sophisticated liquidity pools.</p><p>There are significant synergies between Balancer and the Aave Protocol. Balancer co-hosts art of the Aave Safety Module protecting Aave liquidity providers.</p><p>In addition, based on the smart pool architecture, Balancer LP token holders will continue to earn BAL rewards each week.</p><p>At launch the following Balancer LP tokens (BPT) are supported:</p><ul><li>WBTC/WETH</li><li>BAL/WETH</li></ul><p>At this time, users who deposit LP tokens may borrow the following crypto assets: <strong>DAI, USDC, ETH, wBTC.</strong> and <strong>USDT</strong>. Users who deposit DAI, USDC, ETH and wBTC may borrow tokens.</p><p>To give an accurate estimation of the value of the LPs tokens from both Uniswap &amp; Balancer, the Aave Protocol leverages Chainlink’s decentralised oracle service. The smart-contract to calculate the value of the LP tokens has been <a href=\"https://consensys.net/diligence/audits/2020/08/aave-balancer-and-uniswap-v2-price-providers/\">audited</a> by ConsenSys Diligence.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/651/0*eqHgjTTpu2CHBwRh\" /></figure><h4>Launch Collaterals and Protocol Support Phase 2:</h4><p>As noted above, it will be possible to deploy additional AMM liquidity pools over time, particularly upon proposals from Aave Governance — and such pools will be deployed in a second phase (coming soon). The AMM liquidity pools will be released to Aave Governance in full in short order.</p><p>The AMM Liquidity Pools will not be covered by the Aave Safety Module at launch, but Aave Governance can decide to include these pools through the AIP process.</p><h4>The Aave community will decide on the following steps</h4><p>The Aave Protocol is decentralised and owned by its community of AAVE token holders (referred to as “Aave Governance”). For the support of new collaterals and new AMM protocols, feel free to make proposals in the<a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/\"> governance forum</a> and contact your community representative to whom you delegated your votes.</p><p>We can’t wait to see the AMM Liquidity Pools bloom with your input.</p><p>In DeFi there are no Aave users and there are no AMMs users.</p><p>There are only DeFi users.</p><p>Feel free to join the Aave fam on<a href=\"https://twitter.com/AaveAave\"> <strong>Twitter</strong></a> or<a href=\"https://aave.com/discord\"> <strong>Discord</strong></a>!</p><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=73ae76a7cbc0\" width=\"1\" /><hr /><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/aave/aave-amm-market-released-73ae76a7cbc0\">Aave AMM Market Released</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/aave\">Aave Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>"}

Like our TVL, our ideas kept growing with new features for Aave users. The addition of these new features would require more workable space in the user interface.</p><p>The design team decided to overhaul the layout of the user interface. In V1, the main navigation was on the left side which interacts with the ‘content area’ on the right side. This seemed to work fine for V1. However, with the release of V2 and additional features such as staking, governance, yield &amp; collateral swaps, repay with collateral, credit delegation, stable and variable borrowing, and many more to come, it was clear that V2 needed a change of layout to accommodate all these new features. Additionally, preparing for future scalability is always important, especially in a space that innovates as rapidly as DeFi.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/248/1*ZFoeTyvpkmpx0dozu7n7Qg@2x.jpeg\" /><figcaption>V2 Colour Palette</figcaption></figure><p>After conducting research about dark and light mode for the UI, the design team settled on a “hybrid” combination between light and dark mode solution for the default V2 colour scheme. After the initial release of V2, more colour themes will be released and users will be able to select and set their preference. These colour schemes will be: default, dark mode, and light V1 Aave. For the fans missing the flashy purple/blue colour all over the UI, no need to worry — it will be an option for the theme!</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*BtiqXyHBTnWLLEdEn9P3aw.jpeg\" /><figcaption>Layout</figcaption></figure><p>The design team tried different approaches and decided to go for a more ‘classic’ approach with the ‘menu’ in the top/header bar. This is to accommodate for the space needed for the new features and a dropdown for sub-sections within categories.</p><p>Underneath the menu is the user information/data specifically for that view. For example, when a user is in the ‘dashboard’ they would see the ‘deposits’, ‘collateral’, ‘health factor’ and more metrics, all accompanied by nice visual representations like various pie charts.</p><p>Located under this ‘user information’ area is the ‘content/action’ area. In this area the user will need to take actions such as entering the amount to deposit or selecting which type of APR they prefer when borrowing.</p><p>This new layout adjusts for more flexibility and scalability in the future while giving users the information they need in a very clear and understandable way.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*8kHajZHCNItohJ3G2NA5Nw.png\" /><figcaption>Dashboard</figcaption></figure><p>The user dashboard gets an upgrade as well. No need to switch between ‘deposits’ and ‘borrow’, everything is seamlessly connected in one overview giving the user a birds’ eye view of what is happening with their deposits and borrows. In the future, the ‘dashboard’ view will be expanded to include more metrics.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*gjazJjLTdFZxXkxtGevzhw.png\" /></figure><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*MoQeamM73dkunnSvJMtYrw.png\" /></figure><p>On some views, like the dashboard for example, there is now a clever way to collapse and expand the information area for the user who needs some more space if they are on smaller devices such as 10 inch screens, mobile phones, or for those who just want a less data-heavy view.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*RO1nYM7z6HalBnpjuB1tYg.png\" /><figcaption>Deposit view</figcaption></figure><p>The deposit and borrow main views have been updated as well. The separation between what a user deposited and borrowed previously and what they can deposit/borrow is made clearer in the layout. On the left you will see a list of available assets to deposit/borrow and on the right in the square card you will find your current deposit/borrow positions.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/478/1*e42zewn02bV6-4A3CMt8jw.png\" /><figcaption>AAVE Token balance</figcaption></figure><p>Another nice upgrade in the new V2 layout is the visibility of the AAVE governance token balance. This will always be visible for the user from every view. The balance is an aggregation composed of 3 AAVE balances: AAVE in your wallet, AAVE deposited in the protocol, and AAVE that you’ve staked in the Safety Module.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/284/1*6C0LM3oPMjph48cxmfVf6g.png\" /><figcaption>Markets</figcaption></figure><p>In the same corner there is the dropdown for the ‘markets’. The initial V2 release includes only the default Aave Market, but additional markets will be added soon. Version 1 can be selected from the ‘markets’ dropdown and will take the user directly to the V1 interface. Switching from V1 to V2 while a user is inside the DApp will be done via the same ‘markets’ dropdown. The logic behind this is that V2 is essentially another market.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/876/1*c_vSp9nB-GsT7apOSoKowQ.png\" /><figcaption>Your helpful ghost guide</figcaption></figure><p>The ghost mascot you all know and love will help users onboard and navigate through the Aave Protocol! He’ll be giving hints, notifications, and important messages for users in need of a bit of help.</p><p>These are the main design updates for the initial V2 release, and more will follow in the coming weeks. The design team will constantly work to improve the UI and UX to make DeFi as accessible and seamless as possible!</p><p>DISCLAIMER: Be advised that all the data used in this blog post is not based on fact, but fiction.

The V1 → V2 migration tool has not even been released yet (Soon™), so this growth is particularly Aavesome.</p><p>Last week, there was a governance vote on <a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/aip-4-activation-of-aave-protocol-governance-v2/1749/2\"><strong>AIP-4</strong></a>, a proposal to activate Aave V2 governance. The votes were validated over the weekend, and today it’s time for the next milestone on the decentralisation journey:</p><p>The release of V2 governance!</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/934/1*9icpDRs7T20JAUXKk-fLBA.png\" /></figure><p>With V1 governance, only the Aave Genesis Team could submit Aave Improvement Proposals (AIPs). AIPs are binding on-chain governance proposals that require some technical knowledge and automatically execute once the votes are in and validated. Today, any Aave community actor that meets the requirements can create an AIP to add a new token to the protocol, update risk parameters, add a new liquidity market, and more! V2 governance aims to be inclusive of everyone with a stake in the Aave ecosystem and preserve decentralisation and security.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*bf0LGxLBMP14DPSuC5IedQ.png\" /><figcaption>Aave V2 Governance</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Segregation between proposition and voting power</strong></p><p>AAVE and stkAAVE holders are not only able to create proposals themselves with V2 governance, but also delegate this proposal creation power to another actor! You’ve probably already heard that vote delegation would be a thing in V2, but one of the most innovative mechanisms of V2 governance is that AAVE holders can separately delegate their proposal power and voting power. This means that they now have the choice to delegate their proposal power to another specialised actor while keeping their voting rights, or even delegating them to someone else like a “protocol politician”.</p><p>This makes the governance more scalable, as the ability to assess and vote on a proposal requires different knowledge/skills than those needed to create an AIP. For example, since AIPs require some technical knowledge, a non-technical AAVE holder could delegate their proposition power to someone technical while keeping their right to vote on the AIPs.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/906/1*MpB6Ut9PohDmAb3IHmEI3g@2x.jpeg\" /><figcaption>Vote delegation overview</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Voting strategies upgraded</strong></p><p>With different AAVE token forms comes different voting strategies! In V2 governance, both AAVE and stkAAVE holders have voting rights, so staking will not be a hurdle for participating in the governance. These voting strategies can be updated through governance proposals to include more forms of AAVE (i.e. aAAVE, staked AAVE/ETH AMM shares, etc.)</p><p><strong>Multiple executors bring security</strong></p><p>Different updates and parts of the Aave ecosystem may have different consensus and security needs. For example, changing the logic of the AAVE token is something that could have a huge impact on the ecosystem and must be treated with greater care. Thus, there will be 2 executors for V2 governance: 1 with a short execution delay (timelock) and 1 with a long timelock. The timelock is there to act as a buffer to ensure the security of the protocol.</p><ul><li>Executor 1 (short timelock) will control the Aave Protocol V1 and V2 Risk Parameters, the token distributor for V2, contract collecting fees for V1, the AAVE Reserve Ecosystem, and changes to this timelock itself.</li><li>Executor 2 (long timelock) will control changes to the AAVE and stkAAVE tokens, updates to V2 governance parameters, and any changes to this timelock itself.</li></ul><p><strong>The guardian for extra protection</strong></p><p>If most governance tokens are stored on centralised exchanges, it would be possible for a governance attack to occur where a centralised entity uses its users’ AAVE tokens to take over the governance proposals and voting. To prevent this, V2 governance brings in “the guardian”, a 5/10 multisig with veto power in case malicious code is introduced in an AIP.</p><p>The Guardians have been chosen from the Aave community, and they can be changed later through elections.</p><p>Current Guardians are: James Vaugh (Fire Eyes/Metacartel), Anthony Sassano (SET protocol/ETHhub/Daily Gwei), Mariano Conti (ex MakerDAO head of smart contracts), Tarun Chitra (Gauntlet), DeFiSaver, Zerion, Parafi Capital, Framework Venture, Arthur0x and the Aave Genesis Team.</p><p>For an overview of the V2 governance mechanisms:</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*1nSVfa_du4uy2PZM\" /></figure><p><strong>That’s all folks!</strong></p><p>This important step towards decentralisation means that community members can also create AIPs and vote, and delegate both powers to actors of their choice, making the Aave ecosystem a liquid democracy with many avenues for people to participate. Now more than ever, the protocol is truly in the hands of the community.</p><p>Your feedback is the best asset, and it is always welcome! Looking to take the first steps to get more involved?

As with any other software system, some parts of the infrastructure are critical. The Aave governance has the objective of controlling all the different parts of the ecosystem, and taking into account the aforementioned, permissions over contracts are split between 2 different smart contracts, with different configurations. The first (Executor with long timelock) has control over pieces with low frequency of interaction, like the AAVE governance token or the StkAAVE of the Safety Module. The second (Executor with short timelock) has control over pieces with higher frequency of interaction, like the Aave Protocol v1 and v2. Having a longer timelock on changes concerning tokens, and in general longer time-configurations is usually a good practice security-wise, as it leads to longer reaction window for any external party integrating the tokens.</p><p>2. The design goals of this Governance V2 were simplicity, by following industry standard practices; and innovation, by introducing delegation of proposition power in both the AAVE and StkAAVE.</p><p>3. There is a guardian role with permissions to cancel proposals in order to have a safe-guard against malicious ones. This role will be on a multi-signature wallet with 5-of-10 signatures needed.</p><p>4. All of the changes proposed have been audited by industry security leaders and usual collaborators of AAVE, in this case PeckShield and Certora.</p><p>If the community considers it appropriate, the next steps will be the deployment of the necessary smart contracts in the Ethereum main network, and the creation of the proposal on the Aave Governance v1 to proceed with the upgrade to v2.</p><h3>Aave Protocol V2</h3><p>One week has passed since the release of the Aave Protocol v2, and we are proud that there haven’t been any incidents. However, the following potential attack vector has been discovered and fixed during these first days.</p><p>On Friday, 4 December 2020, 19:18 UTC, the Aave team received a notification from the security researcher Josselin Feist from Trail of Bits reporting the following issue:</p><p>There was a possible attack vector in the Aave Protocol v2 that had the potential to cause a smart contracts Denial-of-Service attack on the protocol that could impact the state of the protocol, other protocols integrating Aave and users. The vulnerability is the following:</p><p>The implementation contract of the <strong>LendingPool</strong> proxy was not correctly initialized at that moment, and because of a connection with another <strong>LendingPoolCollateralManager</strong> contract, via DELEGATECALL, it would be possible for an attacker to provoke a selfdestruction of the implementation logic, leaving the system temporarily not operative until a new implementation is set.</p><p>Even if this doesn’t involve any loss of funds, which is the most critical scenario in a protocol like Aave, the potential consequences are considered high according to our standards.</p><p>As it can be seen <a href=\"https://github.com/aave/protocol-v2/blob/eea6d38f243b909fc3cf82a581c45b8bc3d2390e/contracts/protocol/lendingpool/LendingPool.sol#L46\">here</a>, the <em>LendingPool</em> contract uses a DELEGATECALL proxy pattern, meaning that users interact with the proxy, while the code executed is on the implementation.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/648/1*30t64nja0clgwQ0xxaTyiQ.png\" /><figcaption>Proxy pattern used on Aave</figcaption></figure><p>This implementation contract contains an <em>initialize</em> function, which sets the addresses provider address (<em>_addressesProvider</em> <a href=\"https://github.com/aave/protocol-v2/blob/eea6d38f243b909fc3cf82a581c45b8bc3d2390e/contracts/protocol/lendingpool/LendingPool.sol#L90-L92\">here</a>), and can only be called if the initializer function modifier does not revert. The conditions are:</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/632/1*KD8p8iqUAgQRj1rhr5pMKg.png\" /><figcaption>conditions to call the initialize function</figcaption></figure><p>On the running system on Friday, even if everything was correctly configured on the proxy contract, it was not the same case on the logic contract itself:</p><ul><li><em>revision</em> on the implementation was 2</li><li><em>lastInitializedRevision</em> was 0</li></ul><p>So, the require was passed and anyone could call on the LendingPool implementation <em>initialize</em> and set the <em>_addressesProvider</em> <strong>on the storage of the implementation contract</strong>. This malicious contract would return a <em>LendingPoolCollateralManager</em> address from <em>_addressesProvider.getLendingPoolCollateralManager()</em> containing also malicious code.</p><p>After that, the attacker would call the <em>liquidationCall</em> function <strong>on the LendingPool implementation</strong>. As the state here is completely different to the one in the proxy (the real state of the system), nothing on the protocol can be affected, but if the <em>liquidationCall</em> function in the malicious returned <em>LendingPoolCollateralManager</em> does a <em>selfdestruct</em>, this will destroy the <em>LendingPool</em> implementation contract, as a DELEGATECALL is used.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/633/1*e8IaZ9mo5YjchIjdshEDJA.png\" /><figcaption>The DELEGATECALL that would cause the self-destruct</figcaption></figure><p>Initially, it could appear that when a proxy contract calls as implementation an address without code (remember that the code was self-destructed in the previous step), the transaction would just revert. But this is not actually the case on the used OpenZeppelin proxy contract, as the proxy lacks an existence check on its <a href=\"https://github.com/aave/aave-protocol/blob/e8d020e9752fbd4807a3b55f9cf98a88dcfb674d/contracts/libraries/openzeppelin-upgradeability/Proxy.sol#L30-L54\">fallback function</a>. This means that if the proxy does a <em>DELEGATECALL</em> on an implementation address with no code, the proxy will return success, but no actual code is executed. And this is where the Denial-of-Service appears: anybody calling the <em>LendingPool</em> legitimately would have his transaction succeeded, but without any state change in the protocol.</p><p>As soon as the Aave team received the report from Josselin, we suspected that due to the “obscure” nature of the vulnerability, it could also probably affect v1 of the protocol. Also, we knew that the solution would be easy and fast to execute, just by calling the <em>initialize</em> function in the <em>LendingPool</em> of both protocols with the correct/current <em>_addressesProvider</em>, blocking any further attack opportunity.</p><p>We also immediately realised that, even if we use the proxy pattern extensively, the only vulnerable place was the Aave Protocol itself, because the attack vector only appears in presence of a <em>DELEGATECALL</em> to another contract.</p><p>A high-level recap of our steps were:</p><ul><li><strong>7:18 PM UTC</strong> The team receives the vulnerability report from Josselin, immediately 3 members of the Aave team initiate the internal discussion involving Josselin on the next steps</li><li><strong>7:34 PM UTC</strong> We call <em>initialize</em> in the v1 <em>LendingPool</em>, the most critical system <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/tx/0x98089120cd9b1a83a8c5233f6773ff9c12b7451a12532b7ef103d0a85419aa4e\">https://etherscan.io/tx/0x98089120cd9b1a83a8c5233f6773ff9c12b7451a12532b7ef103d0a85419aa4e</a></li><li><strong>7:53 PM UTC</strong> We call <em>initialize</em> in the v2 <em>LendingPool</em>, <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/tx/0x5e7b4c263d3f764583bd9fbd39bd7276295f033bf42bbcd97bc0e4d8f7d22ed2\">https://etherscan.io/tx/0x5e7b4c263d3f764583bd9fbd39bd7276295f033bf42bbcd97bc0e4d8f7d22ed2</a></li><li><strong>8:13 PM UTC</strong> We call <em>initialize</em> in the v1 Uniswap <em>LendingPool</em> <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/tx/0x714d19c1057de00921836a9edbb24319f3ff64e4499bf80c6f86bdf57cbe852b\">https://etherscan.io/tx/0x714d19c1057de00921836a9edbb24319f3ff64e4499bf80c6f86bdf57cbe852b</a></li></ul><p>With all the main systems fully protected, we deeply reviewed all of our other contracts deployed in main, but as for our initial thoughts, nothing was affected.</p><h4>Consequences of a hypothetical attack</h4><p>As previously described, the attack would be a Denial-of-Service involving Ethereum smart contracts, and because of their particular nature, the criticality is usually higher than in a “traditional” DoS.<br />Taking into account the reaction time of the Aave team, a hypothetical attack would have a margin of time to generate profit/damage in a range of minutes/hours, and could be as following:</p><ul><li>The attacker executes the exploit on both v1 and v2 LendingPool contracts.</li><li>At this point, the points of further exploit are:</li><li>Just stopping the service of the protocol, creating some loss of state affecting all users interacting with during the attack timeframe, that later on would need to be reconstructed from the inputs.<br />- Temporary block ETH funds of users doing new <em>deposits()</em> in the <em>LendingPool</em>, as the ETH would be transferred and the <em>deposit()</em> function would still succeed. The balance of these users would need to be modified according to their deposits later on.<br />- Block all the extraction of funds from the protocol, as no code would allow for transfers out.<br />- In the case of Aave v2, due to the usage of a <em>WETHGateway</em> contract to allow people holding ETH to deposit WETH, an attack vector could appear stealing funds of users trying to deposit WETH during the attack time frame.<br />- More sophisticated exploits based on platforms integrated with Aave, dependant on their particular implementation.</li></ul><p>With a carefully designed plan, potentially involving some kind of social engineering, it can’t be discarded that some users could have loss of funds if the attacker realised the WETHGateway attack vector, which involves quite a deep understanding of the system. The rest of the problems, even if tedious to fix, would have a solution.</p><p>Finally, the vulnerability was fixed and the system didn’t suffer any disruption of its operations, thanks to the report and help of Josselin Feist and the quick reaction of the Aave team. From the perspective of Aave, this reinforces two fundamental parts of our strategy:</p><ul><li>Our <a href=\"https://aave.com/bug-bounty/\">bug bounty program</a>, attracting more pairs of eyes over critical software like the Aave protocol. We have rewarded the attack vector disclosure with an amount of 25 000 USD.</li><li>The importance of quick reaction and well defined security procedures, looking from the perspective of potential consequences to this vulnerability if not solved quickly.</li></ul><p>For regular updates, feel free to follow Aave on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AaveAave\">Twitter</a> or join the <a href=\"https://aave.com/discord\">Discord</a>.</p><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=546bf964689d\" width=\"1\" /><hr /><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/aave/aave-security-newsletter-546bf964689d\">Aave Security Newsletter</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://medium.com/aave\">Aave Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>"}

The protocol quickly grew to <a href=\"https://aave.com/\"><strong>over $1B market size</strong></a><strong> </strong>in less than 6 months, record growth for the DeFi space! V1 brought to market innovations like Flash Loans and aTokens as new ways to unlock previously locked capital in DeFi and provide a permissionless savings account.</p><p>The Aave Protocol took major steps toward becoming more decentralised with the handover of the Admin Keys to the community. The Aave ethos is that finance should be as you like it, and with a working governance and “Aavenomics”, the future of the protocol is in your hands.</p><p>This week the Aave Protocol hit another major milestone, with $1B in Flash Loans volume! Due to the 0.09% fee for Flash Loans, this has created an additional $906K going to reward depositors since the launch of V1.</p><p>Today, the Genesis Team is happy to introduce some Aavesome new features to unlock more value in DeFi and make the overall experience more seamless.</p><p>The Genesis Team is excited about this glow up, and your feedback throughout the V1 phase has been the inspiration for these updates. For more details on V2, feel free to read the <a href=\"https://github.com/aave/protocol-v2/blob/master/aave-v2-whitepaper.pdf\"><strong>Whitepaper</strong></a>.</p><h3><strong>What’s new with V2?</strong></h3><h4><strong>Yield &amp; Collateral swap</strong></h4><p>In DeFi, assets that were being used as collateral were tied up, but now with V2 they are free to be traded. Users can trade their deposited assets, across all currencies supported in the Aave Protocol, even when they are being used as collateral. Collateral swapping can be a useful tool to avoid liquidations. If the price of your collateral starts to fall, for example, you can simply trade it for a stablecoin so you don’t have to worry about price fluctuations and potential liquidation. This feature also allows you to swap your assets to get the best yields on the market, essentially creating the first market for collateral and yield trading in DeFi.</p><h4><strong>Flash Loans Upgraded</strong></h4><p>Flash Loans were the first undercollateralised loan option to shake up the DeFi space, resulting in the creation of many innovative tools and “money legos”. Flash Loans continued to inspire ideas to make new features possible in Aave V2.</p><h4><strong>Repayment with collateral</strong></h4><p>Before V2, if a user wanted to use part of their collateral to repay a loan, they had to first withdraw the collateral, use it to buy the borrowed asset, and then finally repay the debt and unlock the deposited collateral. This requires at least 4 transactions across multiple protocols, costing time and money and making for an overall not-so-seamless experience. This new feature allows users to close their loan positions by paying directly with their collateral in just 1 transaction — smooth and simple.</p><h4><strong>Flash liquidations</strong></h4><p>Previously, a liquidator needed to have capital in their own wallet or source it from somewhere else in order to liquidate a position and get that liquidation bonus. Flash Loans are a great equaliser that make it possible for everyone to have access to liquidity so they can take advantage of the financial tools DeFi offers. With Aave V2, liquidators can utilise Flash Loans to flash borrow the capital from the Aave Protocol itself in order to execute a liquidation.</p><h4><a href=\"https://twitter.com/fifikobayashi/status/1332257740123566081\"><strong>Batch Flash Loans</strong></a></h4><p>Flash Loans are getting more powerful. With V1, Flash-borrowers could only borrow one currency at a time. Batch Flash Loans let developers execute a Flash Loan with multiple assets inside the same tx. This means a Flash-borrower can access virtually all the Protocol liquidity.</p><h4><strong>Debt Tokenization</strong></h4><p>In V2, debt positions are tokenized, so borrowers will receive tokens that represent their debt. This debt tokenisation enables native Credit Delegation within the Aave Protocol and allows borrowers to manage their debt position from cold wallets.</p><h4><strong>Native Credit Delegation</strong></h4><p>Undercollateralised loans in DeFi have been an increasingly popular way to open up access to liquidity without needing existing capital, and Native Credit Delegation will expand on this with V2.</p><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/StaniKulechov/status/1280500969986498561%22%20/\"><strong>Credit Delegation</strong></a><strong> </strong>was introduced back in July, and then the first Credit Delegation on Aave Protocol to <a href=\"https://medium.com/aave/first-credit-delegation-on-aave-protocol-to-deversifi-is-here-c6c0aedb70d4\"><strong>DeversiFi</strong></a><strong> </strong>happened over the summer, using <a href=\"https://www.openlaw.io/\"><strong>OpenLaw</strong></a><strong> </strong>to conclude the loan agreement. Credit Delegation received a lot of hype, and now Aave V2 makes it native! Credit Delegation is designed so that a borrower could be an institution, business, NGO, cryptocurrency exchange (like DeversiFi), and more, opening up DeFi as a source of liquidity to the rest of the financial world. CD enables delegators to earn extra yield on top of the yield they already earn from the protocol and borrowers to access an uncollateralized loan.</p><p>The next step will be to add Credit Delegation to the UI, but for now if you’re a developer, you can follow <a href=\"https://docs.aave.com/developers/v/2.0/guides/credit-delegation\"><strong>this tutorial</strong></a><strong> </strong>and try it out for yourself.</p><h4><strong>Gas Optimisations</strong></h4><p>Anyone using Ethereum recently has probably noticed some network congestion and high gas prices for transactions. To help mitigate these costs, Aave V2 introduces gas optimisations, lowering the cost of protocol transactions up to 50% in some cases!</p><h4><strong>Stable &amp; Variable Rate Borrowing</strong></h4><p>DeFi is all about giving you more options so you can get what you want from finance. With Aave V2, borrowers can have both a stable borrow position and a variable borrow position at the same time, with the same underlying asset, from the same wallet. This gives borrowers more options and flexibility for their loan position, and borrowers are still able to switch between the variable and stable rate at any time.</p><h3><strong>Decentralised Access to V2</strong></h3><p>In the spirit of decentralisation, you can access Aave V2 directly from:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.argent.xyz/\"><strong>Argent</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://zapper.fi/\"><strong>Zapper</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://zerion.io/\"><strong>Zerion</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://token.im/\"><strong>imToken</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://defisaver.com/\"><strong>DeFi Saver</strong></a></li></ul><p>You should decide what your finances look like, and that includes having access to Aave’s financial tools and services directly from your favourite wallets and platforms.</p><h3><strong>Migration of Liquidity to V2</strong></h3><p>Recently <a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/aip-3-upgrade-aave-v1-lendingpool-contract-for-seamless-migration-to-v2/1383\"><strong>AIP-3</strong></a><strong> </strong>was passed to make the migration from V1 to V2 more seamless. By using a Flash Loan powered migration tool, users will be able to make the transition without having to close their V1 loan positions.</p><p>This migration tool will be introduced later, so if you have V1 positions, no need to close them.</p><h3><strong>Security &amp; Audits</strong></h3><p>Security is the top priority at Aave. Formal verification was completed by <a href=\"https://github.com/aave/protocol-v2/blob/master/audits/Certora-FV-aave-v2-03-12-2020.pdf\"><strong>Certora</strong></a>, and you can read the full report <a href=\"https://github.com/aave/protocol-v2/blob/master/audits/Certora-FV-aave-v2-03-12-2020.pdf\"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p><p>Aave V2 has been audited by <a href=\"https://github.com/aave/protocol-v2/blob/master/audits/Mixbytes-aave-v2-03-12-2020.pdf\"><strong>MixBytes</strong></a>; <a href=\"https://github.com/aave/protocol-v2/blob/master/audits/Certik-aave-v2-03-12-2020.pdf\"><strong>CertiK</strong></a>; <a href=\"https://consensys.net/diligence/audits/2020/09/aave-protocol-v2/\"><strong>ConsenSys Diligence</strong></a>; and <a href=\"https://github.com/aave/protocol-v2/blob/master/audits/Peckshield-aave-v2-03-12-2020-EN.pdf\"><strong>PeckShield</strong></a>, which includes an additional audit report in Chinese. Aave is the first company in the industry to do this, thus appealing to the growing Chinese market. A 5th audit by <a href=\"https://www.smartcontractaudits.com/audit-provider/sigma-prime\"><strong>Sigma Prime</strong></a> is coming soon, and that will also be available publicly.</p><p>In addition to the smart contract audits, Aave is working with Gauntlet to test the financial infrastructure of the protocol: resilience to attacks by bad actors as well as incentives for honest participants. A Market Risk Assessment Report will present the market and liquidity risks of Aave’s assets as well as their performance under extreme scenarios with optimised parameter suggestions. Further analysis will assess the Ethereum congestion risk and how to make Aave more resilient.</p><h3><strong>Reserve Factor and Parameters Changes</strong></h3><p>The DeFi space has witnessed incredible growth and battle testing leading to a risk reduction across the Aave Market. Furthermore, the Aave ecosystem is mature with an involved and educated community. V2 pushes some of Aave’s current borrowing limits with an optimisation of the risk parameters:</p><ul><li>Increased collateral capacity for USDC, BAT, LINK, UNI, WBTC and WETH</li><li>Cheaper stablecoin borrowing rates below optimal utilisation</li></ul><p>V2 also introduces a Reserve Factor to finance the long term sustainability of the DAO. The Reserve Factor allocates a share of the protocol’s income to the ecosystem reserve. This reserve is used to sustain the DAO and pay contributors. One of the key expenses of the DAO is to reward Safety Module Stakers who cover the risk of deficit. As such, the Reserve Factor is also a risk premium and so it is calibrated based on the overall risk of the asset.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/880/1*3-Us5DnfjNyURtoDjJQYZQ.png\" /></figure><h3><strong>Thank you for being part of the journey</strong></h3><p>Aave has partnered up with Coingecko for an epic contest:</p><ul><li>5000 candies gets you an Aave Ultraswag pack with 1 backpack, 1 t-shirt, 1 beanie and a special NFT “<a href=\"https://twitter.com/AaveChan\"><strong>Aave-Chan</strong></a>” (10 units)!</li><li>1500 candies gets you a special edition Aave-Chan NFT (490 units)</li></ul><p>Additionally, to celebrate the launch of V2, the first 100 addresses to use V2 and deposit at least $100 worth of assets for at least 10 days will receive an extra-special “pioneers” NFT in partnership with <a href=\"https://www.poap.xyz/\"><strong>POAP</strong></a>!</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*-8ZJpBwx9bLAQNtz\" /></figure><p>The Genesis Team can’t wait to hear what you think about V2!

It is the first ecosystem designed to accommodate the scale of global finance, with near-instant transaction finality. That means that after issuing a transaction to the network it will be included in the chain within about two seconds and is immutable from there on. Ethereum has a finality of about 15 minutes and Bitcoin has a finality of about one hour.</p><p>Avalanche is a global financial network for the issuing and trading of all digital goods. The Avalanche network enables potentially millions of validators to process thousands of transactions per second using a protocol which is completely green and quiescent. This high-throughput and fast finality protocol has been paired with an architecture that can meet the needs of unique financial services and decentralized apps.</p><p>This is accomplished through the notion of Subnets. Subnets allow anyone, anywhere to spin up a taylor-made network with custom virtual machines and complex validator rulesets. Avalanche is a network of networks. It’s a platform of platforms where we invision thousands and thousands of public and private Subnets all emerging into this global marketplace which we call The Internet of Finance.</p><h3>Unique Features</h3><p>Avalanche has 3 unique features which set it apart from competitors. Consensus, Virtual Machines and Subnets.</p><p>Consensus is the process of getting a set of computers to agree on something and it’s a rich field of computer science dating back 40 years. Avalanche Consensus represents the 3rd major paradigm in the field of consensus and is a metastable consensus protocol inspired by epidemic protocols and gossip networks. Avalanche Consensus enables tens of thousands of transactions per second, with sub-second immutable and irreversible finality validated by potentially millions of validators globally. Here is an <a href=\"https://tedyin.com/archive/snow-bft-demo/#/snow\">Avalanche Consensus Demo</a> created by Ava Labs’ Ted Yin.</p><p>A Virtual Machine is the blueprint for a custom blockchain on the Avalanche network. VMs contain the application-level logic for your blockchain and are akin to a class in object-oriented programming. A VM can be instantiated into many different instances of blockchains — each completely independent and with it’s own state. VMs aren’t limited to existing blockchain tech use cases such as P2P payments or defi and can be any use case which requires decentralization and consensus. VMs can be implemented in any language which can implement a GRPC API which enables developers to leverage modern tools and workflows which they’re familiar with.</p><p>A Subnet is a dynamic set of Validators working together to achieve consensus on the state of a set of blockchains. Subnets can compose their constituent validator sets via powerful rulesets. Subnets can be permissioned or permissionless — public or private. Subnets are used for scaling by enabling developers to launch application-specific-blockchains on different Subnets as opposed to many apps sharing the same blockchain. Subnets can communicate via Avalanche Warp Messaging.</p><h3>Consensus</h3><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ekX6sCqfp7XbLBerFUtg5A.png\" /></figure><p>As previously mentioned, Avalanche Consensus is the 3rd major paradigm in the field of consensus. The first was called Classical Consensus and it goes back to the 80s. Classical Consensus has low latency and very high throughput. It’s lightweight and green. However it isn’t very scalable nor robust and it performs poorly in adversarial conditions.</p><p>In 2008/2009 when Satoshi Nakamoto released Bitcoin the world was introduced to the 2nd major paradigm in the field of consensus, what ultimately became known as Nakamoto Consensus. Nakamoto Consensus is very scalable, robust and decentralized but it doesn’t have low latency, it takes around an hour to be sure your transaction is sufficiently settled that you won’t experience a reorg. It doesn’t have high throughput, Bitcoin only does a handful of transaction per second. It’s not lightweight or green, Bitcoin burns more energy each day than some nation states. Lastly, Nakamoto Consensus performs ok in adversarial conditions up to the famous 51% attack.</p><p>In 2018 a pseudonymous group going by the name “Team Rocket” released a white paper on the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) describing a 3rd major paradigm shift in the field of consensus. This new breakthrough was known as Avalanche Consensus. Avalanche Consensus is the perfect storm of features from Classical and Nakamoto Consensus.</p><p>It’s very scalable, robust and decentralized. There are currently around 1500 full block and vertex producing validators on the Avalanche network. The protocol theoretically enables millions of validators so it’s very decentralized. Avalanche consensus has low latency with subsecond immutable and irreversible finality. There is no notion of a reorg on Avalanche. Within a literal blink of an eye your transaction has settled completely. Avalanche has high throughput with 10s of thousands of transactions per second. It’s very lightweight and green and can be run on a PC, a Macbook, a VPS droplet on the cloud and in the future on Internet of Things devices. And Avalanche consensus is parameterizable so it performs very well in adversarial conditions.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*2AG6HrNErZYiw304a3IONw.png\" /></figure><h3>Virtual Machines</h3><p>Traditional blockchain networks, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, consist of a single virtual machine and set of validators. Avalanche is a network of many different virtual machines all deployed on Subnets and communicating with each other as needed. This architecture leads to network effects on the individual blockchains and compound network effects between subnets and blockchains.</p><p>A Virtual Machine is a state machine. It specifies the blockchain’s state, state transition function, transactions, and the API through which users can interact with the blockchain. Every blockchain on Avalanche is an instance of a VM.</p><p>The way to think of a VM is like a class in OOP. A class is a description or an object. It’s a template from which you can instantiate as many objects as you wish. Each of these objects, though derived from a common template, are unique and logically separate entities with their own state. Similar to a class, a VM is a blueprint or template from which you can instantiate as many different instances of a blockchain as you wish. Each of these blockchains, though derived from a common template, are unique and logically separate entities with their own state.</p><p>As a developer when you write a VM, you don’t need to concern yourself with lower-level logic like networking, consensus, or the structure of the blockchain. Avalanche does this behind the scenes so you can focus on the thing you would like to build.</p><p>On Avalanche you can build your VM in any language that you choose.

Subnets are independent, they specify their own execution logic, determine their own fee regime, maintain their own state, facilitate their own networking, and provide their own security. They don’t share execution thread, storage or networking with other Subnets including the Primary Network, effectively allowing the network to scale up easily while enabling lower latency, higher transactions per second (TPS), and lower transaction costs provided by the Avalanche Consensus.</p><p>A Subnet manages its own membership, it can create its own token economics and rules, and may require that its constituent validators have certain properties.</p><h3>Independent Token Economics</h3><p>Subnets can have their own token economics with their own native tokens and fee markets. They can launch their own blockchains with customized virtual machines.</p><h3>Compliance</h3><p>Avalanche’s Subnet architecture makes regulatory compliance manageable. As mentioned above, a Subnet may require validators to meet a set of requirements.</p><p>Some examples of requirements include:</p><ul><li>Validators must be located in a given country</li><li>Validators must pass a KYC/AML checks</li><li>Validators must hold a certain license</li></ul><h3>Application-Specific Requirements</h3><p>Different blockchain-based applications may require validators to have certain properties. Suppose there is an application that requires large amounts of RAM or CPU power. A Subnet could require that validators meet certain hardware requirements so that the application doesn’t suffer from low performance due to slow validators.</p><h3>Support for Private Blockchains</h3><p>You can create a Subnet where only certain pre-defined validators may join and create a private Subnet where the contents of the blockchains would be visible only to those validators. This is ideal for organizations interested in keeping their information private. See here for more info.</p><h3>Separation of Concerns</h3><p>In a heterogeneous network of blockchains, some validators will not want to validate certain blockchains because they simply have no interest in those blockchains. The Subnet model allows validators to only concern themselves with blockchains that they care about. This reduces the burden on validators.</p><h3>Tools and Resources</h3><p>Following is a list of tools and resources to help developers onramp onto the Avalanche Platform. This should include running a node, sending it queries, SDKs for sending transactions, creating virtual machines and Subnets and the associated documentation.</p><h3>Avalanche Docs</h3><p>Here are the <a href=\"https://docs.avax.network/\">official Avalanche docs</a>. These are the canonical Avalanche platform docs.</p><h3>AvalancheGo</h3><p>AvalancheGo is a full Avalanche node. It’s written in Golang and required for running local networks for development or for running a node and connecting to the Fuji testnet or the mainnet.</p><p>The minimum recommended hardware specification for nodes connected to Mainnet is:</p><ul><li>CPU: Equivalent of 8 AWS vCPU</li><li>RAM: 16 GiB</li><li>Storage: 1 TiB</li><li>OS: Ubuntu 20.04/22.04 or macOS &gt;= 12</li><li>Network: Reliable IPv4 or IPv6 network connection, with an open public port.</li></ul><h3>Binary Install</h3><p>Download the <a href=\"https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanchego/releases/latest\">latest build</a> for your operating system and architecture. The Avalanche binary to be executed is named avalanchego.</p><p>You can also <a href=\"https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanchego#building-from-source\">build from source</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanchego#binary-repository\">install with </a><a href=\"https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanchego#binary-repository\">apt</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanchego#docker-install\">install with docker</a>.</p><h3>Connect to the Network</h3><pre>./path/to/avalanchego --http-host=my.http.host --network-id=fuji --public-ip=my.ip.address</pre><p>By default avalanchego will connect to the mainnet which will require significantly more time to bootstrap than the fuji network. Configure which network the node should bootstrap by passing in the --network-id flag. You can get funds for the Testnet from <a href=\"https://faucet.avax.network/\">the faucet</a>.</p><p>To be able to make API calls to your node from other machines, when starting up the node include the --http-host= flag. In order to ensure your node is well-connected, make sure that your node can receive and send TCP traffic on the staking port (9651 by default) and that you started your node with config flag --public-ip=[YOUR NODE'S PUBLIC IP HERE]. Failing to do either of these may jeopardize your staking reward.</p><p>Starting a full node this way is fine if you’re doing short-term experimental work. For instances where you intend to keep your node online for longer you should set up a system service. The <a href=\"https://docs.avax.network/nodes/build/set-up-node-with-installer\">installer script</a> can do that for you.</p><p>AvalancheGo is a core software component needed for developing dapps and VMs for Avalanche. It’s required for running an individual node and a local test network. More info: <a href=\"https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanchego\">Github Repo</a>.</p><h3>Avalanche Network Runner</h3><p>While AvalancheGo is useful for running a single node the Avalanche Network Runner (ANR) is a tool to run and interact with a local Avalanche network and is especially useful for development and testing.</p><h3>Installation</h3><p>To download a binary for the latest release, run:</p><pre>curl -sSfL &lt;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ava-labs/avalanche-network-runner/main/scripts/install.sh&gt; | sh -s</pre><p>The binary will be installed inside the ~/bin directory.

This is great for interacting with the X, P or C-chains. However, if you want to deploy and test Subnets then you want to use AvalancheCli. Avalanche CLI is a command line tool that gives developers access to everything Avalanche. This release specializes in helping developers develop and test subnets.</p><h3>Installation</h3><p>The tool has been tested on Linux and Mac. Windows is currently not supported.

It is built using TypeScript and intended to support both browser and Node.js. The AvalancheJS library allows you to issue commands to the Avalanche node APIs.</p><p>The APIs currently supported by default are:</p><ul><li>Admin API</li><li>Auth API</li><li>AVM API (X-Chain)</li><li>EVM API (C-Chain)</li><li>Health API</li><li>Index API</li><li>Info API</li><li>Keystore API</li><li>Metrics API</li><li>PlatformVM API (P-Chain)</li><li>Socket</li></ul><h3>Installation</h3><p>Avalanche is available for install via yarn:</p><pre>yarn add avalanche</pre><p>You can also pull the repo down directly and build it from scratch:</p><pre>yarn build</pre><h3>Examples</h3><p>AvalancheJS has dozens of example scripts in the examples/ directory.</p><pre>ts-node examples/info/isBootstrapped.ts<br />true</pre><p>More info on AvalancheJS in the <a href=\"https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanchejs\">Github Repo</a></p><h3>Glacier</h3><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*g4lntWe8ODcv0g9s-igQhg.png\" /></figure><p>The Glacier API is a developer’s one-stop-shop for all enriched blockchain data from Avalanche and Ethereum and the official API service indexing Avalanche Subnets.</p><p>The Glacier API Beta gives developers a wide range of useful data for explorer and wallet services, token transfers and more. Originally created to power the Avalanche Subnet Block Explorer, Glacier also powers Core Wallet — providing balances, transfers, and associated metadata for native assets, ERC-20 tokens and NFTs.</p><p>With Glacier, application developers can easily build products that leverage real-time and historical transaction data — all served through highly performant APIs. Developers that join the Glacier API Beta will get access to the platform’s service for free and have the opportunity to shape future feature development.</p><p>Glacier’s capabilities as a powerful indexed blockchain data provider will expand to include additional raw and derived transaction data as user feedback helps guide this process.</p><p>There is a public <a href=\"https://glacier-api.avax.network/\">Swagger UI</a> for quickly testing out the Glacier API and customizing requests POST body and copying curl statements for easily sharing requests.</p><p>For example, first let’s GET the list of chains supported by the api.

This consent layer records on-chain customer consent for brands to use insights generated from customers’ anonymized data. The result: brands can access richer data troves, while everyday people can get rewarded for sharing their anonymized data with brands.</p><p>The consent layer is a big step toward the full launch of Snickerdoodle’s Marketing Platform and Data Wallet, which together give brands powerful tools for monetizing data and rewarding customers for sharing their anonymized data. The new customer-brand data economy that Snickerdoodle creates embodies the open, equitable, user-first spirit of Web3 and marks a necessary upgrade from centralized and less private Web2 data sharing models.</p><p>The Snickerdoodle Data Wallet, which is in<a href=\"https://early-access.snickerdoodle.com/\"> private beta</a>, empowers everyday people by giving them back their privacy and data sovereignty, while unlocking new opportunities to allow them to generate value from their data.</p><p>The Snickerdoodle Marketing Platform also empowers brands, providing them with a privacy-first tool to better understand and engage their customers and communities. Within the Snickerdoodle Marketing Platform, brands can learn more about their customers by deploying consent contracts that are received by customers in their Data Wallets. Customers have control over what they want to share and can provide auditable consent to share anonymized data. The Snickerdoodle Marketing Platform makes it simple for brands to learn more about their customers through integrated data dashboards by running campaigns and distributing rewards while respecting data privacy standards.</p><p>Brands are already using the platform in <a href=\"https://early-access.snickerdoodle.com/marketing-platform-waitlist/\">private beta testing</a>. “The ability to get consent from individuals to share anonymized Web3 and Web2 data insights with us is a game changer — total marketing unlock,” said private beta tester Sebastian Quinn, Founder of Yesports and Co-Founder of Yieldly.</p><blockquote>“We believe that people need the ability to own their data and the value it generates,” said Jonathan Padilla, CEO of Snickerdoodle Labs. “Additionally, brands need tools to engage and learn from their customers in a decentralized fashion. Avalanche’s speed, reliability, and cost efficiency make them the perfect solution to allow our business to scale. We are thrilled to be part of their amazing ecosystem and believe this partnership will bring long-term success for the collective.”</blockquote><p>Consumers deserve more for sharing their data. Snickerdoodle rewards them with NFTs, tokens, and more for doing so. On top of benefiting customers, Snickerdoodle’s rewards enhance a brand’s omnichannel marketing strategy, providing new opportunities to create relationships based on clear exchanges of value.</p><blockquote>“Snickerdoodle has the potential to disrupt the entrenched Web2 data model in a way that gives agency and tangible benefits to brands and users alike,” said John Nahas, Vice President of Business Development at Ava Labs. “We’re very excited to see how the Snickerdoodle platform develops and how it benefits the Avalanche community, and we look forward to showcasing it at Avalanche Summit in May.”</blockquote><p>To join the private beta<em> </em>and learn more, please visit: <a href=\"http://www.snickerdoodle.com\">www.snickerdoodle.com</a></p><p>For further information, contact:<br />Snickerdoodle Labs<br />Shira Stember, CMO &amp; Co-founder<br />Email: hi@snickerdoodlelabs.io</p><h3><strong>About Avalanche</strong></h3><p>Avalanche is a smart contracts platform that scales infinitely and regularly finalizes transactions in less than one second.

Rowe Price Associates, WisdomTree, Wellington Management, and Cumberland. Participating institutions will be using Spruce as a testnet for a variety of applications and assets to measure the benefits of on-chain trade execution and settlement.</p><blockquote>“Participating in the Avalanche Spruce testnet presents a valuable opportunity to deepen our understanding and analysis of smart contract technology and the potential applications of public, permissioned blockchains in financial markets,” said Blue Macellari, Head of Digital Assets Strategy, T. Rowe Price Associates.</blockquote><p>The Spruce testnet is meant to enable buy- and sell-side institutions to engage with public blockchain infrastructure in a low-risk, low barrier-to-entry manner. Using valueless tokens allows institutional participants to experience the full functionality of Avalanche’s Subnet architecture without putting capital at risk.</p><p>Institutional partners will use DeFi applications on Spruce to execute foreign exchange (FX) and interest rate swaps, with other areas in active research and development. Future phases of Spruce will welcome additional third-party applications, assets, and processes, including the exploration of tokenized equity and credit issuance, trading, and fund management. Institutions will be key in providing ongoing feedback about Subnet architecture, integrations, and capabilities in order to ensure a successful and scalable mainnet implementation.</p><blockquote>“We believe tokenization and blockchain will play an important role in financial services going forward,” said Will Peck, Head of Digital Assets, WisdomTree. “Avalanche Spruce provides an opportunity to further explore the potential efficiencies and benefits of on-chain trading and settlement with other financial institutions. We are looking forward to experimenting in this EVM-based testing environment.”</blockquote><p>Upon onboarding, institutions’ wallets are issued non-transferable tokens (NTTs) indicating they’ve passed KYC/KYB checks; in addition, their wallet addresses are embedded in an allowlist, which monitors access at the chain level. Smart contract deployers who have integrated key infrastructure and applications also undergo the onboarding process for their activity on Spruce.</p><p>In a <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4328948\">recent research report</a>, executives from Uniswap Labs and Circle Internet Financial cited a 2022 BIS Triennial Survey indicating that “around one-third of deliverable FX turnover, around $2.2 trillion, is at risk on any given day, up from $1.9 trillion in 2019.” Potential benefits of on-chain FX and cross-border payments include payment vs payment transactions, atomic settlement, and reduced counterparty risk.</p><p>Said Mark Garabedian, Director, Digital Assets and Tokenization at Wellington Management:</p><blockquote>“Avalanche Subnets provide a potential settlement solution that enables financial transactions with enhanced operational efficiencies, reduced risks, and regulatory compliance without creating liquidity islands or reduced interoperability. We look forward to experimenting with this technology to determine its suitability for institutional workflows, and its potential to reduce costs thus adding value for our clients.”</blockquote><p>Said John Wu, President of Ava Labs:</p><blockquote>“This groundbreaking collaboration creates a secure, controlled, and exciting opportunity for the world’s financial institutions. We see Spruce, and more broadly, Avalanche Evergreen subnets, as a meaningful step in exploring the possibilities of digital finance.”</blockquote><p>Spruce is a type of Evergreen Subnet for institutional blockchain deployments. Evergreen Subnets are EVM-based chains with a permissioned validator set and a custom gas token to power transactions. Ultimately, Spruce and the Evergreen Subnets aim to address many of the issues with permissioned DeFi precluding broader institutional adoption of public blockchain infrastructure.</p><p><strong>Get in touch to launch your use case with Evergreen Subnets, or to discuss further:</strong></p><ul><li>Visit <a href=\"https://www.avax.com/evergreen\">https://www.avax.com/evergreen</a></li><li>Reach out to Morgan Krupetsky, Director of BD, Institutions &amp; Capital Markets at Ava Labs: <a href=\"mailto:morgan.krupetsky@avalabs.org\">morgan.krupetsky@avalabs.org</a></li></ul><h3>About Avalanche</h3><p>Avalanche is a smart contracts platform that scales infinitely and regularly finalizes transactions in less than one second.

Crucially, Evergreen Subnets maintain the benefits of public network development while enabling particular features historically only possible within enterprise solutions.</p><blockquote>“Thus far, financial institutions’ enterprise blockchain applications have been hindered by a walled-garden approach that, among other things, restricts liquidity and interoperability from initiative to initiative,” said Morgan Krupetsky, Director of Business Development for Institutions and Capital Markets, Ava Labs. “However, there continues to be a significant need for customization and control, particularly among institutional use cases. The Avalanche network ultimately offers a perfect synthesis of the strengths of public and private blockchains, which is why we’re so thrilled to debut Avalanche Evergreen.”</blockquote><p>Institutions are easily able to launch their own Evergreen Subnets for either research and development purposes or production-ready use cases as they continue exploring blockchain benefits around process efficiencies, transparency, composability, asset tokenization, and more. With Evergreen Subnets, institutions can pursue their blockchain and digital asset strategies in private, permissioned chains with known and approved counterparties, while retaining the ability to communicate and interoperate with other Subnets through Avalanche’s native communication protocol called Avalanche Warp Messaging (AWM). AWM provides a messaging layer that enables seamless on-chain asset swapping, data transfer, confirmations, and other types of intra- and inter-institutional communications without relying on third party intermediaries or bridges.</p><h4><strong>AVALANCHE SUBNETS</strong></h4><p>Avalanche’s unique Subnet architecture can empower everyone from individual builders and teams, to institutions and government agencies, to launch custom blockchains optimized for their specific use case. Subnets are seamlessly interoperable with the broader Avalanche network, but isolate traffic to dedicated infrastructure securing the chain, enabling Avalanche to scale without limits. Currently the Avalanche network already boasts several EVM-based Subnet deployments on Mainnet and Testnet across industries and use cases, including DeFi, Gaming, NFTs, enterprises and institutions. A few examples include the Intain Subnet — a tokenized Asset Backed Securities (ABS) administration application and marketplace; the Dexalot Subnet — an on-chain central limit order book; and the Deloitte Subnet — a platform for more efficient FEMA fund disbursements.</p><p><strong>Get in touch to launch your use case with Evergreen Subnets, or to discuss further:</strong></p><ul><li>Visit <a href=\"https://www.avax.com/evergreen\">https://www.avax.com/evergreen</a></li><li>Reach out to Morgan Krupetsky, Director of BD, Institutions &amp; Capital Markets at Ava Labs: <a href=\"mailto:morgan.krupetsky@avalabs.org\">morgan.krupetsky@avalabs.org</a></li></ul><h3>About Avalanche</h3><p>Avalanche is a smart contracts platform that scales infinitely and regularly finalizes transactions in less than one second.

Other gaming studios will be able to leverage the GUNZ SDK and white-label components, such as a built-in companion app, marketplace, and NFT minting engine, to build and launch their own projects on GUNZ.</p><p>Designed with the gaming community and blockchain enthusiasts in mind, GUNZ aims to give players the option to get involved in Play-to-Own mechanics by offering verifiable transparency. The platform will be first integrated into Gunzilla Games’ upcoming Battle Royale 2.0 game, <a href=\"https://gameoffthegrid.com\"><em>Off The Grid (OTG)</em></a><em>.</em></p><p><em>OTG</em> aims to revolutionize the Battle Royale genre by emphasizing storytelling and digital ownership, allowing players to influence both gameplay and narrative through their in-game decisions. GUNZ strives to be one of the first player-friendly crypto-economies in a AAA game, aiming to empower players by granting them complete ownership over their in-game items in the form of NFTs.</p><p>More projects building on GUNZ will be announced soon.</p><blockquote>“Our partnership with Avalanche not only allows us to leverage its highly scalable and secure blockchain infrastructure but also ensures a seamless, low-latency gaming experience for our players,” explained Vlad Korolov, CEO and Co-Founder of Gunzilla Games, “By building GUNZ, we aim to revolutionize the gaming landscape with a transparent in-game asset management system by providing a number of market-standard features for game developers who are creating their economy on blockchain.”</blockquote><p>Avalanche launched in September 2020, ushering in a new era for blockchains with near-instant transaction finality. Today, Avalanche supports 500+ applications and secures billions of dollars in value, all while having minimal climate impact. Avalanche also supports Subnets like Gunz — custom, app-specific blockchains allowing the network to scale nearly infinitely.</p><p>The partnership between Gunzilla Games and Ava Labs, the main developer of Avalanche, is another great recent example of gaming leaders recognizing the power of Avalanche Subnets to provide the best gaming experience.</p><blockquote>“Gunzilla Games has ambitious plans to migrate the best of Web2 gaming to Web3 while delivering the top-tier quality gamers demand,” said Emin Gün Sirer, Founder and CEO of Ava Labs. “The Off The Grid Subnet and Web3 publishing stack are amazing additions to the new wave of Avalanche games.”</blockquote><p>To make sure you don’t miss any updates and for more information on Gunzilla, follow the studio on<a href=\"https://www.twitter.com/gunzillagames\"> Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/gunzillagames\">Instagram</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/gunzillagames\">Facebook</a>.</p><h3><strong>About Avalanche</strong></h3><p>Avalanche is a smart contracts platform that scales infinitely and regularly finalizes transactions in less than one second.

Joepegs, the largest NFT Marketplace on Avalanche, accounted for ~$859k in volume. According to <a href=\"http://avalytics.xyz\">avalytics.xyz</a>, the largest collections in March are as follows:</p><ol><li>OOPA (16371 AVAX) — OOPA is an NFT collection derived from other NFT collections called APA (Avalanche Party Animals) and Golden Token. OOPAs were by far the most popular NFT collection of March.</li><li>Chikn (7740 AVAX) — Chikn NFTs are perhaps the most famous upgradable NFT collection on Avalanche and are used in the Chikn NFT gaming ecosystem.</li><li>Golden Token (6197 AVAX) — Used to transform APAs into OOPAs</li><li>Ferdy Fish (5560 AVAX) — A collection of 300 NFTs, Ferdy Fish’s floor price has risen dramatically in March from around 17 AVAX to 90 AVAX.</li><li>Smol Joes (4034 AVAX) — Originally a free mint, Smol Joes are one of the first big NFT collections on Avalanche.

Ignite allows decentralized staking that reduces the cost to run an Avalanche node by up to 10x. Instead of native validator staking, which requires 2000 AVAX, Ignite users can spin up a node for 200 AVAX worth of the QI token. This liquid staking solution expands the number of potential stakeholders in the Avalanche ecosystem, so more developers, projects, and stakers can reap the full benefit of Avalanche validators.</p><p>Liquid staking solutions are popular among other proof-of-stake blockchains like Ethereum. Ignite is different from Ethereum liquid staking solutions because BenQi Subnet validators get exposure to both AVAX rewards and Subnet rewards. Rewards from Ignite validators will also be higher than delegation alone, since running a validator bypasses the need to pay delegation fees.</p><h4><strong>Cross-Chain Comparison</strong></h4><p>It can be difficult to find ways to fairly compare blockchain networks since there are not standard metric definitions. For instance, a single transaction on one blockchain network could equate to several on a different network, so metrics like transactions per second may be misleading.</p><p>One way to comparatively measure blockchain networks is by True Network Value, which factors in block size, time-to-finality, and the number of validators of a network. Block size was calculated using the average block size of the last 30 days. You can read more about True Network Value <a href=\"https://research.thetie.io/true-network-value/#:~:text=True%20Network%20Value%20holistically%20demonstrates,for%20geographical%20distribution%20of%20validators.\">here</a>.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*sIp8vSEhI5UJBQld\" /></figure><p>The chart above shows Avalanche as a clear leader in TNV among other L1 alternatives. Factors include validator count, block size, and time-to-finality.</p><h3>About Avalanche</h3><p>Avalanche is a smart contracts platform that scales infinitely and regularly finalizes transactions in less than one second.

However, some CLI flags have undergone changes.</p>\n<p>See the sections below for details on other backwards-incompatible changes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Removed CLI flags</li>\n<li>Deprecated CLI flags</li>\n<li>Database schema upgrade</li>\n<li>Logfile format (for developers)</li>\n<li>Modified HTTP APIs (for developers)</li>\n<li>Bootnode configuration (for developers)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>⚠️ Removed CLI flags ⚠️</h3>\n<p>The following CLI flags which were previously deprecated have been removed from the beacon node. If you are still using them you need to delete them in order to run v7.1.0:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>--eth1</code></li>\n<li><code>--dummy-eth1</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition, the <code>crit</code> log level can no longer be provided to the flags <code>--debug-level</code> or <code>--logfile-debug-level</code>. We do not anticipate that this affects many users, as logging just <code>CRIT</code>s is an extremely unusual configuration.</p>\n<h3>📢 Deprecated CLI flags 📢</h3>\n<p>The following CLI flags have been deprecated and will result in warning logs if provided. You do not have to remove them immediately, but they are no longer functional and will trigger an error in a future version:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>--logfile</code> (replaced by <code>--logfile-dir</code>)</li>\n<li><code>--eth1-blocks-per-log-query</code></li>\n<li><code>--eth1-purge-cache</code></li>\n<li><code>--eth1-cache-follow-distance</code></li>\n<li><code>--disable-deposit-contract-sync</code></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Database Schema Upgrade</h3>\n<p>The beacon node database schema has been updated from v22 to v26 in order to support hot hierarchical state diffs and the upcoming Fulu fork. An <strong>automatic database migration</strong> will be applied upon upgrading to v7.1.0, and requires no manual intervention.</p>\n<p>If you wish to <strong>downgrade</strong> to v7.0.1 you will have to manually migrate the database to schema v22 following the instructions for <a href=\"https://lighthouse-book.sigmaprime.io/advanced_database_migrations.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Database Migrations</a>.</p>\n<h2>Breaking Changes For Developers 💻</h2>\n<h3>Logfile Format</h3>\n<p>Lighthouse's text logging format has been changed slightly as we upgrade to <code>tracing</code>. We have endeavoured to keep things as similar as possible, but you may notice some differences, and any custom log parsers may need to be adjusted. We recommend using JSON logs for automated analysis.</p>\n<h3>Modified HTTP APIs</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Removed deprecated <code>POST /eth/v1/beacon/pool/attestations</code>.</li>\n<li>Removed legacy <code>Attestation</code> support from <code>POST /eth/v2/beacon/pool/attestations</code>. Only <code>SingleAttestation</code>s are now supported.</li>\n<li>Fixed handling of <code>[]</code> requests on the <code>POST /eth/v1/beacon/states/{state_id}/validator_balances</code> endpoint. See: <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" href=\"https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/pull/7474\">#7474</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Bootnode Configuration</h3>\n<p>Lighthouse now uses the more standard <code>bootstap_nodes.yaml</code> filename for bootnodes instead of <code>boot_enr.yaml</code>. See: <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" href=\"https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/pull/6956\">#6956</a></p>\n<h2>Hierarchical State Diffs</h2>\n<p>Lighthouse's database has undergone another major upgrade, with the application of our <em>hierarchical state diff</em> scheme to the hot database. The result is greatly reduced I/O during normal operation (~4x reduction) due to less data stored on disk. As a trade-off, a little more CPU time is spent computing diffs. Overall total block import times should remain similar, but the reduction in I/O should help reduce 2nd order slowdowns (e.g. competition with the EL for IOPS) and improve attestation accuracy.</p>\n<p>In addition, Lighthouse's database is now much more well-suited to periods of non-finality -- Lighthouse nodes should no longer run out of disk space, even with multiple weeks of non-finality.</p>\n<p>The hot DB uses the same hierarchy configuration as the freezer DB, which keeps things simple and also enables some nice optimisations (like not re-computing diffs). For information on diff config, see the <a href=\"https://lighthouse-book.sigmaprime.io/advanced_database.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Database Configuration</a> section of the book.</p>\n<h2>Update Priority</h2>\n<p>This table provides priorities for which classes of users should update particular components.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>User Class</th>\n<th>Beacon Node</th>\n<th>Validator Client</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Staking Users</td>\n<td>Low</td>\n<td>Low</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Non-Staking Users</td>\n<td>Low</td>\n<td>---</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><em>See <a href=\"https://lighthouse-book.sigmaprime.io/installation_priorities.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Update Priorities</a> for more information about this table.</em></p>\n<p>Lighthouse v7.1.0 is fully interoperable with Lighthouse v7.0.x, so you can update BN and VC separately.</p>\n<h2>All Changes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Release v7.1.0 (<a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" href=\"https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/pull/7609\">#7609</a>)</li>\n<li>Error from RPC <code>send_response</code> when request doesn't exist on the active inbound requests (<a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" href=\"https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/pull/7663\">#7663</a>)</li>\n<li>Reintroduce <code>--logfile</code> with deprecation warning (<a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" href=\"https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/pull/7723\">#7723</a>)</li>\n<li>Merge remote-tracking branch 'origin/stable' into release-v7.1.0</li>\n<li>Gossip recently computed light client data (<a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" href=\"https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/pull/7023\">#7023</a>)</li>\n<li>Remove unneeded spans that caused debug logs to appear when level is set to <code>info</code> (<a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" href=\"https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/pull/7707\">#7707</a>)</li>\n<li>Bump default gas limit (<a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" href=\"https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/pull/7695\">#7695</a>)</li>\n<li>Fix lookups of the block at <code>oldest_block_slot</code> (<a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" href=\"https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/pull/7693\">#7693</a>)</li>\n<li>Record v2 beacon blocks http api metrics separately (<a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" href=\"https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/pull/7692\">#7692</a>)</li>\n<li>Fix and test checkpoint sync from genesis (<a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" href=\"https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/pull/7689\">#7689</a>)</li>\n<li>Update fulu network configs and add <code>MIN_EPOCHS_FOR_DATA_COLUMN_SIDECARS_REQUESTS</code> (<a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" href=\"https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/pull/7646\">#7646</a>)</li>\n<li>Use prepare_beacon_proposer endpoint for validator custody registration (<a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" href=\"https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/pull/7681\">#7681</a>)</li>\n<li>Update <code>SAMPLES_PER_SLOT</code> to be number of custody groups instead of data columns (<a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" href=\"https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/pull/7683\">#7683</a>)</li>\n<li>Custody persist fix (<a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" href=\"https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/pull/7661\">#7661</a>)</li>\n<li>Add voluntary exit via validator manager (<a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" href=\"https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/pull/6612\">#6612</a>)</li>\n<li>Test database schema stability (<a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" href=\"https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/pull/7669\">#7669</a>)</li>\n<li>Add Michael as codeowner for store crate (<a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" href=\"https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/pull/7667\">#7667</a>)</li>\n<li>Increase http client default timeout to 2s in <code>http-api</code> tests.

{"source": "Lighthouse_Releases", "title": "Summer Smith Prime", "url": "https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/releases/tag/v7.0.1", "published_utc": "2025-05-06T06:31:09Z", "retrieved_utc": "2025-08-14T23:25:12.505260Z", "keywords": [], "summary": "<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>This release includes the fork epoch for <strong>Electra</strong> ⚡ on Mainnet 🎉</p>\n<p>v7.0.1 is a hotfix for the increased number of state cache misses reported following the v7.0.0 release last week.</p>\n<p>If you have not yet upgraded to v7.0.0, it is recommended to upgrade straight to v7.0.1.  These release notes also describe all of the changes in v7.0.0.</p>\n<p>As a reminder, all mainnet users <strong>must upgrade</strong> to either v7.0.1 or v7.0.0 by the time of the fork on <strong>7 May 2025</strong>. You must also update your execution client (e.g. Geth, Nethermind, Erigon, Besu or Reth).</p>\n<h2>⚠️ Breaking Changes ⚠️</h2>\n<p>You can upgrade to v7.0.1 from any v5 or v6 release. If you are upgrading from v5 you should make sure to <a href=\"https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/releases/tag/v6.0.1\">read the v6 release notes</a> to account for breaking changes between v5 and v6.</p>\n<p>Upgrading to Lighthouse v7.0.1 should require no manual intervention aside from updating the binary or Docker image, as there are no changes to CLI flags that will prevent the node from starting. Mainnet users <strong>must</strong> upgrade before the Electra fork. Failure to upgrade in time will require a re-sync.</p>\n<p>Once you upgrade to Lighthouse v7.0.1, you <strong>can</strong> downgrade to v6, but only prior to the Electra fork.</p>\n<p>See the sections below for details on other backwards-incompatible changes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Deprecated CLI flags</li>\n<li>Minimum supported Rust version</li>\n<li>IPv6 by default</li>\n<li>Gas limit enforcement</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>⚠️ Deprecated CLI Flags ⚠️</h3>\n<p>The following beacon node flags have been deprecated. You should remove them, but the beacon node will still start if they are provided.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>--light-client-server</code></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>🦀 Minimum Supported Rust Version 🦀</h3>\n<p>We have updated the Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) for this release from 1.80.0 to 1.83.0.</p>\n<p><strong>This is only relevant to users compiling Lighthouse from source</strong>.</p>\n<p>You can update your Rust compiler using:</p>\n<div class=\"snippet-clipboard-content notranslate position-relative overflow-auto\"><pre class=\"notranslate\"><code>rustup update stable\n</code></pre></div>\n<h3>IPv6 by Default</h3>\n<p>Lighthouse will now automatically listen on IPv6 if it detects  a globally-routable address. We expect for the majority of users with IPv4-only setups that this change will have no effect, but that it will benefit users with correctly configured IPv6 stacks.</p>\n<p>The default IPv6 listening port has been changed from port 9090 to port 9000 (same as IPv4) to make firewalling easier. The IPv6 port can be adjusted using the flag <code>--port6</code>.</p>\n<p>You can opt-out of IPv6 by using the flag<code>--listen-address 0.0.0.0</code> to only listen on IPv4.</p>\n<p>For more information, see the Lighthouse blog:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://blog.sigmaprime.io/lighthouse-ipv6.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://blog.sigmaprime.io/lighthouse-ipv6.html</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Gas Limit Enforcement</h3>\n<p>Lighthouse BN now enforces gas limit preferences when validating execution payloads from external builders (e.g. <code>mev-boost</code> relays). You can configure the gas limit for all validators connected to a VC using <code>--gas-limit</code>, or set individual limits in the <a href=\"https://lighthouse-book.sigmaprime.io/validator_management.html#introducing-the-validator_definitionsyml-file\" rel=\"nofollow\"><code>validator_definitions.yml</code></a>, or using the <a href=\"https://lighthouse-book.sigmaprime.io/advanced_builders.html#set-gas-limit-via-http\" rel=\"nofollow\">VC HTTP API</a>.</p>\n<h2>⚡ Electra ⚡</h2>\n<p>The <em>Electra</em> hard fork, paired with the <em>Prague</em> hard fork on the execution layer – together known as <em>Pectra</em> – brings several new features to Ethereum.</p>\n<p>The headline change is known as <em>Max EB</em>, and raises the maximum effective balance a single validator may wield from 32 ETH to 2048 ETH. Once adopted, this will allow the network to run more efficiently with a lower validator count, while retaining the same level of security. Max EB even removes some centralisation vectors from staking incentives so that solo validators are able to tap into the compounding rewards previously enjoyed exclusively by large operators.</p>\n<p>The process of switching a validator's max effective balance is a <strong>consolidation</strong>, which transfers stake from one validator to another. Consolidations are triggered via a smart contract call, and are fully opt-in and voluntary. If you are a solo operator with a small number of validators, there is no need to consolidate, although you may choose to do so.</p>\n<p>Information about consolidation tooling has been added to the Lighthouse book:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://lighthouse-book.sigmaprime.io/validator_consolidation.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://lighthouse-book.sigmaprime.io/validator_consolidation.html</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>\n<h3>State Cache Misses</h3>\n<p>A number of users reported seeing an increased number of state cache misses following the update to v7.0.0:</p>\n<div class=\"snippet-clipboard-content notranslate position-relative overflow-auto\"><pre class=\"notranslate\"><code>Apr 30 15:45:30.000 WARN State cache missed\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>We have restored the state cache size to 128 in order to reduce cache misses, and will continue optimising the cache for non-finality. See the issue for details: <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" href=\"https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/issues/7363\">#7363</a></p>\n<h3>Bugfix for <code>InsufficientPeers</code></h3>\n<p>Both v7.0.1 and v7.0.0 include a bugfix for a regression in attestation subscription logic, resolving <code>InsufficientPeers</code> errors.</p>\n<h2>New Features</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Electra fork epoch for Gnosis chain.</li>\n<li>Light client server enabled by default.</li>\n<li>Support for a new database backend, <code>redb</code>. This is still experimental and only reccommended for expert users.</li>\n<li>New API to add trusted peers at runtime (<a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" href=\"https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/pull/7198\">#7198</a>).</li>\n<li>Full Hoodi testnet support (<code>--network hoodi</code>).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Optimisations</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Smarter state cache heuristics.</li>\n<li>More efficient serving of <code>BlocksByRange</code>/<code>BlobsByRange</code> during non-finality.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Known Issues</h2>\n<p>There are few minor issues being investigated.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Some users report their <code>lighthouse vc</code> processes seizing up and becoming unresponsive. A workaround for this issue is to run a script that regularly polls the validator client HTTP API, e.g. <code>while sleep 5; do curl -s --fail \"http://localhost:5062/lighthouse/auth\" &gt; /dev/null &amp;&amp; echo \"polled at $(date)\"; done</code>. This requires enabling the HTTP API on the validator client using the flag <code>--http</code>. See the Lighthouse book for more information: <a href=\"https://lighthouse-book.sigmaprime.io/api_vc.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://lighthouse-book.sigmaprime.io/api_vc.html</a>. There is a tracking issue for this bug here: <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" href=\"https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/issues/7403\">#7403</a>.</li>\n<li>The light client server will log <code>ERRO error computing light_client updates LightClientUpdateError(BeaconStateError(IncorrectStateVariant))</code> at the fork until the transition epoch is finalized. This is harmless (albeit annoying) as Lighthouse's light client server is non-essential for validating, and this issue has no negative impact on performance.</li>\n<li>An error log is incorrectly emitted for certain types of invalid attestations received from peers: <code>ERRO Unable to validate attestation error: AttestationValidationError(BeaconStateError(EmptyCommittee))</code>. These attestations are the fault of the peers producing them, but Lighthouse incorrectly assumes an internal fault and does not penalise the peers.

You must also update your execution client (see compatible versions below).</p>\n<p>This release also includes several new features, bug fixes and optimisations.</p>\n<h2>⚠️ Breaking Changes ⚠️</h2>\n<p>You can upgrade to v7.0.0 from any v5 or v6 release. If you are upgrading from v5 you should make sure to <a href=\"https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/releases/tag/v6.0.1\">read the v6 release notes</a> to account for breaking changes between v5 and v6.</p>\n<p>Upgrading to Lighthouse v7.0.0 should require no manual intervention aside from updating the binary or Docker image, as there are no changes to CLI flags that will prevent the node from starting. Mainnet users <strong>must</strong> upgrade before the Electra fork. Failure to upgrade in time will require a re-sync.</p>\n<p>Once you upgrade to Lighthouse v7.0.0, you <strong>can</strong> downgrade to v6, but only prior to the Electra fork.</p>\n<p>See the sections below for details on other backwards-incompatible changes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Deprecated CLI flags</li>\n<li>Minimum supported Rust version</li>\n<li>IPv6 by default</li>\n<li>Gas limit enforcement</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>⚠️ Deprecated CLI Flags ⚠️</h3>\n<p>The following beacon node flags have been deprecated. You should remove them, but the beacon node will still start if they are provided.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>--light-client-server</code></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>🦀 Minimum Supported Rust Version 🦀</h3>\n<p>We have updated the Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) for this release from 1.80.0 to 1.83.0.</p>\n<p><strong>This is only relevant to users compiling Lighthouse from source</strong>.</p>\n<p>You can update your Rust compiler using:</p>\n<div class=\"snippet-clipboard-content notranslate position-relative overflow-auto\"><pre class=\"notranslate\"><code>rustup update stable\n</code></pre></div>\n<h3>IPv6 by Default</h3>\n<p>Lighthouse will now automatically listen on IPv6 if it detects  a globally-routable address. We expect for the majority of users with IPv4-only setups that this change will have no effect, but that it will benefit users with correctly configured IPv6 stacks.</p>\n<p>The default IPv6 listening port has been changed from port 9090 to port 9000 (same as IPv4) to make firewalling easier. The IPv6 port can be adjusted using the flag <code>--port6</code>.</p>\n<p>You can opt-out of IPv6 by using the flag<code>--listen-address 0.0.0.0</code> to only listen on IPv4.</p>\n<p>For more information, see the Lighthouse blog:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://blog.sigmaprime.io/lighthouse-ipv6.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://blog.sigmaprime.io/lighthouse-ipv6.html</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Gas Limit Enforcement</h3>\n<p>Lighthouse BN now enforces gas limit preferences when validating execution payloads from external builders (e.g. <code>mev-boost</code> relays). You can configure the gas limit for all validators connected to a VC using <code>--gas-limit</code>, or set individual limits in the <a href=\"https://lighthouse-book.sigmaprime.io/validator_management.html#introducing-the-validator_definitionsyml-file\" rel=\"nofollow\"><code>validator_definitions.yml</code></a>, or using the <a href=\"https://lighthouse-book.sigmaprime.io/advanced_builders.html#set-gas-limit-via-http\" rel=\"nofollow\">VC HTTP API</a>.</p>\n<h2>⚡ Electra ⚡</h2>\n<p>The <em>Electra</em> hard fork, paired with the <em>Prague</em> hard fork on the execution layer – together known as <em>Pectra</em> – brings several new features to Ethereum.</p>\n<p>The headline change is known as <em>Max EB</em>, and raises the maximum effective balance a single validator may wield from 32 ETH to 2048 ETH. Once adopted, this will allow the network to run more efficiently with a lower validator count, while retaining the same level of security. Max EB even removes some centralisation vectors from staking incentives so that solo validators are able to tap into the compounding rewards previously enjoyed exclusively by large operators.</p>\n<p>The process of switching a validator's max effective balance is a <strong>consolidation</strong>, which transfers stake from one validator to another. Consolidations are triggered via a smart contract call, and are fully opt-in and voluntary. If you are a solo operator with a small number of validators, there is no need to consolidate, although you may choose to do so.</p>\n<p>Information about consolidation tooling has been added to the Lighthouse book:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://lighthouse-book.sigmaprime.io/validator_consolidation.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://lighthouse-book.sigmaprime.io/validator_consolidation.html</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Bugfix for a regression in attestation subscription logic, resolving <code>InsufficientPeers</code> errors.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>New Features</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Electra fork epoch for Gnosis chain.</li>\n<li>Light client server enabled by default.</li>\n<li>Support for a new database backend, <code>redb</code>.

This is harmless and can be safely ignored. These state cache misses will be downgraded to <code>DEBUG</code> level in the next release. In a future release the pruning code will also be adjusted so that these cache misses can't be triggered during pruning (which is the source of the majority of cache misses currently).</p>\n<p>If you are running a node with services connected to the HTTP API (e.g. Rocket Pool rewards generation, a block explorer, etc) we recommend setting a higher value for <code>--state-cache-size</code>, e.g. 128.</p>\n<h2>All Changes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Release v7.0.0 (<a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" href=\"https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/pull/7288\">#7288</a>)</li>\n<li>Merge remote-tracking branch 'origin/stable' into release-v7.0.0</li>\n<li>Release v7.0.0-beta.7 (<a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" href=\"https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/pull/7333\">#7333</a>)</li>\n<li>Update proposer_slashings and attester_slashings amounts for electra.

If you are running on Holesky, <code>v7.0.0-beta.3</code> is recommended instead ⚠️</p>\n<p>💡 Mainnet users can ignore this pre-release.</p>\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>This is a second hot-fix release for the unsuccessful Electra upgrade on Holesky in February 2025. It contains patches to help reduce memory usage during non-finality, and to help nodes sync.</p>\n<p>This release is only for Holesky users. Do not use this version on mainnet, Sepolia, or any other network.</p>\n<p>Please see our informational issue for up-to-date advice on the Holesky situation: <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" href=\"https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/issues/7040\">#7040</a></p>\n<h2>Forced Pseudo-Finalization</h2>\n<p>This release includes an experimental feature to forcefully \"finalize\" a block in Lighthouse's database so that Lighthouse can prune low-quality sidechains, remove finalized states and reclaim disk space. This feature <strong>is not safe</strong> in general, and should not be used except in emergencies.</p>\n<p>Usage of the endpoint requires an <code>epoch</code>, <code>block_root</code> and <code>state_root</code> to pseudo-finalize, which must be from an epoch boundary. Skipped slots are OK, but the <code>state_root</code> must be the <code>state_root</code> of the epoch boundary state.</p>\n<p>An example command to force pseudo-finalization on Holesky is:</p>\n<div class=\"snippet-clipboard-content notranslate position-relative overflow-auto\"><pre class=\"notranslate\"><code>curl -X POST --data '{\"epoch\": \"117400\", \"state_root\": \"0x355fa23c9704fe346362c43a8fe43fba464fe63f20853bd3a87a8f465d52b4f4\", \"block_root\": \"0x06d788e593fd2b5b6fb6dcd63dfa4766201f05d948923dff6865d823246dd3c7\" }' http://localhost:5052/lighthouse/finalize\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>If successful you should see a lot of logs of the form <code>Pruning head</code>, and then after some time (possibly multiple hours if your node knows all of the 800+ Holesky heads), it will complete. Completion is indicated via the debug log <code>DEBG Database consolidation complete</code> (look in <code>$datadir/beacon/logs/beacon.log</code>), and an update to the <code>split</code> field in the <code>/lighthouse/database/info</code> API.</p>\n<p>Compaction will likely run after forced finalization, which is what reclaims the space permanently. If started you will see the log:</p>\n<div class=\"snippet-clipboard-content notranslate position-relative overflow-auto\"><pre class=\"notranslate\"><code>INFO Starting database compaction\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>When it completes (likely after ~1hr), you will see the log:</p>\n<div class=\"snippet-clipboard-content notranslate position-relative overflow-auto\"><pre class=\"notranslate\"><code>INFO Database compaction complete\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>If the finalization completes without compaction, you can trigger a manual compaction using the HTTP API:</p>\n<div class=\"snippet-clipboard-content notranslate position-relative overflow-auto\"><pre class=\"notranslate\"><code>curl -X POST http://localhost:5052/lighthouse/compaction\n</code></pre></div>\n<h2>State Cache Tweaks</h2>\n<p>We've tweaked how old states interact with the state cache, removing several paths for state cache misses, and bad state cache interactions caused by <code>BlocksByRange</code> requests, sidechains and attestations to ancient blocks.</p>\n<p>All of these optimisations are automatic and require no action from users to benefit. If you are feeling adventurous we've also found some benefit from using a new flag <code>--state-cache-headroom 8</code>, which prunes the state cache more aggressively (removing 8 states) when it gets full.</p>\n<p>You may notice backtraces present in the <code>State cache missed</code> logs. These are harmless and do not indicate a fatal error. We added them to aid in debugging.</p>\n<h2>New HTTP endpoint <code>lighthouse/add_peer</code> to add trusted peer</h2>\n<p>This endpoint allows users to add a trusted peer to the peer database and dials it every heartbeat in case it gracefully disconnects. This is useful if the node struggles to find peers on the canonical chain. This can be used together with the <code>--disable-discovery</code> flag to limit the peers the node dials to speed up syncing to the right chain.</p>\n<p>An example command to add a trusted peer:</p>\n<div class=\"snippet-clipboard-content notranslate position-relative overflow-auto\"><pre class=\"notranslate\" lang=\"bash!\"><code>curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" --data '{\"enr\": \"enr:-Le4QLoE1wFHSlGcm48a9ZESb_MRLqPPu6G0vHqu4MaUcQNDHS69tsy-zkN0K6pglyzX8m24mkb-LtBcbjAYdP1uxm4BhGV0aDKQabfZdAQBcAAAAQAAAAAAAIJpZIJ2NIJpcIQ5gR6Wg2lwNpAgAUHQBwEQAAAAAAAAADR-iXNlY3AyNTZrMaEDPMSNdcL92uNIyCsS177Z6KTXlbZakQqxv3aQcWawNXeDdWRwgiMohHVkcDaCI4I\"}' http://localhost:5052/lighthouse/add_peer\n</code></pre></div>\n<h2>⚠️ Breaking Changes ⚠️</h2>\n<p>You should only upgrade to v7.0.0-beta.2 from <code>v7.0.0-beta.{0,1}</code> on Holesky.

Slot <a href=\"https://holesky.beaconcha.in/slot/3710976\" rel=\"nofollow\">3710976</a>.</li>\n<li>Electra on Sepolia: <strong>Wed 5 Mar 2025</strong> 07:29:36 UTC. Slot <a href=\"https://sepolia.beaconcha.in/slot/7118848\" rel=\"nofollow\">7118848</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you are running Lighthouse on a testnet, <strong>you must also upgrade your execution layer client</strong> to a Prague-Electra (<em>Pectra</em>) compatible release.</p>\n<p>The Electra upgrade has not yet been scheduled on mainnet, so <strong>no action is required for mainnet users</strong> (do not upgrade).</p>\n<p>Notable changes in Lighthouse v7.0.0-beta.0 include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>IPv6 enabled by default when a globally-routable IPv6 address is configured.</li>\n<li>Light client server enabled by default.</li>\n<li>Bugfix for a regression in attestation subscription logic.</li>\n<li>Support for a new database backend, <code>redb</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>⚠️ Breaking Changes ⚠️</h2>\n<p>You can upgrade to v7.0.0-beta.0 from any v5 or v6 release. If you are upgrading from v5 you should make sure to <a href=\"https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/releases/tag/v6.0.1\">read the v6 release notes</a> to account for breaking changes between v5 and v6.</p>\n<p>Upgrading to Lighthouse v7.0.0-beta.0 should be automatic for all users, as there are no changes to CLI flags that will prevent the node from starting. Holesky and Sepolia users <strong>must</strong> upgrade before the Electra fork. Failure to upgrade in time will require a re-sync.</p>\n<p>Once you upgrade to Lighthouse v7.0.0-beta.0, you <strong>can</strong> downgrade to v6, but only prior to the Electra fork.</p>\n<h3>⚠️ Deprecated CLI Flags ⚠️</h3>\n<p>The following <strong>beacon node</strong> flags have been deprecated. You should remove them, but the beacon node will still start if they are provided.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>--light-client-server</code></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>IPv6 by Default</h3>\n<p>Lighthouse will now automatically listen on IPv6 if it detects  a globally-routable address. We expect for the majority of users with IPv4-only setups that this change will have no effect, but that it will benefit users with correctly configured IPv6 stacks.</p>\n<p>The default IPv6 listening port has been changed from port 9090 to port 9000 (same as IPv4) to make firewalling easier. The IPv6 port can be adjusted using the flag <code>--port6</code>.</p>\n<p>You can opt-out of IPv6 by using the flag <code>--listen-address 0.0.0.0</code> to only listen on IPv4.</p>\n<p>For more information, see the implementation PR:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" href=\"https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/pull/6808\">#6808</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>🦀 Minimum Supported Rust Version 🦀</h3>\n<p>We have updated the Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) for this release from 1.80.0 to 1.83.0.</p>\n<p><strong>This is only relevant to users compiling Lighthouse from source</strong>.</p>\n<p>You can update your Rust compiler using:</p>\n<div class=\"snippet-clipboard-content notranslate position-relative overflow-auto\"><pre class=\"notranslate\"><code>rustup update stable\n</code></pre></div>\n<h2>⚡ Electra ⚡</h2>\n<p>The <em>Electra</em> hard fork, paired with the <em>Prague</em> hard fork on the execution layer – together known as <em>Pectra</em> – brings several new features to Ethereum.</p>\n<p>The headline change is known as <em>Max EB</em>, and raises the maximum effective balance a single validator may wield from 32 ETH to 2048 ETH. Once adopted, this will allow the network to run more efficiently with a lower validator count, while retaining the same level of security. Max EB even removes some centralisation vectors from staking incentives so that solo validators are able to tap into the compounding rewards previously enjoyed exclusively by large operators.</p>\n<p>The process of switching a validator's max effective balance is a <strong>consolidation</strong>, which transfers stake from one validator to another. Consolidations are triggered via a smart contract call, and are fully opt-in and voluntary. If you are a solo operator with a small number of validators, there is no need to consolidate, although you may choose to do so.</p>\n<p>We expect the tooling and documentation for consolidations to mature as Electra on mainnet approaches. We have plans of our own to update the Lighthouse UI (Siren) with consolidation support, and will make an announcement when that is ready.</p>\n<h2>Light Client Server</h2>\n<p>We have enabled the Light Client Server by default 🎉. Our implementation has reached a stage of maturity and performance where we feel comfortable rolling it out by default. It should result in negligible changes to bandwidth, CPU usage,  memory and disk I/O for users.</p>\n<p>The light client protocol allows very lightweight clients and devices to interact with Ethereum, and we are excited to see how the ecosystem evolves with more widespread protocol support.</p>\n<p>You can opt-out of the light client server using <code>--disable-light-client-server</code>.</p>\n<h2>Attestation Subscription Fix</h2>\n<p>A fix was made to the beacon node's attestation subscription logic which could lead to under-subscription and issues publishing aggregate attestations. This has been addressed in the following PR:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" href=\"https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/pull/6890\">#6890</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>New Database Backends</h2>\n<p>A new database backend is available in the form of <a href=\"https://github.com/cberner/redb\"><code>redb</code></a>. This is a pure-Rust database, with nice ACID properties. We hope to modernise and optimise our database usage around <code>redb</code> in the coming months.</p>\n<p>For now, <code>redb</code> is performing slightly worse than LevelDB for some operations, and is only recommended for expert users and tinkerers. You can opt-in using <code>--beacon-node-backend redb</code>. This won't make use of any existing LevelDB database, nor will it delete it, so you should delete your LevelDB database manually and then checkpoint sync if you would like to switch.</p>\n<h2>🐛 Known Issues 🐛</h2>\n<p>There are no known issues at the time of writing.</p>\n<h2>Update Priority</h2>\n<p>This table provides priorities for which classes of users should update particular components.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th align=\"left\">User Class</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Beacon Node</th>\n<th>Validator Client</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">Staking Users (testnet)</td>\n<td align=\"left\">High</td>\n<td>High</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">Non-Staking Users (testnet)</td>\n<td align=\"left\">High</td>\n<td>---</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">Staking Users (mainnet)</td>\n<td align=\"left\">DON'T UPDATE</td>\n<td>DON'T UPDATE</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">Non-Staking Users (mainnet)</td>\n<td align=\"left\">DON'T UPDATE</td>\n<td>---</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><em>See <a href=\"https://lighthouse-book.sigmaprime.io/installation-priorities.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Update Priorities</a> for more information about this table.</em></p>\n<p>Testnet users should update both the Lighthouse VC and BN to v7.0.0-beta.0 if using separate binaries.

These underlying GC options can be tweaked separately if necessary. Note this is the same flag used to activate the online pruner, but it will have no effect if you've already used the offline prune command.</p>\n<h3>Extra <code>prune-pre-merge-blocks</code> options</h3>\n<p><code>--threads</code> will default to one less than the number of processors available on your system, so it is safe to omit<br />\n<code>--prune-range-size</code> will default to 10000 and can be adjusted if desired, although this may impact performance of the prune</p>\n<p>e.g. <code>./besu --network=sepolia --data-path=/path/to/your/database --Xhistory-expiry-prune storage prune-pre-merge-blocks --threads=4 --prune-range-size=10000</code></p>\n<h2>How to perform an online prune</h2>\n<p>An alternative option for pruning is online pruning, which can be tuned to minimise impact on a running besu system</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-shell notranslate position-relative overflow-auto\"><pre>./besu --network=sepolia --Xhistory-expiry-prune</pre></div>\n<p><code>--Xhistory-expiry-prune</code> will enable online pruning of pre-merge blocks and print progress in the logs, e.g.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Pruned pre-merge blocks up to 380000</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When online prune is complete you will see this log message</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Done pruning pre-merge blocks.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Note, <code>--Xhistory-expiry-prune</code> doubles up as a way to activate online pruning as well as the garbage collection settings that works for both online and offline pruning mechanisms.</p>\n<h3>Extra options</h3>\n<p><code>--Xpre-merge-pruning-quantity=100</code> is the default value and will tune the online pruning to remove 100 blocks from the beginning of the chain for every new block added. During testing on a 4 CPU machine, values up to 100 had neglible impact on besu's normal functioning.</p>\n<h2>Sync without pre-merge blocks</h2>\n<p>The final option for avoiding storage of pre-merge blocks is to delete your database and perform a fresh SNAP sync with the <code>--Xsnapsync-synchronizer-pre-merge-headers-only-enabled</code> option, e.g.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-shell notranslate position-relative overflow-auto\"><pre>./besu --network=sepolia --sync-mode=SNAP --Xsnapsync-synchronizer-pre-merge-headers-only-enabled</pre></div>\n<p>Consider using RocketPool's <a href=\"https://rescuenode.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://rescuenode.com</a> to minimise downtime if you're a solo staker (LSTs like Lido CSM should talk to the RocketPool grants committee).</p>\n<h2>Eth/69</h2>\n<p>Alongside pre-merge history expiry, <a href=\"https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7642\" rel=\"nofollow\">EIP-7642</a> adds the Eth/69 protocol which broadcasts the new earliest block in the <code>STATUS</code> message. This can be enabled by starting besu with the <code>--Xeth-capability-max=69</code> option. This usually defaults to allow all available protocol versions, but is currently defaulting to 68 to prevent unwanted Eth/69 activation.</p>\n<p>This is optional and not required for history expiry sync or prune.</p>\n<h2>Further notes</h2>\n<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>\n<p>Some of the same cli command troubleshooting tips may apply to <code>prune-pre-merge-blocks</code>: <a href=\"https://besu.hyperledger.org/public-networks/how-to/bonsai-limit-trie-logs#troubleshoot\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://besu.hyperledger.org/public-networks/how-to/bonsai-limit-trie-logs#troubleshoot</a></p>\n<h3><code>sync-mode=CHECKPOINT</code></h3>\n<p>Some users may have <code>sync-mode=CHECKPOINT</code> instead of <code>SNAP</code>. Nothing will break however if you perform a fresh sync then you will delete the <em>full</em> pre-merge blocks instead of retaining the headers.<br />\nOnce history expiry is live, we advise everyone to migrate from <code>CHECKPOINT</code> -&gt; <code>SNAP</code> and will be deprecating <code>CHECKPOINT</code> sync in the future.</p>\n<h3>Mainnet readiness</h3>\n<div class=\"markdown-alert markdown-alert-caution\"><p class=\"markdown-alert-title\"><svg class=\"octicon octicon-stop mr-2\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M4.47.22A.749.749 0 0 1 5 0h6c.199 0 .389.079.53.22l4.25 4.25c.141.14.22.331.22.53v6a.749.749 0 0 1-.22.53l-4.25 4.25A.749.749 0 0 1 11 16H5a.749.749 0 0 1-.53-.22L.22 11.53A.749.749 0 0 1 0 11V5c0-.199.079-.389.22-.53Zm.84 1.28L1.5 5.31v5.38l3.81 3.81h5.38l3.81-3.81V5.31L10.69 1.5ZM8 4a.75.75 0 0 1 .75.75v3.5a.75.75 0 0 1-1.5 0v-3.5A.75.75 0 0 1 8 4Zm0 8a1 1 0 1 1 0-2 1 1 0 0 1 0 2Z\"></path></svg>Caution</p><p>This is <strong>NOT</strong> a Mainnet-ready release</p>\n</div>\n<p>Once Sepolia testing is complete, we will release a mainnet-ready version of history expiry for Besu.

Log indexing operations can sometimes block log queries, we have observed anywhere from 5s to 2m on Arbitrum One during log tail unindexing, which happens about once a day with arb1 traffic levels.

In particular, the Tracing system fixes the <code>slotsMissed_int</code> metric, while networking improvements include Windows socket fixes, reduced caching time of DNS lookup errors, refined <code>PeerSharing</code> configuration behavior (see networking changes below for details), and the deprecation of <code>--non-producer-node</code> in favor of <code>--start-as-non-producer-node</code> command line switch for starting the node. This release also removes a number of irrelevant binaries from the Node artifacts and adds <code>tx-generator</code>.</p>\n<p>Benchmarking reports relevant to the <code>10.5.1</code> release can be found in <a href=\"https://updates.cardano.intersectmbo.org/reports/2025-07-performance-10.5.0\" rel=\"nofollow\">this post</a> on <strong>Cardano Updates</strong>.</p>\n<p>System testing results for the <code>10.5.1</code> release can be found on the corresponding <a href=\"https://tests.cardano.intersectmbo.org/test_results/node/tag_10_5_1.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">tag testing page</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Please note the changed default behavior for <code>PeerSharing</code> for relay nodes, but not for block producers.  This reflects the recommendations for mainnet usage -- mainnet block producers may not meet the Praos performance guarantees if <code>PeerSharing</code> is enabled and IP will also be leaked, but this is not an issue for relays.</strong></p>\n<h1>Known issues</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>There is a known bug when starting from a Byron snapshot. The node will reject the snapshot and replay the chain from the start. However the time it takes to replay the Byron era is small, and very few users are expected to need to start the node from a Byron snapshot. Therefore the issue will be fixed in 10.6.0.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Technical Specification</h1>\n<details open=\"\">\n  Minimum System Requirements\n<ul>\n<li>An Intel or AMD x86 processor with two or more cores, at 1.6GHz or faster (2GHz or faster for a stake pool or relay)</li>\n<li>Or, for MacOS, an Apple Silicon (M1, M2, M3 or M4) processor</li>\n<li>24GB of RAM when running with the <code>InMemory</code> backend, 8GB when running with the <code>OnDisk</code> backend (pending confirmation)</li>\n<li>300GB of free storage (350GB recommended for future growth)</li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<details>\n  Platforms\n<ul>\n<li>Linux 64-bit (Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, 22.04 LTS, 24.04 LTS;

The Node now exposes an LMDB <code>MaxReaders</code> configuration option, while Consensus includes optimizations for Ouroboros Genesis, drops GHC 8.10 support, and removes deprecated features such as <code>SlotForgeTimeOracle</code>. Network changes reduce the default peer connection targets, add configurable egress buffering, and fix synchronisation issues. The Cardano Node CLI standardizes JSON/YAML outputs, enables offline Plutus cost calculations, and removes legacy commands.

UTxO-HD is a rework of the Consensus layer of the node which allows the UTxO set to be stored either fully in-memory (as with previous node versions) or else on some external storage medium (e.g. SSD or HD).  The latter lowers the memory requirements of the running node at the cost of some speed. This first version of UTxO-HD provides an <a href=\"http://www.lmdb.tech/doc/\" rel=\"nofollow\">LMDB</a> backend, but future releases will incorporate a more fine-tailored backend based on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-structured_merge-tree\" rel=\"nofollow\">LSM trees</a>. More information on UTxO-HD can be found <a href=\"https://ouroboros-consensus.cardano.intersectmbo.org/docs/for-developers/utxo-hd/Overview\" rel=\"nofollow\">in the consensus website</a>.</p>\n<p>This release also provides fixes and enhancements to the tracing system, to the location of LedgerDB configuration options, and to the node CLI and API. It also updates the dependency on Plutus to 1.45.</p>\n<p>System testing results for the 10.4.1 release can be found on the corresponding <a href=\"https://tests.cardano.intersectmbo.org/test_results/node/tag_10_4_1.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">tag testing page</a>.</p>\n<p>Benchmarking reports relevant to the <code>10.4.1</code> release can be found in <a href=\"https://updates.cardano.intersectmbo.org/reports/2025-05-performance-10.4.1\" rel=\"nofollow\">this post</a> on <strong>Cardano Updates</strong>.</p>\n<div class=\"markdown-alert markdown-alert-important\"><p class=\"markdown-alert-title\"><svg class=\"octicon octicon-report mr-2\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M0 1.75C0 .784.784 0 1.75 0h12.5C15.216 0 16 .784 16 1.75v9.5A1.75 1.75 0 0 1 14.25 13H8.06l-2.573 2.573A1.458 1.458 0 0 1 3 14.543V13H1.75A1.75 1.75 0 0 1 0 11.25Zm1.75-.25a.25.25 0 0 0-.25.25v9.5c0 .138.112.25.25.25h2a.75.75 0 0 1 .75.75v2.19l2.72-2.72a.749.749 0 0 1 .53-.22h6.5a.25.25 0 0 0 .25-.25v-9.5a.25.25 0 0 0-.25-.25Zm7 2.25v2.5a.75.75 0 0 1-1.5 0v-2.5a.75.75 0 0 1 1.5 0ZM9 9a1 1 0 1 1-2 0 1 1 0 0 1 2 0Z\"></path></svg>Important</p><p>Users migrating from a previous version of the node should read <a href=\"https://ouroboros-consensus.cardano.intersectmbo.org/docs/for-developers/utxo-hd/migrating\" rel=\"nofollow\">the migration guide</a> to properly configure the node and convert the database such that a replay from genesis can be avoided.

While it may provide sufficient performance for edge nodes (wallets, explorers, exchanges etc.) at a valuable reduction in memory usage, it should not be used for block producer or relay nodes on mainnet.</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Known Issues</h2>\n<p>There is a known bug with the experimental Ouroboros Genesis feature that is not yet recommended for mainnet use.<br />\nChainSync Jumping (CSJ) is not disabled once a node is caught up. This should not affect normal operation of the syncing node, but does risk a DoS attack for the caught-up node. It will be corrected in a future release (Issue <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" href=\"https://github.com/IntersectMBO/ouroboros-consensus/issues/1490\">IntersectMBO/ouroboros-consensus#1490</a>).</p>\n<p>There is also a known bug when starting from a Byron snapshot. The node will reject the snapshot and replay the chain from the start. However the time it takes to replay byron is small, and the chance of users starting the node from a Byron snapshot is also low. Therefore the issue will be fixed in 10.6.0.</p>\n<h1>Technical Specification</h1>\n<details open=\"\">\n  Minimum System Requirements\n<ul>\n<li>An Intel or AMD x86 processor with two or more cores, at 1.6GHz or faster (2GHz or faster for a stake pool or relay)</li>\n<li>Or, for MacOS, an Apple Silicon (M1, M2, M3 or M4) processor</li>\n<li>24GB of RAM when running with the InMemory backend, 8GB when running with the OnDisk backend (pending confirmation)</li>\n<li>300GB of free storage (350GB recommended for future growth)</li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<details>\n  Platforms\n<ul>\n<li>Linux 64-bit (Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, 20.04 LTS, 22.04 LTS; Mint 19.3, 20; Debian 10.3)</li>\n<li>Windows 64-bit (8.1, 10, 11)</li>\n<li>MacOS 10.13, 10.14, 10.15, 11</li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<details open=\"\">\n  GHC/Cabal supported versions\n<ul>\n<li>GHC 9.6</li>\n<li>Cabal 3.8/3.12</li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<details>\n  Supported roles\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Platform</th>\n<th align=\"center\">Block Production</th>\n<th align=\"center\">Relay</th>\n<th align=\"center\">Client (Desktop)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Linux</td>\n<td align=\"center\">🟢</td>\n<td align=\"center\">🟢</td>\n<td align=\"center\">🟢</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Windows</td>\n<td align=\"center\">🟥</td>\n<td align=\"center\">🟥</td>\n<td align=\"center\">🟢</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>MacOS</td>\n<td align=\"center\">🟥</td>\n<td align=\"center\">🟥</td>\n<td align=\"center\">🟢</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</details>\n<details open=\"\">\n  Downloads\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://book.play.dev.cardano.org/environments.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Release configuration files</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-node/pkgs/container/cardano-node/405336126?tag=10.4.1\">Docker image</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<h1>Documentation</h1>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.cardano.org/cardano-components/cardano-node\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cardano Node documentation</a>\n<ul>\n<li>For details about changes to configuration for <code>UTxO-HD</code> please refer to the <a href=\"https://ouroboros-consensus.cardano.intersectmbo.org/docs/for-developers/utxo-hd/Overview\" rel=\"nofollow\">Consensus docs on UTxO-HD</a></li>\n<li>The <a href=\"https://developers.cardano.org/docs/get-started/\" rel=\"nofollow\">getting started guide</a> may also be helpful for general queries.</li>\n<li>Networking options and related changes are listed on the <a href=\"https://developers.cardano.org/docs/get-started/cardano-node/p2p/\" rel=\"nofollow\">P2P section</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-cli/tree/cardano-cli-10.8.0.0\">Cardano CLI</a></li>\n<li>Internal API docs for <a href=\"https://cardano-ledger.cardano.intersectmbo.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">ledger</a>, <a href=\"https://ouroboros-consensus.cardano.intersectmbo.org/haddocks/\" rel=\"nofollow\">consensus</a> and <a href=\"https://ouroboros-network.cardano.intersectmbo.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">network</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.cardano.org/developer-resources/release-notes/comp-matrix\" rel=\"nofollow\">Compatibility matrix</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Sign-off</h1>\n\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Role</th>\n<th align=\"center\">Approval</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Technical Steering Committee (Intersect)</td>\n<td align=\"center\">🟢</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Product Committee (Intersect)</td>\n<td align=\"center\">🟢</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Test Engineer</td>\n<td align=\"center\">🟢</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Performance Engineer</td>\n<td align=\"center\">🟢</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Site Reliability Engineer</td>\n<td align=\"center\">🟢</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Release Engineer</td>\n<td align=\"center\">🟢</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<details>\n  Legend\n<ul>\n<li>🟢 - signed / agreed / supported</li>\n<li>🟥 - not agreed / unsupported</li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<h1>Changelogs</h1>\n<details>\n  Node\n<ul>\n<li>Relocate configuration options related to the LedgerDB under a new <code>\"LedgerDB\"</code> key in the configuration file.

In addition, it provides several enhancements to the new tracing system. It also provides support for light-weight checkpointing that is needed to enable <code>ouroboros-genesis</code>.  Finally, it includes bug-fixes for a number of CLI commands. The docker images for <code>node</code> and <code>submit-api</code> have also received improvements to streamline operations.</p>\n<p>System testing results for the <code>10.3.1</code> release can be found on the corresponding <a href=\"https://tests.cardano.intersectmbo.org/test_results/node/tag_10_3_1.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">tag testing page</a>.</p>\n<p>Benchmarking reports relevant to the <code>10.3.1</code> release can be found in <a href=\"https://updates.cardano.intersectmbo.org/reports/2025-04-performance-10.3.1\" rel=\"nofollow\">this post</a> on <strong>Cardano Updates</strong>.</p>\n<h2>Known Issues</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>New tracing system: <code>connectionManager_*</code> metrics are incorrect; the underlying trace message <code>ConnectionManagerCounters</code> however logs the correct values.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>New tracing system: <code>slotsMissed</code> metric is incorrect; it falsely counts slots since the most recent block production as missed. However, the block producer does not actually miss a slot.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>GenesisMode: the optional <code>peerSnapshotFile</code> declaration in the topology file interprets relative paths with respect to node's binary directory rather than the topology file directory.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>There is a known bug with the experimental Ouroboros Genesis feature that is not yet recommended for mainnet use.<br />\nChainSync Jumping (CSJ) is not disabled once a node is caught up. This should not affect normal operation of the syncing node, but does risk a DoS attack for the caught-up node. It will be corrected in a future release (Issue <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" href=\"https://github.com/IntersectMBO/ouroboros-consensus/issues/1490\">IntersectMBO/ouroboros-consensus#1490</a>).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Technical Specification</h1>\n<details open=\"\">\n  Minimum System Requirements\n<ul>\n<li>An Intel or AMD x86 processor with two or more cores, at 1.6GHz or faster (2GHz or faster for a stake pool or relay)</li>\n<li>Or, for MacOS, an Apple Silicon (M1, M2, M3 or M4) processor</li>\n<li>24GB of RAM</li>\n<li>200GB of free storage (250GB recommended for future growth)</li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<details>\n  Platforms\n<ul>\n<li>Linux 64-bit (Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, 20.04 LTS, 22.04 LTS;

It also places responsibility on the social networks to prevent children from accessing &quot;harmful materials&quot; and it requires parental consent for minors to use any social media. NetChoice represents several tech companies — including social media platforms Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and YouTube — and it sued to block the law on grounds that it violates the First Amendment. A district court ruled in favor of NetChoice, but the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals lifted its temporary block.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Although Justice Brett Kavanaugh denied the application to vacate stay on the appeals court ruling, he also wrote that &quot;NetChoice has, in my view, demonstrated that it is likely to succeed on the merits—namely, that enforcement of the Mississippi law would likely violate its members' First Amendment rights under this Court’s precedents.&quot; He denied the application because NetChoice &quot;has not sufficiently demonstrated that the balance of harms and equities favors it at this time.&quot; This decision means that, at least for now, Mississippi's law will be allowed to stand.</p>\n<p>&quot;Justice Kavanaugh’s concurrence makes clear that NetChoice will ultimately succeed in defending the First Amendment,&quot; <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://netchoice.org/netchoice-confident-the-first-amendment-will-prevail-against-mississippis-i-d-for-speech-law/\">said</a> Paul Taske, co-director of the NetChoice Litigation Center. &quot;This is merely an unfortunate procedural delay.&quot;</p>\n<p>There are several other state laws being assessed at various points in the US legal system.

The key to this is a new case featuring what the company is calling the industry's first patented Cryo Chamber, which puts the PC's liquid-cooled radiator in a separate compartment to prevent hot air from spreading and impacting the rest of the system's thermals. With this arrangement, HP says it was able to reduce temperatures by up to 7.5 degrees Celsius at full load. Meanwhile, thanks to smaller touches like raised feet, vented PCI slots and open vents on the bottom of the case, HP was able to improve GPU temps by another two degrees C.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>But to me, the best thing about the Omen Max 45L is that HP says it's using industry-standard components across the board instead of proprietary parts and fittings like we sometimes see in pre-built systems from major vendors. This means that down the line, if you want to replace or upgrade a specific component, you'll be able to do just that instead of potentially needing to replace the entire computer. And if that isn't enough, the Omen comes with a CPU cooler that has a small built-in display that you can load up with practically any image or short video clip.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, the desktop comes with a fully modular power supply (with up to 1,200 watts), which is a first for the Omen line. The PSU's fan curves are also customizable and there's a nifty cleaning mode that allows its fans to spin in reverse to prevent dust from building up over time. Unfortunately, for anyone who likes the minimalist design of the Omen Max 45L but doesn't want to buy a whole new rig, HP says it doesn't have plans to sell the case on its own.</p>\n<p>Naturally, as the beefiest desktop in HP's gaming desktop family, the Omen Max 45L can be configured with top-of-the-line components including up to an AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D processor, an NVIDIA RTX 5090 GPU, 128GB of DDR5 RAM and 2TB of PCIe Gen5 storage.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"The HyperX Cloud Alpha 2 is HP's latest top-tier wireless gaming headset.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-08/888c67b0-7921-11f0-b39f-f6ea965d9639\" style=\"height: 2000px; width: 3333px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Rutherford for Engadget</div></figure>\n<p>Aside from the Omen Max 45L, HP also has a bunch of refreshed PC gaming peripherals on the way, headlined by the $300 HyperX Cloud Alpha 2 wireless headset. Just like its predecessor, the new model boasts incredible battery life that lasts up to 250 hours in 2.4GHz mode, 53mm drivers and support for dual audio inputs via Bluetooth. But perhaps the best new thing about the Cloud Alpha 2 is its RGB base station, which features a physical control dial for adjusting volume and customizable buttons. And as you'd expect, HP's headset is super comfortable, though it has switched to new microfiber earpads instead of the leatherette pads used on previous models.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, for anyone on a tighter budget there are also two versions of the new HyperX Cloud Flight 2 wireless headset ($130 for the PC/PlayStation version or $140 for the Xbox variant) that come with RGB lighting and removable side panels for extra personalization.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"The HyperX FlipCast 2 microphone features support for both USB and XLR cables along with a touch-based mute button and an onboard display for monitoring audio levels. \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-08/cd2549a0-7921-11f0-a9f7-d811e16048dd\" style=\"height: 2000px; width: 3333px;\" /><figcaption>The HyperX FlipCast 2 microphone features support for both USB and XLR cables along with a touch-based mute button and an onboard display for monitoring audio levels. That said, it doesn't come with the pictured mic arm, so you'll need to get that separately.&nbsp;</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Rutherford for Engadget</div></figure>\n<p>Finally, for folks in the market for a new desktop mic, HP has two offerings there as well: the $230 HyperX FlipCast and the $60 SoloCast 2. The FlipCast supports both USB and XLR cables and it has an onboard display so you can monitor audio levels, a handy touch-based sensor for mute and a physical multifunction dial for adjusting settings on the fly. Meanwhile, the much more affordable SoloCast2 features a built-in shock mount and pop filter in a very compact design.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"For just $60, the HyperX SoloCast 2 microphone offers a built-in shock mount and pop filter in a compact design. \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-08/ac6fdfe0-7921-11f0-9ae3-c47d3ed66d1a\" style=\"height: 2000px; width: 3333px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Rutherford for Engadget</div></figure>\n<p>Sadly, the Omen Max 45L  and the HyperX CloudX Flight 2 headset won't be available until the end of the year in December.

When enabled, the chatbot would, following a question, try to guide the user to their own solution, instead of providing them with an answer outright. Since its introduction in April, learning mode has only been available to Claude for Education users. Now, like OpenAI did with <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/chatgpts-study-mode-will-guide-students-to-an-answer-stey-by-step-180614172.html\">Study Mode</a>, Anthropic is making the tool available to everyone.</p>\n<p>Starting today, <a href=\"http://claude.ai/\">Claude.ai</a> users will find a new option within the style dropdown menu titled &quot;Learning.&quot; The experience here is similar to the one Anthropic offers with <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/introducing-claude-for-education\">Claude for Education</a>. When you turn learning mode on, the chatbot will employ a Socratic approach, trying to guide you through your question. However, unlike the real-life Socrates, who was famous for bombarding strangers with endless questions, you can turn off learning mode at any time.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Notably, Anthropic is also offering two different takes on the feature through <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code\">Claude Code</a>. First, there's an &quot;Explanatory&quot; mode where Claude will generate summaries of its decision-making process as it works, giving the user a chance to better understand what it's doing.</p>\n<p>For those at the start of their coding career or hobby, there's also a more robust option, which is once again called &quot;Learning.&quot; Here, Claude will occasionally stop what it's doing and mark a section with a &quot;#TODO&quot; comment to prompt the user to write five to 10 lines of their code. If you want to try the two features out for yourself, update to the latest version of Claude Code and type &quot;/output-styles.&quot; You can then select between the two modes or Claude's default behavior.</p>\n<p>According to Drew Bent, education lead at Anthropic, learning mode, particularly as it exists in Claude Code, is the company's attempt to make its chatbot into more of a collaborative tool. &quot;I think it's great that there's a race between all of the AI labs to offer the best learning mode,&quot; he said. &quot;In a similar way, I hope we can inspire something similar with coding agents.&quot;</p>\n<p>Bent says the original learning mode came out of conversations Anthropic had with university students, who kept referring back to the concept of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_rot\">brain rot</a>. &quot;We found that they themselves realized that when they just copy and paste something directly from a chat bot, it's not good for their long-term learning,&quot; he said. When it came time to adapt the feature to Claude Code, the company wanted to balance the needs of new programmers with those like Bent who have been coding for a decade or more.</p>\n<p>&quot;Learning mode is designed to help all of those audiences not just complete tasks, but also help them grow and learn in the process and better understand their code base,&quot; Bent said. His hope is that the new tools will allow any coder to become a &quot;really good engineering manager.&quot; In practice, that means those users won't necessarily write most of the code on a project, but they will develop a keen eye for how everything fits together and what sections of code might need some more work.</p>\n<p>Looking forward, Bent says Anthropic doesn't &quot;have all the answers, but needless to say, we're trying to think through other features we can build&quot; that expand on what it's doing with learning mode. To that end, the company is opening up Claude Code's new Output Styles to developers, allowing them to build their own learning modes. Users too can modify how Claude communicates by <a href=\"https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/10181068-configuring-and-using-styles\">creating their own custom prompts for the chatbot</a>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/anthropic-brings-claudes-learning-mode-to-regular-users-and-devs-170018471.html?src=rss"}

Gamescom is the planet's largest gaming event and we're sure to find out about a bunch of interesting new games at the Opening Night Live showcase (and, fingers crossed, maybe get a <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong </em>release date?). Xbox is broadcasting from the show floor across two days, and there will be other presentations that are worth keeping an eye on.</p>\n<p>Gamescom is taking place between August 20 and 24 this year, and we're learning bits and pieces about what to expect from the various showcases. The affair will kick off with Opening Night Live, a showcase hosted by Geoff Keighley that bridges the gap between his two other major events, Summer Game Fest Live and The Game Awards. That will be followed by two days of Xbox broadcasts, the latest edition of the Future Games Show and three days of Bethesda streams.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>There will also be news from Ubisoft on what's next for <em>The Division 2</em>. The company will <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://x.com/Ubisoft/status/1955638110798201174\">host two panels</a> related to the franchise during Gamescom. One will include more info about <em>The Division Resurgence</em> (<a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ubisoft-delays-its-rainbow-six-and-division-mobile-games-until-at-least-april-2025-174035060.html\">a delayed mobile game</a>), as well details about a \"big Division 2 project.\"</p>\n<p>We'll update this preview with more Gamescom details as we get them, and embed video versions of each stream as they become available too. Here's our breakdown of how to watch Gamescom 2025 and what to expect from the event.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-gamescom-schedule\">Gamescom schedule</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Opening Night Live — August 19, 1:30PM ET (pre-show), 2PM (main show)</p></li>\n<li><p>Xbox @ gamescom 2025 Broadcast — August 20, 9AM ET</p></li>\n<li><p>Future Games Show — August 20, 2PM ET</p></li>\n<li><p>Xbox @ gamescom 2025 Broadcast — August 21, 9AM ET</p></li>\n<li><p>Bethesda — August 22-25</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-how-to-watch-gamescom-opening-night-live---august-19-2pm\"><strong>How to watch Gamescom Opening Night Live - August 19, 2PM ET</strong></h2>\n<p><strong>Watch on </strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@gamescom.global/\"><strong>YouTube</strong></a></p>\n<p>Opening Night Live perhaps won't feature as many heavy hitters as Summer Game Fest Live or The Game Awards typically have, but one thing's for certain: Call of Duty fans will definitely want to tune in. The two-hour showcase will feature the \"worldwide reveal\" of <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. </em>We'll almost certainly get a release date here too.</p>\n<p>Given that Microsoft has said <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong </em>will be playable on PC and ROG Xbox Ally X at its Gamescom booth, and the game is still slated to arrive this year, this event seems as good a time as any for us to finally get a release date for that thing — <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/that-one-time-i-played-hollow-knight-silksong-160022483.html\">over six years after we first got to try it out</a>. There will certainly be more eyeballs on ONL than Microsoft's own streams, so that seems like the likeliest bet for any concrete <em>Silksong </em>news at Gamescom.</p>\n<p>You can also expect a trailer for multiplayer RPG <em>Honor of Kings: World, </em>along with <a href=\"https://www.gematsu.com/event/gamescom-2025-opening-night-live\">new looks</a> at <em>Resident Evil Requiem, Silent Hill f, Ninja Gaiden 4, Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion</em> and<em> The Seven Deadly Sins: Origin. </em>You'll get to see the opening cinematic for <em>World of Warcraft</em>'s <em>Midnight</em> expansion as well.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It won't all be game reveals and announcements, though — there'll be a performance of music from <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 </em>featuring composer Lorien Testard and vocalist Alice Duport-Percier. Additionally, you'll get a peek at season two of Prime Video's <em>Fallout </em>series, which will arrive in December.</p>\n<p>We'll be keeping tabs on all the news from Opening Night Live right here on Engadget. Myself, senior editor Jess Conditt and editor-in-chief Aaron Souppouris will be live-blogging our way through ONL. Join us!

(Think about it this way: Would you actually feel safe running Windows XP, a notoriously malware-prone OS that hasn't received a significant security update since 2019, today? I would hope not!)</p>\n<p>So what's a Windows 10 user to do? Let's consider your choices.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-the-best-option-upgrade-to-windows-11\">The best option: Upgrade to Windows 11</h2>\n<p>For most users, the simplest way to move on from Windows 10 is to step up to Microsoft's new OS. <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/windows-11-review-microsoft-mindful-os-200028040-200028741.html\">Windows 11 </a>is a free upgrade for Windows 10 users running the latest 22HS update and who also meet the <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=67071605-d4df-494e-8d9c-c9c236b8bb38&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=1ef2905f-b731-403b-8357-0ea175334b36&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Microsoft&amp;linkText=minimum+hardware+specifications&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5taWNyb3NvZnQuY29tL2VuLXVzL3dpbmRvd3Mvd2luZG93cy0xMS1zcGVjaWZpY2F0aW9ucyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMWVmMjkwNWYtYjczMS00MDNiLTgzNTctMGVhMTc1MzM0YjM2Iiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5taWNyb3NvZnQuY29tL2VuLXVzL3dpbmRvd3Mvd2luZG93cy0xMS1zcGVjaWZpY2F0aW9ucyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAVxHGHrs91w2Kpanl0rPvDovVCqJRYlzrn120q64n5Be&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fwindows%2Fwindows-11-specifications\">minimum hardware specifications</a>. Microsoft isn't asking for much — just a 1 GHz dual-core 64-bit processor, 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage -— but security requirements may be a problem for very old PCs.

Windows 11 relies on the latter for biometric logins, BitLocker data encryption and other security features. If you don't have TPM 2.0, you'll be stuck with Windows 10 until you get a new PC.</p>\n<p>If that all sounds too complicated, <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=1ef2905f-b731-403b-8357-0ea175334b36&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;linkText=Microsoft%27s+PC+Health+Check+app&amp;custData=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&amp;signature=AQAAAUWLMYFxh16drbFAk3euOpr1NYoouaJEY8y0BsGJi6Hu&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fwindows%2Fcheck-if-a-device-meets-windows-11-system-requirements-after-changing-device-hardware-f3bc0aeb-6884-41a1-ab57-88258df6812b\">Microsoft's PC Health Check app</a> can also let you know if your system is ready for Windows 11. And if you've been bombarded by Windows 11 upgrade notifications over the past few years, that's also a not-so-subtle nudge that your PC is likely ready for the new OS. (There are various hacks that can let you install Windows 11 without TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot, but they’re risky and could make your OS installation vulnerable.)</p>\n<p>If you do choose to upgrade, you can expect a relatively painless process. Gone are the days when a Windows upgrade could easily wipe out your entire system. Now you can expect all of your software (and their respective licenses) to carry over, but with yet another caveat for Office suites: Microsoft is also <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365-apps/end-of-support/resources\">ending support for Office 2016 and Office 2019</a> on October 14, 2025 as well. Cloud-based Microsoft 365 apps should be good to go on Windows 11 as well (see below for Windows 10 limitations).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Assuming you've got enough hard drive space to hold the new OS, the upgrade process is merely a matter of sitting back and watching your system reboot a few times. I'd still recommend backing up any essential data before upgrading, though, just in case you run into any issues. (Pairing a cloud-based Microsoft OneDrive backup with a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-portable-ssd-120043652.html\">local hard disk</a> is a good belt and suspenders solution.)</p>\n<div id=\"62e45afdb5c4410a974b97d393ddcbc1\"></div>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-the-pricey-option-buy-a-new-pc\">The pricey option: Buy a new PC</h2>\n<p>If your system is too old to support Secure Boot mode and TPM 2.0, it’s probably just time for an upgrade. (Expert users can find workarounds on YouTube and elsewhere, but you need to be adventurous enough to handle the likes of Github downloads and security overrides.)

While the sweetspot for new PCs tends to be in the $750 to $1,200 range, with current back-to-school promos, you can find very capable laptops and desktops for as low as $500, and occasionally less. But if you're looking for something higher end ($1,400 and up), our <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/best-gaming-laptops-172033838.html\">best gaming laptop guide</a> would be helpful.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-the-risky-option-keep-on-trucking-with-windows-10\">The risky option: Keep on trucking with Windows 10</h2>\n<p>Windows 10 won't self-destruct when its support ends, so you could conceivably just use your older PC until it dies. But that's a risky option since you won't be getting any security updates. All it takes is for one intrepid hacker to find a new security flaw and you could easily fall victim to any number of issues. That includes getting malware, which could slow down performance and leak your data to hackers, or falling victim to a ransomware data theft scheme. And every day past October 14 just raises the likelihood of OS-level vulnerabilities that third-party antivirus software would be ill-equipped to fight off. Trust me – you don't want to do this. At the very least, buy yourself another year to figure things out</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-the-procrastinator-option-pay-to-extend-windows-10s-security-updates\">The procrastinator option: Extend Windows 10's security updates for one year&nbsp;</h2>\n<p>If your hardware can't support the move to Windows 11, you can at least hit the snooze button by subscribing to the Windows 10 extended update (ESU) program. While it was initially announced as a $30 offering, Microsoft has since made it a free option if you <a href=\"https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2025/06/24/stay-secure-with-windows-11-copilot-pcs-and-windows-365-before-support-ends-for-windows-10/\">synchronize your Windows 10 settings</a> to the cloud via Windows Backup, or you could shell out <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/windows-10-users-can-get-extended-security-updates-for-1000-microsoft-rewards-points-170023129.html\">1,000 Microsoft reward points</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As its name implies, the ESU will get you Windows 10 security updates, bug fixes and technical support until October 13, 2026. It also extends support for cloud-based <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365-apps/end-of-support/windows-10-support\">Microsoft 365 apps</a> through August 2026 for individuals and families. Sure, it's only a year of additional support, but that can at least buy you enough time to do more research on a new PC, or wait for a holiday sale. For what it's worth, this marks the first time Microsoft has offered any sort of ESU to consumers. Typically, they're just a way for corporate IT admins to get additional support without migrating to a new OS.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-have-a-tech-question-youd-like-engadget-to-answer\">Have a tech question you’d like Engadget to answer?</h2>\n<p>As tech reporters, the Engadget staff is always answering questions from friends and family about electronics, software, gaming, big tech policies and more.

That was my immediate thought when the company announced its first drone, the A1, from a spin-off brand and team called <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cameras/insta360-spin-off-antigravity-360-degree-video-drone-130048742.html\">Antigravity</a>.</p>\n<p>So, what is the A1? Is it an entry-level device? A camera for creators looking to spice up their videos without years of practice? A competitive POV drone? It’s a bit of all three, but the Antigravity A1 isn’t just a drone. It will eventually launch in a three-part set: the flying unit, OLED Vision goggles and a dedicated Grip motion controller.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>In its current form, the Antigravity A1 weighs around 249 grams (8.8 ounces), which helps it duck around drone license requirements in most regions. (As it’s a preproduction model, this could change a little before it hits retail.) Two ultrawide cameras are positioned on the roof and underside of the drone instead of on the front. It’s like the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cameras/insta360-x5-launch-date-price-hands-on-132439941.html\">Insta360 X5 camera</a> is some sort of cocoon for the Antigravity A1.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Antigravity A1 drone hands-on\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-08/909afc20-7848-11f0-bfdf-530bdf9d71aa\" style=\"height: 1288px; width: 2289px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Image by Mat Smith for Engadget</div></figure>\n<p>With those two camera units, the A1 can capture video in 8K resolution, stretched across a sphere-like canvas from the drone’s point of view. With stitching algorithms that the company has continually improved over five generations of 360-degree cameras, this should result in mostly seamless footage where the A1 never interrupts the view.  The drone itself won’t show up in your video. It’s like the company’s “invisible” selfie stick, but, well, up in the sky.</p>\n<p>The A1 is unlike any other drone I’ve played with — something I learned when I tested a pre-production unit at a Mercedes-Benz race track in Schlüsselfeld, Germany. Naturally, this included high-speed cars, wet conditions and some near-misses.</p>\n<p>Thanks to working at Engadget, I’m a drone dabbler, but Antigravity’s A1 is a different experience from the outset. Controlling the A1 involves strapping on companion goggles and steering it from a first-person perspective, controller in hand. However, unlike other FPV drones, you can look (and move) anywhere you want.</p>\n<div id=\"2224f835e99b412aaf1848c3de7b61da\"></div>\n<p>During roughly 15 minutes of flying time (you can see the highlights here), I found it’s a surprisingly intuitive experience. With other FPV drones, your view is locked to the direction of the camera. Sure, you can rotate rival drones to see elsewhere, like with <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cameras/dji-avata-2-fpv-drone-review-a-cheaper-more-potent-tool-for-creators-130052278.html\">DJI’s Avata</a>, but it’s not the same. Because the A1 streams 360-degree video to the goggles, turning your head will never affect the direction it’s facing. Instead, you’ll just see what’s around the drone as it flies, making it far more intuitive for rookie drone pilots. Better still, you can strafe and move around while looking somewhere else — like video game controls for a first-person shooter.</p>\n<p>This freedom of movement is elevated by the unique A1 controller, which is best described as a blend between a traditional drone controller and a Wiimote. While some of the physical buttons and dials adjust altitude, start/stop video recording and more, steering involves a point-and-click method. When you move your hand out to the right side, a reticle shows up on the goggles’ display. Pressing the trigger then will cause the A1 to shoot out in that direction, an action that Antigravity calls Freemotion control.</p>\n<p>As I mentioned, this means I don’t have to look where I’m going — although it’s better if I do to avoid accidents (or collisions with an expensive Mercedes). If you’ve been intrigued by FPV drones, this is a simpler experience that feels freer, too. You can look wherever you want, not beholden to where cameras are pointed on other drones. I also think I could get friends and family flying the A1 around with minimal training. Speaking of spectators, Insta360 included a clever touch for them: the goggles have an external screen so that onlookers can see what’s happening. There is nothing duller than watching someone else fly a drone without being able to see their POV.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Antigravity A1 drone hands-on\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-08/909ad510-7848-11f0-af5d-8ffc14cca897\" style=\"height: 1153px; width: 2050px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Image by Mat Smith for Engadget</div></figure>\n<p>The A1 is a zippy little drone, presumably thanks to its low weight. But even at this preproduction stage, the resulting video looks better than I thought it would. Plus, it offers substantial versatility if you’re looking for action-packed shots.</p>\n<p>After I tested the A1, Antigravity sent me my video from the drone, so I was about to reframe, crop and reposition the footage. You could even use the same 10 seconds and frame (or crop) to three very different angles. For example, you could extract a tracking shot of the car, a zoomed-in shot of the drone pilot or just the blue skies of Germany all from one clip. That’s the exciting part here.</p>\n<p>Insta360 built excellent editing tools (mobile and desktop) for its cameras in the past, and it plans to do the same for its first drone. An early version of the software wasn’t without its hiccups, but editing was easy enough once I figured out that keyframes would anchor the drone's view. I could then add several keyframes together, tagging objects I’d like to keep in frame or track. Editing my footage started to get oddly enjoyable, and I have <em>never</em> enjoyed that task.</p>\n<p>Another feature the company emphasized is payload detection. While the exact weight limit is still being refined through further testing, Antigravity says the A1 won’t be able to fly if the drone detects it’s carrying something it shouldn’t — a move to further smooth potential license issues. The company also hinted at future accessories and peripherals to expand the A1 experience — something it has successfully done with its action cams and gimbals.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Antigravity A1 drone hands-on\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-08/909afc21-7848-11f0-bb7f-27f1814bb63c\" style=\"height: 1294px; width: 2300px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Image by Mat Smith for Engadget</div></figure>\n<p>Some specs are still a mystery because the drone is a work in progress. To that end, the company is <a href=\"http://www.antigravity.tech/\">opening up applications</a> for a co-creation project, where participants will get a pre-production Antigravity A1 in exchange for offering feedback. Ideas from these testers will be integrated into the final retail version, and the best ones could win a share of a $20,000 prize pool.</p>\n<p>Flying the A1 around a racetrack was the most fun I've had with a drone in a long time. But, with goggles and a dedicated controller included, how much will a flight cost? That might decide whether Insta360’s Antigravity can carve out a place next to DJI’s army of drones.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cameras/insta360-antigravity-a1-drone-preview-hands-on-130034274.html?src=rss"}

This iPad occupies the position of \"best for most\" in our<a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/best-ipads-how-to-pick-the-best-apple-tablet-for-you-150054066.html\"> iPad buying guide</a>, reinforcing that goldilocks analogy. The M3 chip is the main draw here, with Geekbench 6 scores proclaiming it around 16 percent more powerful than the M2 iPad Air, which is no slouch itself.</p> \n<p>Beyond the chip, it has a superior display and speakers to the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/ipad-2025-with-a16-review-no-apple-intelligence-no-problem-132641539.html\">entry-level model</a>, and wider accessory support. You also get the option of a 13-inch display, which is great for artists or anyone who sees the iPad as a viable laptop replacement.</p> \n<p>If there’s an obvious downside to the iPad Air M3, it’s that it doesn't have the nice 120Hz OLED display of the iPad Pro. This is hardly surprising, as Apple often focuses on display tech to differentiate its Pro and non-Pro devices, but it’s probably time the refresh rate on the middle-of-the-road iPad at least jumped up to ProMotion. Face ID is long overdue too. If you can live with these caveats, though, the iPad Air is an excellent option, particularly at this price.</p> \n<p>There are a couple of other iPads on sale at Amazon right now, too, if you think the Air is too much for your needs.

You can also get real-time translation in 13 languages: Arabic, Traditional Chinese, English, French, German, Greek, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese, Spanish, Korean, Thai, Turkish.</p>\n<p>On the audio side, the Vive Eagle has an open-ear setup that &quot;combines large acoustic drivers and virtual bass enhancement to deliver rich, spatial audio while minimizing sound leakage,&quot; HTC said. It promised that you'll be able to hear music or voice prompts without others overhearing, while still being aware of your surroundings.</p>\n<div id=\"6c6a99d6b65d422e987095aa97aa73c9\"><div style=\"width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"></div></div>\n<p>HTC promises up to 36 hours of standby time and 4.5 hours of continuous music playback thanks to the 235mAh battery, and you can get to a 50 percent charge (via magnetic fast charging) in just 10 minutes. It also features a &quot;privacy-first&quot; architecture with all video and other data stored exclusively on-device — and that is protected via 256-bit AES encryption, according to HTC.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Vive Eagle will only available in Taiwan at first for NT$15,600, or about $520 — quite a bit more than most of Meta's Ray-Ban models.

The zoom lens could <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/25/iphone-17-pro-max-48mp-telephoto/\">jump</a> to 48MP, which would strengthen its digital zooming / cropping chops.

The company is also expected to roll out new Apple Watch models. 5G and a processor upgrade are <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-10/apple-plans-apple-watch-ultra-3-next-year-with-satellite-texting-and-5g\">expected</a> for the Apple Watch Ultra 3. It may also let you send texts via satellite, handy for those who use it out in the wilderness. Regardless of the details, Apple hasn't launched a new rugged and premium model since 2023 (apart from <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/wearables/theres-no-apple-watch-ultra-series-3-just-a-new-color-and-a-new-band-173236966.html\">a new color</a>), so it's due for an upgrade.</p>\n<p>The Series 11 model is unlikely to depart dramatically from the Series 10. After all, that model introduced a new design, with a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/wearables/apple-watch-series-10-review-legacy-and-sequel-in-equal-measure-120021405.html\">thinner body and larger screen</a>. (And Apple has historically kept those around in three-year cycles.). But a faster chip also seems logical. Perhaps we'll see 5G arrive on the standard wearable, too.</p>\n<p>We may also see the AirPods Pro 3 at the event. It's been about three years since Apple last upgraded its premium earbuds. The new model could also bring some <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/apples-next-airpods-pro-could-offer-heart-rate-and-temperature-monitoring-175757188.html\">biometric sensors to the earphones</a>: an in-ear heart-rate monitor and (maybe) temperature sensing. <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/apples-rumored-live-translation-feature-for-airpods-could-be-coming-with-ios-26-152715034.html\">Live translation is also rumored</a>, although that may not be exclusive to the third-gen model.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/what-to-expect-at-apples-iphone-17-event-090059189.html?src=rss"}

Whether you want a lightweight device to binge your favorite shows, a larger screen for mobile gaming or a portable way to get some work done on the go, a tablet can do it all. They’re also great for keeping kids entertained, managing work tasks or sharing family moments through video calls. When a phone feels too small and lugging around a laptop is just too much, that’s where tablets fit into the mix.<br /><br />For many, the Apple iPad is the go-to choice, and it’s easy to see why with its smooth performance and endless app options. But don’t worry if iOS isn’t your thing — there are plenty of Android alternatives out there, offering the same level of flexibility without locking you into Apple’s ecosystem. Plus, if you’re on a budget, there are more affordable options that still pack a punch. Whether you’re looking for a premium tablet for work, a kid-friendly device with parental controls or just a reliable everyday companion, we’ve tested all of the big players (and many others) to find the best tablets worth your money right now.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-table-of-contents\">Table of contents</h2> \n<ul> \n <li><p><a href=\"#jump-link-best-tablets-for-2025\">Best tablets for 2025</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"#jump-link-important-things-to-consider-before-buying-a-tablet\">Important things to consider before buying a tablet</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"#jump-link-how-we-test-tablets\">How we test tablets</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"#jump-link-other-tablets-we-tested\">Other tablets we tested</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"#jump-link-tablet-faqs\">Tablet FAQs</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"#jump-link-tablet-accessories\">Tablet accessories</a></p></li> \n</ul> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-best-tablets-for-2025\">Best tablets for 2025</h2> \n<p> </p> \n<p> </p> \n<p> </p> \n<p> </p> \n<p> </p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-important-things-to-consider-before-buying-a-tablet\">Important things to consider before buying a tablet</h2> \n<p>Before you start looking at specific devices, the number one thing you should do is figure out what you plan to use your new tablet for. That’s because if all you need is something to keep a kid busy, buying a brand new Apple iPad Air or iPad Pro doesn’t make a ton of sense. On the flip side, if you want to use a tablet for video editing or drawing, you’ll need to take things like performance, versatility and stylus support more seriously — especially if you're considering using it as a laptop replacement.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span> \n<p>You’ll also want to think about stuff like how often you plan on traveling with the device and if it’s more for productivity, or for less demanding stuff like web browsing or streaming shows. There’s also an important trade-off to consider when it comes to battery life as well. Larger devices tend to have longer runtimes, though an increase in size may make it less portable.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-how-we-test-tablets\">How we test tablets</h2> \n<p>When evaluating different tablets, there are a few important things we look for above all else: solid performance, a good screen and long battery life. For performance, we run a handful of synthetic tests like Geekbench 6, while also performing a number of hands-on, real-world use cases such as editing photos and playing games. And with tablets often serving as hybrid devices, we also consider how easy it is to multitask and switch quickly between various apps. The more responsive a device feels, the better.</p> \n<p>Because a tablet’s display is such a critical component, we also view a wide range of content to gauge things like brightness, color gamut and dynamic range. It’s important to take into account the difference between various panel types like OLED, which typically produce richer colors and excellent contrast but may not be as bright as a mini LED display. Recently, refresh rate has become an increasingly important spec as 90Hz and 120Hz screens can make scrolling smoother and graphics appear sharper in games.</p> \n<p>We also consider a tablet’s design (including things like size, weight and water resistance), its connectivity (WiFi, Bluetooth, NFC, 5G, et cetera) and special features like stylus support or the ability to serve as a secondary display. That’s because, while tablets were often viewed as content consumption devices in the past, higher-end devices like the Surface Pro and iPad Pro are more than capable of <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/the-best-2-in-1-laptops-for-2023-155052641.html\">replacing a laptop</a> for a lot of people.</p> \n<p>Finally, we test battery life by running our standard local video rundown test, which involves playing a single video on a loop from 100 percent until it runs out of juice. Ideally, a tablet should be able to last an entire working day, but longer runtimes are always welcome — especially for users relying on them for productivity, entertainment and storage options on the go.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-other-tablets-we-tested\">Other tablets we tested</h2> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-apple-ipad-mini\">Apple iPad mini</h3> \n<p>Apple updated the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/ipad-mini-7-review-safe-boring-and-everything-i-want-in-a-small-tablet-130039378.html\">iPad mini</a> for 2024 with some under-the-hood changes including a new processor and additional RAM to help support Apple Intelligence features. While the iPad mini is one of the best iPads you can buy, its small size makes it a bit niche. Only if you prefer your tablet be the size of an ereader should you consider this one.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-google-pixel-tablet\">Google Pixel Tablet</h3> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-tablet-review-clever-accessories-transform-an-unexciting-tablet-070147119.html\">Google Pixel Tablet</a> excels as a smart display rather than a simple tablet. As the latter, it's unexciting, but when paired with its speaker/charging dock, it becomes much more useful. It could be a good option for those that already live within the Google ecosystem and use the Google Assistant often, or those who like the idea of a tablet that can be docked and used as a smart display as well.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-oneplus-pad\">OnePlus Pad</h3> \n<p>The solid <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/oneplus-pad-review-solid-hardware-thats-let-down-by-android-130039695.html\">OnePlus Pad</a> is let down by Android because there aren't many Android apps designed to be used on a large display like this model's 11.6-inch panel. Otherwise, the hardware is well-designed, its companion stylus is comfortable to use and it has an excellent battery life.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-tablet-faqs\">Tablet FAQs</h2> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-what-is-the-best-brand-for-tablets\">What is the best brand for tablets?</h3> \n<p>The best brand for tablets is really the brand you feel most comfortable with. We recommend taking stock of the gadgets you already have — do you live in the Apple ecosystem already? An iPad might be best for you then. Do you have a Samsung phone? If so, a Galaxy Tab will likely be the most convenient choice. There is no one \"best brand\" for tablets; you’ll find good options made by companies including Apple, Google, Samsung, Microsoft and Amazon.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-can-a-tablet-replace-a-laptop\">Can a tablet replace a laptop?</h3> \n<p>It’s possible for a tablet to replace a laptop, but you’ll need a few accessories to truly make the experience as close as possible to that of a traditional notebook. A keyboard is a must, be it a keyboard case or a Bluetooth accessory that you keep with you. Some keyboard cases, like apple’s Magic Keyboard for the iPad, have a built-in trackpad, which will be more ergonomic than tapping on your tablet’s screen for input. Additionally, you could go one step further and use a wireless mouse that connects via Bluetooth to your tablet. If you’re primarily looking for a tablet to replace your laptop, consider buying a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/the-best-2-in-1-laptops-for-2023-155052641.html\">2-in-1 laptop</a> since those systems typically consist of high-powered tablets that are designed to work well with (and without) keyboards.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-what-size-screen-do-i-need\">What size screen do I need?</h3> \n<p>Figuring out the best screen size for you will also be related to the kind of work (or play) you intend to do. Larger screens make it much easier to view two apps side by side, and big screens also deliver a more immersive movie viewing experience — especially when paired with an OLED display or Liquid Retina display. But at the same time, the larger the tablet, the less likely you’re going to want to move it around. That means you’re not only going to want to take stock of your workspace (i.e., if you have a desk or instead plan to work from a couch or even your bed), but you’re also going to want to think about how the device will fit into your everyday routine or commute (if you have one).</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-tablet-accessories\">Tablet accessories</h2> \n<p>Finally, you’ll want to consider any add-ons or accessories you’re planning to use, which can range from detachable keyboards to things like external mics or a stylus. The good news is that many of the best tablets nowadays offer some kind of keyboard accessory, which allows the device to function more like a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-2-in-1-laptops-173038508.html\">2-in-1</a> instead of simply being a content consumption device. Some tablets also feature things like microSD card slots that support expandable storage, or optional 4G or 5G connectivity, which can be a real boon to frequent travelers. And if you’re planning to use the tablet mainly for work, you might want to grab a USB hub for connecting all your favorite peripherals so your devices don’t have to fight for the charger.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-recent-updates\">Recent updates</h2> \n<p><strong>July 2025:</strong> Updated to ensure our top picks and buying advice remain accurate.</p> \n<p><strong>May 2025:</strong> Updated to ensure our top picks and buying advice remain accurate.</p> \n<p><strong>March 2025:</strong> Updated to include the latest base iPad in our top picks,</p> \n<p><strong>February 2025:</strong> Updated to include clarification around our top picks and new buying advice.</p> \n<p><strong>October 2024:</strong> We updated this list to include information on the new iPad mini 7.</p> \n<p><strong>June 2024:</strong> We updated our top picks to include the Microsoft Surface Pro Copilot+ edition.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/best-tablets-150026056.html?src=rss"}

Until then, you can <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/how-to-install-the-ios-26-public-beta-171117199.html\">download and install</a> the newly released public beta 2 (or <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ios-ipados-release-notes/ios-ipados-26-release-notes\">iOS 26 developer beta 6</a> for developers). During Apple's recent earnings call, CEO Tim Cook said its collection of upcoming beta operating systems (including iOS) are \"by far the most popular developer betas we’ve had,\" <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2025/08/01/tim-cook-ios-26-is-by-far-apples-most-popular-beta-ever/\"><em>9to5Mac </em>reports</a>. You can also take a look at our <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ios-26-beta-preview-liquid-glass-is-better-than-you-think-172155402.html\">preview of the iOS 26 public beta release</a>, which shows off the fresh home and lock screen redesign. Called <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apples-new-liquid-glass-design-is-its-biggest-visual-update-in-years-172158766.html\">Liquid Glass</a>, the new translucent look will extend across all of Apple's upcoming operating systems. The overhaul is one of several big changes coming to iOS, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/macos-26-beta-preview-spotlights-time-to-shine-171700779.html\">macOS</a>, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/ipados-26-preview-a-long-awaited-multi-tasking-update-pays-off-so-far-172522054.html\">iPadOS</a> and the rest of Apple's software suite, all of which were showcased during the company's <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/wwdc-2025-everything-apple-announced-including-ios-26-liquid-glass-design-and-more-171718030.html\">WWDC keynote</a> on June 9.</p>\n<p>After overpromising on AI plans last year, Apple kept its iOS roadmap focused more on basic quality of life improvements this year. There are multiple useful additions coming to the Phone and Messages apps on your iPhone, for instance: Apple execs outlined the ability to weed out spam texts or other unknown senders and an option to hold your spot on a phone call when you've been waiting for a representative to pick up. Plus, a treasured feature that we took for granted is coming back (hint: it's in the Photos app).</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Siri, meanwhile, is in a holding pattern. Apple has previously specified that its smarter voice assistant — first promised at WWDC 2024 — is delayed until some point \"<a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/apple-is-delaying-its-smarter-more-personal-siri-183513424.html\">in the coming year</a>,\" so you shouldn't expect any major changes in the current betas. But there are reports that Apple is aiming to give Siri a bigger brain transplant by <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/30/apple-chatgpt-claude-siri/\">basing it on third-party artificial intelligence models</a> like OpenAI's ChatGPT or Anthropic's Claude, which could make 2026 a pivotal year. The company is also reportedly working on a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/apple-reportedly-has-a-stripped-down-ai-chatbot-to-compete-with-chatgpt-in-the-works-164345473.html\">'stripped-down' AI chatbot</a> to rival ChatGPT.</p>\n<p>With each beta, it seems like additional new improvements are popping up, like this <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/apples-rumored-live-translation-feature-for-airpods-could-be-coming-with-ios-26-152715034.html\">new AirPods gesture</a> we're all curious about, and this FaceTime feature that'll <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/ios-26-can-freeze-your-facetime-video-if-it-detects-nudity-135329941.html\">freeze your video if it detects nudity</a>. With the release of the <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ios-ipados-release-notes/ios-ipados-26-release-notes\">iOS 26 developer beta 5</a>, we saw more added features, like a new bouncy animation on the passcode screen and in the Control Center, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/05/ios-26-beta-5-features/\"><em>MacRumors </em>reports</a>. Some or all of those changes will likely soon migrate into the separate public beta (see below). Most newer iPhone models are <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/apple-is-releasing-ios-26-this-fall-heres-the-full-list-of-compatible-iphones-191854795.html\">eligible to download iOS 26 </a>(both the betas and final version). Want to see the full list of new features coming this fall? Read on.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-what-is-ios-26\">What is iOS 26?</h2>\n<p>The current iPhone operating system is iOS 18, and Apple is still actively updating it — <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-18-6-features/\">version 18.6</a> was just recently released. But don't expect to see iOS 19. Instead, Apple is skipping the numbering ahead to iOS 26 later this year. The company has decided to line up its iOS version numbers with a year-based system, similar to car model years. So while iOS and its sibling operating systems will be released in late 2025, they're all designated \"26\" to reflect the year ahead.&nbsp;</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"a list of the new OSes\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-06/29bbb6f0-4555-11f0-b2de-ada42a83075d\" style=\"height: 1080px; width: 1920px;\" /><figcaption>It's official, we're moving to iOS 26. (Apple)</figcaption></figure>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-what-is-liquid-glass-design\">What is Liquid Glass design?</h2>\n<p>Let's be honest. Out of everything announced at WWDC this year, the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apples-new-liquid-glass-design-is-its-biggest-visual-update-in-years-172158766.html\">new Liquid Glass design</a> was the star of the show. The iPhone's home and lock screens have looked pretty much the same year after year — the last exciting thing (in my opinion) was the option to add your own aesthetic to your home screen by customizing your apps and widgets. So seeing the home and lock screens' new facelift is refreshing.</p>\n<p>So what exactly is Liquid Glass? Apple calls it a \"<a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=4130e2f0-a14f-4c5e-bdab-cd52ac7d8e79&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=86b7b54f-7ccd-4fbb-a927-09c327b93cbc&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Apple&amp;linkText=new+translucent+material&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hcHBsZS5jb20vbmV3c3Jvb20vMjAyNS8wNi9hcHBsZS1lbGV2YXRlcy10aGUtaXBob25lLWV4cGVyaWVuY2Utd2l0aC1pb3MtMjYvIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI4NmI3YjU0Zi03Y2NkLTRmYmItYTkyNy0wOWMzMjdiOTNjYmMiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFwcGxlLmNvbS9uZXdzcm9vbS8yMDI1LzA2L2FwcGxlLWVsZXZhdGVzLXRoZS1pcGhvbmUtZXhwZXJpZW5jZS13aXRoLWlvcy0yNi8ifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAVivyXXsD7DiKwA3X-v-YLSp-mKPz8KpUrb1ctVS4Hji&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2025%2F06%2Fapple-elevates-the-iphone-experience-with-ios-26%2F\">new translucent material</a>\" since, well, the apps and widgets are clear. However, the screen can still adapt to dark and light modes, depending on surroundings. You'll also notice buttons with a new floating design in several apps, like Phone and Maps. They're designed to be less distracting than the current buttons, but are still easy to see. While the design overhaul has proven to be controversial since its announcement, some — including Engadget's own Devindra Hardawar — like the new direction, even if it's somewhat reminiscent of <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/apples-liquid-glass-is-windows-vista-done-well-181954910.html\">Microsoft's translucent Windows Vista Aero designs</a> from nearly twenty years ago.</p>\n<p>That said, as of the release of the iOS 26 beta 2, Apple <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/apple-read-your-mean-tweets-about-liquid-glass-and-finder-222230726.html\">has already incorporated some user feedback</a> into the design, dialing back the transparency in at least some places. And while it will continue to evolve, Apple users won't be able to escape it: Liquid Glass was designed to make all of Apple's OSes more cohesive. Here's a look at how the translucent aesthetic will look with <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/macos-tahoe-26-will-bring-apples-new-liquid-glass-ui-to-your-desktop-174149070.html\">the new macOS Tahoe 26</a> on your desktop.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-what-are-the-new-and-notable-features-of-ios-26\">What are the new and notable features of iOS 26?</h2>\n<p>iOS 26 has a laundry list of new features. Among the most worthwhile:</p>\n<p><strong>Phone app redesign:</strong> You'll finally be able to scroll through contacts, recent calls and voicemail messages all on one screen. It also comes with a new feature called Hold Assist that'll notify you when an agent comes to the phone so you can avoid the elevator music and continue on with other tasks.</p>\n<p><strong>Live Translation in Phone, FaceTime and Messages:</strong> iOS 26 is bringing the ability to have a conversation via phone call or text message with someone who speaks another language. Live Translation will translate your conversation in real time, which results in some stop-and-go interactions in the examples Apple shared during its presentation.</p>\n<p><strong>Polls in group chats:</strong> Tired of sorting through what seems like hundreds of messages in your group chat? You and your friends will soon be able to create polls in group messages for deciding things like which brunch spot you're eating at or whose car you're taking on a road trip.</p>\n<p><strong>Filtering unknown senders in Messages:</strong> If you haven't received spam texts about unpaid tolls or other citations, you're lucky. For those of us who have, those annoying messages will soon be filtered away in a separate folder.</p>\n<p><strong>Visual Intelligence:</strong> Similar to a reverse Google image search, this new feature will allow you to search for anything that's on your iPhone screen. For instance, if you spot a pair of shoes someone is wearing in an Instagram photo, you can <a href=\"https://tech.yahoo.com/phones/article/how-to-take-a-screenshot-on-your-iphone-133139822.html\">screenshot it and use Visual Intelligence</a> to find those shoes (or similar ones) online.</p>\n<p><strong>Photos tabs are back:</strong> For anyone who's still frustrated with the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/how-apple-redesigned-its-photos-app-around-customization-120038901.html\">Photos changes made last year</a>, you'll be happy to know that your tabs are coming back. Library and Collections will have their own separate spaces so you don't have to scroll to infinity to find what you're looking for.</p>\n<p><strong>FaceTime \"Communication Safety\" feature: </strong>A newer addition to iOS 26 appears to be the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/ios-26-can-freeze-your-facetime-video-if-it-detects-nudity-135329941.html\">FaceTime \"Communication Safety\" feature</a> that pauses communications if and when nudity is detected. The feature appears to be a child safety feature that uses on-device detection, thus obviating any cloud-based privacy issues.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://tech.yahoo.com/phones/article/how-to-customize-your-iphones-lock-screen-on-ios-26-110535863.html\"><strong>New lock screen options</strong></a><strong>: </strong>The iPhone lock screen gets more customizable in iOS 26, with a cooler clock, 3D wallpaper effects, more widgets and better focus mode options.&nbsp;</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"New Hold Assist being displayed at the wwdc keynote\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-06/a506ddc0-4556-11f0-9d7a-9a93e6a181c1\" style=\"height: 1080px; width: 1920px;\" /><figcaption>Apple's Hold Assist will be nifty for those pesky services that put you on hold for 10 or more minutes.

Here's what's coming this fall.</p>\n<p><strong>Multitasking and real windowing:</strong> When you download the newest update, you'll be able to have multiple apps running on your screen at the same time. Once you open an app, it'll appear on your screen as normal but you'll be able to resize and move it across your screen to make room for other apps. This feature is optional so you can turn it off if you don't like it.</p>\n<p><strong>Visual update:</strong> Along with the other new OSes, iPadOS 26 is coming with the Liquid Glass aesthetic. This new look will appear on the lock and home screens, as well as the drop-down menus.</p>\n<p><strong>New menu bar:</strong> When you swipe down on your screen, the new menu bar will appear with options like File, Edit, Windows and more. There's also a search option if you're looking for something specific.</p>\n<p>Check out our <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/ipados-26-preview-a-long-awaited-multi-tasking-update-pays-off-so-far-172522054.html\">first impressions of iPadOS 26</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-what-about-airpods\">What about AirPods?</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/ios-26-updates-for-airpods-preview-enhanced-audio-recording-camera-remote-and-more-173036046.html\">AirPods are also getting updated</a> with iOS 26. Here are some of the more notable functions.</p>\n<p><strong>Enhanced audio recording:</strong> Apple calls this \"studio-quality\" audio recording, and with it, you'll notice more clarity while in noisy environments.</p>\n<p><strong>Camera remote control:</strong> Using this, you can take a photo or start and stop video recording with just one press on your AirPods. When taking photos, you'll get a three-second countdown before your iPhone or iPad snaps the picture.</p>\n<p><strong>Live translation feature:</strong> While not officially announced or confirmed, it appears that the long-rumored live translation for AirPods <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/apples-rumored-live-translation-feature-for-airpods-could-be-coming-with-ios-26-152715034.html\">could be coming with iOS 26</a>. The evidence comes from a system asset spotted in the in iOS 26 beta showing a gesture that's triggered by pressing both earbud stems at the same time. The photo also shows words in several different languages.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-which-iphones-will-be-able-to-upgrade-to-ios-26\">Which iPhones will be able to upgrade to iOS 26?</h2>\n<p>A few iPhone models that run the current version of iOS — iPhone XR, XS and XS Max — won't be compatible with the latest upgrade.

The new models will come equipped with the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/ios-26-public-beta-is-available-to-download-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-new-iphone-and-ipad-update-135749331.html?feature=disableNCPValidation\">latest iOS 26 features</a> preinstalled, along with whatever additional features Apple reveals at the launch event. But since we still have to wait a few weeks (presumably) until the iPhone event, we can at least speculate what the new phones will look like. As with most unreleased iPhone models, rumors and leaks have trickled in about the hardware side ahead of the official introduction. Here's what we're expecting and what we can reasonably assume we'll get from Cupertino in September.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-how-much-will-the-iphone-17-cost\">How much will the iPhone 17 cost?</h2>\n<p>Apple's <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/apple-to-invest-another-100-billion-into-the-us-to-avoid-tariffs-210250020.html\">announced plan to expand US-based manufacturing partners</a> seems to give it at least some shielding from the steepest Trump administration tariffs that have already triggered price increases on everything from <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/the-original-nintendo-switch-is-about-to-get-more-expensive-in-the-us-170646701.html\">Switch consoles</a> to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cameras/nikon-joins-other-camera-manufacturers-in-raising-prices-due-to-tariffs-120011854.html\">high-end cameras</a> to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/sonos-is-raising-prices-this-year-to-make-up-for-tariff-expenses-123031336.html\">Sonos speakers</a>. But given that President Trump's trade policies can change from week to week, and Apple's continuing reliance on Asia-based supply chains, price shocks remain an ongoing possibility. The bigger question is: Will Apple absorb any higher costs, or pass them on to consumers?&nbsp;</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>If prices do creep up, Apple may choose to pair it with an &quot;upgrade.&quot; Consider this recent rumor <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/06/will-iphone-17-pro-start-at-256gb-storage/\">posted by <em>MacRumors</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>from a leaker known as &quot;<a href=\"https://weibo.com/u/5143897135\">Instant Digital</a>,&quot; suggesting that the default storage of the iPhone 17 line may start at 256GB, doubling the current 128GB baseline. While that could be accompanied by a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/30/iphone-17-price-increase-expected/\">price increase of $50</a>, Apple could at least pitch it as a &quot;better value.&quot; That said, the company <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/every-macbook-air-now-starts-with-16gb-of-ram-at-no-extra-cost-150041320.html\">doubled the default RAM of its Mac computers</a> from 8GB to 16GB at no extra cost in 2024 — but that was before the current Trump tariff cycle started.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-when-will-the-iphone-17s-be-announced\">When will the iPhone 17 series be announced?</h2>\n<p>Most years, the flagship smartphones are introduced in September. <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/05/apple-iphone-17-event-set-september-9/\"><em>MacRumors </em>highlighted</a> a story originally reported by <a href=\"https://www.iphone-ticker.de/iphone-17-vorstellung-wohl-am-9-verkaufsstart-am-19-september-261445/\">iphone-ticker.de</a> that the Apple iPhone 17 event could be Tuesday, September 9, according to information gleaned from German mobile phone providers.</p>\n<p>It's still too early to have the specific dates; some years, Apple only gives a week or two of lead time between sending invites and hosting the event. But years of past precedent show that sometime in September should be when the 17 models make their debut. This family of smartphones may be the last to follow that trend, however. There have been hints that the introduction of the iPhone 18 collection in 2026 will be <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apple-reportedly-wants-to-split-up-the-iphones-release-schedule-164737099.html\">split</a> into a pro-tier announcement in the fall and a standard model announcement the following spring.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-what-will-the-new-iphone-17-lineup-include\">What will the new iPhone 17 lineup include?</h2>\n<p>Design leaks suggest that Apple is building an <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-is-said-to-be-working-on-a-significantly-thinner-iphone-180823565.html\">ultra-thin smartphone</a>, likely to be named the iPhone 17 Air to match Apple's ultralight laptop designation. <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman, often a solid source of advanced intel about Apple, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/this-year-could-bring-the-iphone-air-and-an-entry-level-ipad-with-apple-intelligence-175059162.html\">reported</a> in January that the iPhone 17 Air will be equipped with a basic A19 chip and will only have a single camera lens. It may also use Apple's new in-house modem, which was introduced in February on the <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-16e-review-whats-your-acceptable-compromise-020016288.html\">iPhone 16e</a>. More details about this development may leak ahead of September, but that's what we know for now.</p>\n<p>An investor note from Apple analyst Jeff Pu <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/15/iphone-17-air-titanium-rumor/\">indicated</a> that the Air will have a titanium frame. If his reports are accurate, the lightweight smartphone will be the only entry in the iPhone 17 lineup to use that metal; the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max are expected to be made of aluminum, which is oddly a lighter material than titanium. Other speculation had suggested that the Air would use a blend of aluminum and titanium, so the exact materials may not be known until the official announcement.</p>\n<p>Additionally, an August 4 <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/04/iphone-17-air-battery-half-thickness-17-pro/\"><em>MacRumors </em>report</a> says the internal battery pack of the iPhone Air is just 2.49mm thick — half the thickness of the iPhone 17 Pro battery. The leak was posted on the <a href=\"https://m.blog.naver.com/PostView.naver?blogId=yeux1122&amp;logNo=223958615195&amp;navType=by\">Korean-language Naver blog</a>, where they show the alleged batteries of the iPhone 17 Air and 17 Pro side by side. The same account claimed the 17 Air's battery capacity was a mere 2,800 mAh, <em>MacRumors</em> notes. (That's below the battery capacity of current iPhone 16 models.)</p>\n<p>A recent rumor from Majin Bu, whom <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/11/iphone-17-pro-antenna-rumor/\"><em>MacRumors </em></a>classifies as a &quot;hit-or-miss leaker,&quot; suggests the iPhone 17 Pro will have better wireless signal strength thanks to an updated antenna design. The individual <a href=\"https://x.com/MajinBuOfficial/status/1954890746693312762\">posted a render on X</a> that shows a new antenna system that wraps around the iPhone 17 Pro's supposedly wider rear camera bump. Again, this is a render, not a real-world photo. That said, we can't knock the goal of better wireless reception, so we're hoping this one has a degree of truth to it.</p>\n<p>Each new roster includes a base model, but over the years, Apple has shaken up the variety of phones it offers. Most likely there will be an iPhone 17 and an iPhone 17 Pro. Apple has also committed to the size matters philosophy, and has been building an iPhone Pro Max option with an even bigger screen and better battery life; the 17 roster will almost certainly have one as well.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The new Pro iPhones are said to have a full-width &quot;camera island&quot; on the rear, which would mark the first time an Apple model opted for that design. This feature can be seen in the <a href=\"https://x.com/Skyfops/status/1949936265232888057\">purported iPhone 17 &quot;spotted in the wild.&quot;</a> The pics, highlighted on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/28/iphone-17-pro-possibly-spotted-in-the-wild/\"><em>MacRumors</em></a>, show a black cased iPhone (17 Pro?) with the distinct back panel. Is it the real deal? The dual angles lend a degree of credibility in a social media landscape increasingly polluted with AI-enhanced fakes, but your guess is as good as ours.</p>\n<div id=\"a462ba8164d54c5a8ac8626b1540fe2f\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">I just spotted a test development iPhone in the wild 🤩🤩🤩 <a href=\"https://t.co/iS3PtKWqxJ\">pic.twitter.com/iS3PtKWqxJ</a></p>— Fox Pupy 🦊🧡 (@Skyfops) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Skyfops/status/1949936265232888057?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 28, 2025</a></blockquote>\n \n\n</div>\n<p>The iPhone 17 Air seems primed to take the place of a potential iPhone 17 Plus. Since the iPhone 16e was only just introduced in February at <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/a-599-iphone-16e-is-a-cruel-joke-200507275.html\">a surprisingly high price point</a>, it seems unlikely that there will be a new addition to that lower end of the spectrum, the models that were previously called SE.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>At the very least, it sounds like the iPhone 17 Air won't take away the charging port and rely only on wireless connectivity. <em>Bloomberg</em> said that while Apple had investigated making the iPhone 17 Air without a single port, the company (fortunately) changed plans. He also says that the rumored phone will have a 6.6-inch screen and include the Dynamic Island and Camera Control button. Finally, the price is rumored at $900 — likely more than the standard iPhone 17 but less than the Pro.</p>\n<p>We've also gotten what seems to be a reliable look at what the color lineup will be for the new smartphones. <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2849423/iphone-17-colors-confirmed-see-all-of-apples-2026-options-right-here.html\"><em>Macworld</em></a> reported that the iPhone 17 will be available in black, white, steel gray, green, purple and light blue. The iPhone 17 Air will reportedly have four color options: black, white, light blue and light gold. While the Air colors will be less saturated, the visuals for the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max will go bold. The options for the Pro models are expected to be black, white, gray, dark blue and orange.</p>\n<p>On July 30, <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/phones/iphones/iphone-17-dummies-just-leaked-in-all-colors-and-theres-a-bold-new-signature-hue\"><em>Tom's Guide</em></a> highlighted an X post from <a href=\"https://x.com/SonnyDickson/status/1950325609957380405\">Sonny Dickson</a> — a longtime and generally reliable leaker of unreleased iPhone information — showing &quot;dummy&quot; iPhone 17 models in the new colors that were the source of the aforementioned <em>Macworld</em> story. While these are literally just mock-ups — not real, leaked iPhones — it's interesting to see how the design and color rumors translate into a real-world look and feel.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-what-will-the-new-ios-be-like\">What will iOS 26 be like?</h2>\n<p>Apple upended its numbering conventions with WWDC 2025, and will match the name of each new operating system to the year it's released. So when the next wave of iPhones hits, they'll be running on <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/apple-ios-26-public-beta-is-live-heres-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-new-iphone-features-and-how-to-use-them-135749325.html\">iOS 26</a>.</p>\n<p>On the design side, the smartphone OS introduced during the big developer showcase took a contentious approach dubbed Liquid Glass. Apple has been <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/apple-read-your-mean-tweets-about-liquid-glass-and-finder-222230726.html\">scaling down</a> the amount of transparency effects in the subsequent beta tests of iOS 26, but it will still have a glass-like visual.</p>\n<p>The feature list includes big and small updates. On the more impactful side, the Phone and Photos apps have been redesigned. There will be several features leveraging artificial intelligence, such as live translation capabilities coming to Phone, FaceTime and Messages. Apple is also currently testing a sensitive content warning for child accounts that will <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/ios-26-can-freeze-your-facetime-video-if-it-detects-nudity-135329941.html\">freeze FaceTime video</a> if nudity is detected by on-device machine learning tools. And the company is also launching Visual Intelligence, which will use AI to search for elements in an image.</p>\n<p>iOS 26 also has a litany of minor, quality of life improvements. Group texts are getting support for polls. And for the slow risers out there, iOS 26 will finally let you escape the tyranny of the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apple-will-at-long-last-let-you-customize-snooze-times-on-alarms-in-ios-26-190001600.html\">nine minute snooze alarm</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The next iOS is now available as a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/how-to-install-the-ios-18-public-beta-202938588.html\">public beta</a>. Here are our initial impressions of the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/ios-26-beta-preview-liquid-glass-is-better-than-you-think-172155402.html\">Liquid Glass design</a> and other new features. <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/apple-released-ios-26-public-beta-heres-the-list-of-compatible-iphones-that-can-download-it-today-191854620.html\">iOS 26 is compatible</a> with all models back through iPhone 11.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-what-other-products-are-expected-to-be-released-alongside-the-iphone-17\">What other products are expected to be released alongside the iPhone 17?</h2>\n<p>If Apple follows its usual pattern, the iPhone 17 will be announced alongside new Apple Watch products. That would be the Apple Watch Series 11 (if Apple sticks to the same naming scheme), and maybe an Apple Watch Ultra 3 and/or an updated Apple Watch SE. (They'll all run <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/wearables/watchos-26-preview-its-the-little-things-140035949.html\">watchOS 26</a>, of course.)</p>\n<p>Other possibilities — and this is, again, speculation — could include refreshed Apple AirPods Pro (which received its <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/airpods-pro-review-second-generation-130048218-130048292.html\">last big update in 2022</a>) and maybe new <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/wearables/apples-next-airtag-is-coming-in-2025-with-privacy-improvements-173028439.html\">AirTags trackers</a> (first released in 2021).</p>\n<p>But knowing Apple doesn't like to take the spotlight off its star performer — the iPhone — those accessories could come sometime later in the year (if they appear this year at all). The same goes for rumored refreshes of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/13/new-apple-tv-coming-later-this-year-with-a17-pro-chip/\">Apple TV</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/13/homepod-mini-new-chip/\">HomePod mini</a>, which are also getting long in the tooth.</p>\n<p>Don't expect any Macs or iPads, however. Apple has recently been holding computer updates for late October (as it did last year with the new <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/everything-apple-announced-during-its-unofficial-mac-week-210115997.html\">M4 Macs</a>).</p>\n<p><strong>Update, August, 13, 2025, 10:02PM ET:</strong> Added a list of the products that are expected to be released alongside the iPhone 17s.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Update, August 11, 2025, 7:27PM ET:</strong> Added a render of a rumored new antenna design for the iPhone 17 Pro.</p>\n<p><strong>Update, August 8, 2025, 4:43PM ET:</strong> Added new speculation and reports about iPhone 17 pricing.</p>\n<p><strong>Update, August 6, 2025, 4:05PM ET:</strong> Added latest details about the potential iPhone 17 event date.</p>\n<p><strong>Update, August 4, 2025, 5:23PM ET:</strong> Added latest battery leaks about the iPhone 17 models.</p>\n<p><strong>Update, August 1, 2025, 8:15AM ET:</strong> Added new photos showing potential iPhone 17 colors.</p>\n<p><strong>Update, July 30, 2025, 11:08AM ET:</strong> Added latest leaks and rumors about the iPhone 17, and updated information on the iOS 26 public beta.</p>\n<p><strong>Update, July 17, 2025, 4:40PM ET:</strong> Added latest information about iOS 26, possible materials for the Air, and the color options for the different models.</p>\n<p><strong>Update, March 17, 2025, 2PM ET:</strong> Added details about the rumored price and features of the iPhone 17 Air.</p>\n<p><strong>Update, April 11, 2025, 3:45PM ET: </strong>Added details from Front Page Tech's new video that claims to reveal details from a leaked iOS 19 build.</p>\n<p><em>Katie Teague contributed to this story.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-17-release-is-rumored-for-september-everything-you-need-to-know-ahead-of-the-apple-fall-event-153024317.html?src=rss"}

You'll also notice buttons with a new floating design. Liquid Glass was designed to make all of Apple's OSes more cohesive.</p>\n<p><strong>Phone app redesign:</strong> You'll finally be able to scroll through contacts, recent calls and voicemail messages all on one screen. It also comes with a new feature called Hold Assist that'll notify you when an agent comes to the phone so you can avoid the elevator music.</p>\n<p><strong>Live Translate:</strong> iOS 26 is bringing the ability to have a conversation via phone call or text message with someone who speaks another language. Live Translate will translate your conversation in real time.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Polls feature:</strong> Coming to group messages in the Messages app, chat members will be able to create polls. This can help prevent the unwanted 30+ messages when it comes to deciding which restaurant you're meeting at this weekend.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/ready-for-apples-ios-26-these-are-all-the-compatible-iphones-that-can-run-public-beta-2-right-now-191854071.html?src=rss"}

Sources reportedly told the publication that Apple has a slate of new smart home products in the works that could help pivot its lagging AI strategy.</p>\n<p>The center of the new lineup is a tabletop AI companion that has been described as an iPad on a movable robotic arm. It would be able to swivel to face the screen toward a user as they move around their home or office. Sources said the current prototype uses a horizontal display that's about seven inches while the motorized arm can move the screen about six inches away from the base in any direction. Equipped with a <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/an-updated-siri-that-interacts-with-apps-reportedly-wont-be-here-until-next-spring-183000378.html\"><ins>long-promised overhaul</ins></a> to the Siri voice assistant, this device could act like an additional person, recalling information, making suggestions and participating in conversations. According to <em>Bloomberg</em>, Apple is targeting a 2027 release for this product.&nbsp;</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Apple's new lineup is also rumored to include a smart home hub that is a simpler version of the robotic friend with no moving stand. We might be seeing this sooner, with a projected 2026 release for the device. This hub device would be able to control music playback, take notes, browse the web and host videoconferencing. Both the robot companion and the smart home hub are reportedly running a new operating system called Charismatic that's designed to support multiple users. The Siri running on the device will be given a particularly cheery personality, and it may also be getting a visual representation. <em>Bloomberg</em>'s sources said there hasn't been a final decision on aesthetics; internal tests have had Siri looking like an animated Finder icon and like a Memoji.</p>\n<p>Today's scuttlebutt follows on previous reports from Gurman that pointed to Apple's interest in these categories. The idea of a smart home hub was apparently floated at the company as far back as 2022, and it's finally being <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/apples-smart-home-hub-could-reportedly-make-its-debut-later-this-year-161702487.html\"><ins>rumored</ins></a> to have a formal debut some time this year.

While this <em>Bloomberg</em> piece offers more detail about those hypothetical plans, there's always a chance Apple will change direction or scrap a project.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/apples-tabletop-robot-companion-rumored-for-2027-launch-204904807.html?src=rss"}

Chibi-Robo’s helpfulness isn’t limited to humans, though. In its quest to spread happiness, it also assists several animals and even enchanted toys along the way. As a player, you have to keep an eye on the robot’s battery life and use power outlets dotted around the house to recharge it. Fail to do so and it’ll collapse, and you’ll lose a chunk of the in-game currency you’ve collected.</p>\n<p><em>Chibi-Robo! </em>looks like a typically charming Nintendo game in every respect, but it was actually originally conceived by now-defunct developer Skip Ltd. as a point-and-click adventure game, with Bandai as the publisher. Exactly how or why the game ended up moving over to Nintendo remains a mystery, but director Kenichi Nishi told <a href=\"https://www.timeextension.com/features/the-making-of-chibi-robo-how-miyamoto-saved-a-cult-hit-from-the-scrapheap\"><em>Time Extension</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>that<em>&nbsp;</em>Shigeru Miyamoto took a particular liking to the character design. The legendary Mario creator then went on to play something of an overseer role in the game’s development under its new publisher.</p>\n<p><em>Chibi-Robo! </em>spawned a number of handheld spinoffs, but the original game remains the one with cult classic status. It’s also become increasingly hard to play over the years, with Nintendo choosing not to port the game forward.

There's no reason to go with Norton as your VPN unless you're getting it as part of another Norton 360 bundle.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">For this review, I ran rigorous tests that highlighted Norton VPN's strengths (well-designed user interfaces, a verified privacy policy) along with its weaknesses (holes in its security, renewals that double the price, weak customer support). Norton's history of focusing on Windows means that app is by far the most complete; if you're on any other platform, expect to miss out on the best VPN protocols and the complete feature set.</p> \n<p><em>Editors' note: We're in the process of rebooting all of our VPN reviews from scratch.

Its apps for Windows, Mac, Android, iOS and browsers are all similar, but there are distinctions in both design and features.</p> \n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"jump-link-windows\" style=\"margin-top: 16pt; margin-bottom: 4pt;\">Windows</h3> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">Once you download the Norton VPN app from its website or the Microsoft Store, an installation wizard takes over and makes the rest of the process easy. You'll have to click to grant a few permissions and skip through a tutorial, but after that, you're free to move about the interface.</p> \n<figure> \n <img alt=\"windows app norton vpn\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-08/91d66b31-748b-11f0-9e7f-c069cac1ac32\" style=\"height: 3000px; width: 4000px;\" /> \n <figcaption></figcaption> \n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n </div> \n</figure> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">Norton VPN's Windows UI was a pleasant surprise. There's no wasted detail on the front page. Click the large yellow button to connect to the VPN, or select the server name to go to the location list, which is alphabetized. Clicking the very first entry in the list connects you to the fastest location. IP rotator servers and double VPN routes are grouped under tabs below that. There's no clutter and no aggressive popups, and connections happen quickly.</p> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">You'll find four tabs on the left-hand side of the Window. The top one manages the VPN. Then there's a store for other Norton products (IMO the only real misstep), a set of help pages and the controls for the VPN's settings and features. This last is subdivided into a row of easily understandable subtabs. I'm impressed by how seamlessly the design works in explanations of what each setting does — it makes the whole thing that much more accessible.</p> \n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"jump-link-mac\" style=\"margin-top: 16pt; margin-bottom: 4pt;\">Mac</h3> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">Downloading Norton VPN for Mac is a quick and painless process, with one slight difference from Windows: you'll have to mess around a bit in System Preferences to give Norton the permissions it needs. Fortunately, the setup wizard guides you through the steps with text and animations.</p> \n<figure> \n <img alt=\"mac app norton vpn\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-08/91f16d40-748b-11f0-be3f-ce92971cfe97\" style=\"height: 3000px; width: 4000px;\" /> \n <figcaption></figcaption> \n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n </div> \n</figure> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">The actual interface is just as free of clutter as the Windows app — more so in some cases, as there's no shilling of the rest of the Norton family. The downside is that there's also no help center access from the main window; you have to go to Settings -&gt; Troubleshooting to find the link. There also aren't links to specific help articles like the Windows app includes.</p> \n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"jump-link-android\" style=\"margin-top: 16pt; margin-bottom: 4pt;\">Android</h3> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">One word of warning about Norton VPN's mobile apps: you need an internet connection for the initial login and setup. It doesn't appear to be opening a website, but if you don't have web access, you'll get stuck in an endless loading loop.</p> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">The front pages of Norton VPN's desktop apps don't have many design elements, so the same general schematic is easy to compress onto mobile. The Android client has a status indicator, a large button to start your connection, tabs along the bottom and a gear icon for settings in the top-right. It's all intuitive and responsive.</p> \n<figure> \n <img alt=\"android app norton vpn\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-08/91f16d41-748b-11f0-bfda-2c3032eedba3\" style=\"height: 2340px; width: 1080px;\" /> \n <figcaption></figcaption> \n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n </div> \n</figure> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">If I were to change anything, though, I'd take some of the options from the upper-right settings menu and swap them with the bottom tabs for notifications and accounts settings. VPN preferences should be accessible in one click, especially protocols. Frankly, the messages you get from this app aren't important enough to merit such pride of place.</p> \n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"jump-link-ios\" style=\"margin-top: 16pt; margin-bottom: 4pt;\">iOS</h3> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">Norton VPN's apps for iPhone and iPad are almost identical to its Android app. The only real difference is that the iOS client is missing some features, most notably split tunneling; also, the kill switch is only available on the Mimic protocol, about which there's limited information. Other than that, it feels good to use. While it's not great that Apple users lose out on the full feature set, I can't deny it alleviates the problem of the VPN preferences menu feeling overstuffed.</p> \n<figure> \n <img alt=\"ios app norton vpn\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-08/91f14630-748b-11f0-9eed-b254e6e8fcb7\" style=\"height: 1334px; width: 750px;\" /> \n <figcaption></figcaption> \n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n </div> \n</figure> \n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"jump-link-browser-extensions\" style=\"margin-top: 16pt; margin-bottom: 4pt;\">Browser extensions</h3> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">Norton VPN has browser extensions for Chrome, Firefox and Edge. The only reason to install any of these is to access the ad blocker, which doesn't come with either of the desktop apps. Other than that, it's an underwhelming extension. I recommend skipping it and going with a dedicated ad blocker instead — you'll get more customization features that way.</p> \n<figure> \n <img alt=\"chrome extension norton vpn\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-08/91d66b30-748b-11f0-afef-63aa18aeb9ab\" style=\"height: 1112px; width: 843px;\" /> \n <figcaption></figcaption> \n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n </div> \n</figure> \n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"jump-link-norton-vpn-speed-test\" style=\"margin-top: 18pt; margin-bottom: 6pt;\">Norton VPN speed test</h2> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">Using speedtest.net, I tested Norton VPN to see how much it slowed down my browsing speeds. I then calculated the results as percentages. While different networks give you different starting speeds, the same server location tends to slow down all those networks at about the same rate. You can use this table to estimate how much speed you can expect while Norton VPN is running.</p> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">As a reference, you generally need download speed for loading web pages and videos, upload speed for sending large amounts of data and latency for real-time communication. Latency always increases sharply over longer distances, but a good VPN can still keep the jumps under control. Let's see how Norton VPN did.</p> \n<table> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <td><p><strong>Server location</strong></p> </td> \n   <td><p><strong>Latency (ms)</strong></p> </td> \n   <td><p><strong>Increase factor</strong></p> </td> \n   <td><p><strong>Download speed (Mbps)</strong></p> </td> \n   <td><p><strong>Percentage drop</strong></p> </td> \n   <td><p><strong>Upload speed (Mbps)</strong></p> </td> \n   <td><p><strong>Percentage drop</strong></p> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><p>Portland, OR, USA (unprotected)</p> </td> \n   <td><p>18</p> </td> \n   <td><p>—</p> </td> \n   <td><p>58.90</p> </td> \n   <td><p>—</p> </td> \n   <td><p>5.91</p> </td> \n   <td><p>—</p> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><p>Portland, OR, USA (protected)</p> </td> \n   <td><p>30</p> </td> \n   <td><p>1.7x</p> </td> \n   <td><p>55.83</p> </td> \n   <td><p>5.2</p> </td> \n   <td><p>5.53</p> </td> \n   <td><p>6.4</p> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><p>McAllen, TX, USA</p> </td> \n   <td><p>164</p> </td> \n   <td><p>9.1x</p> </td> \n   <td><p>48.96</p> </td> \n   <td><p>16.9</p> </td> \n   <td><p>5.70</p> </td> \n   <td><p>3.6</p> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><p>Argentina</p> </td> \n   <td><p>422</p> </td> \n   <td><p>23.4x</p> </td> \n   <td><p>43.02</p> </td> \n   <td><p>27.0</p> </td> \n   <td><p>5.72</p> </td> \n   <td><p>3.2</p> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><p>Croatia</p> </td> \n   <td><p>379</p> </td> \n   <td><p>21.1x</p> </td> \n   <td><p>46.35</p> </td> \n   <td><p>21.3</p> </td> \n   <td><p>5.65</p> </td> \n   <td><p>4.4</p> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><p>Nigeria</p> </td> \n   <td><p>564</p> </td> \n   <td><p>31.3x</p> </td> \n   <td><p>39.94</p> </td> \n   <td><p>32.2</p> </td> \n   <td><p>3.86</p> </td> \n   <td><p>34.7</p> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><p>Indonesia</p> </td> \n   <td><p>375</p> </td> \n   <td><p>20.8x</p> </td> \n   <td><p>44.88</p> </td> \n   <td><p>23.8</p> </td> \n   <td><p>5.64</p> </td> \n   <td><p>4.6</p> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><p><strong>Average</strong></p> </td> \n   <td><p><strong>322</strong></p> </td> \n   <td><p><strong>17.9x</strong></p> </td> \n   <td><p><strong>46.50</strong></p> </td> \n   <td><p><strong>21.1</strong></p> </td> \n   <td><p><strong>5.35</strong></p> </td> \n   <td><p><strong>9.5</strong></p> </td> \n  </tr> \n </tbody> \n</table> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">Before I interpret the results, I should mention that the algorithm Norton VPN uses to pick the fastest server doesn't seem to be reliable. Every time I clicked it, it gave me the server in Texas, thousands of miles from my real location in Portland, Oregon. Moreover, the Portland server was obviously faster. This happened repeatedly over multiple days of testing.</p> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">To the point: this table doesn't look good for Norton VPN. Download speeds dropped an average of 21.1 percent, the worst showing of any VPN I've tested so far. What's worse, the data clearly trend toward worse speeds at greater distances. Although it's true that distance impacts download speed as well as latency, it's also true that a well-implemented modern server OS should be able to render that effect minimal.</p> \n<figure> \n <img alt=\"speed test norton vpn\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-08/91e27921-748b-11f0-8b67-d4fd7b70bbb8\" style=\"height: 1344px; width: 3032px;\" /> \n <figcaption></figcaption> \n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n </div> \n</figure> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">Upload speed looks better, with an average drop of under 10 percent — mainly dragged down by the Nigeria server, which cut speeds sharply across every test. Latency is also not awful. Controlling for the expected variance due to distance, Norton VPN beat out both Surfshark and NordVPN in average worldwide ping, which suggests that gaming may be its comfort zone.</p> \n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"jump-link-norton-vpn-security-test\" style=\"margin-top: 18pt; margin-bottom: 6pt;\">Norton VPN security test</h2> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">A VPN's primary job is to change your IP address. While doing this, it must also encrypt your communications with its servers so nobody can follow your connection home — this is what separates a VPN from a simple proxy. In this section, I'll run three checks to see whether Norton VPN can guarantee anonymous browsing.</p> \n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"jump-link-vpn-protocols\" style=\"margin-top: 16pt; margin-bottom: 4pt;\">VPN protocols</h3> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">VPNs use protocols to establish stable connections between your devices and their servers. Most providers pick from the same pool of field-tested options, but you do see a surprise every now and then, like Norton VPN's Mimic.</p> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">Norton VPN's protocol selection follows its general trend of serving very different experiences to users on different platforms. Windows and Android users get WireGuard, OpenVPN and Mimic, while macOS and iOS users only get Mimic and IKEv2. Here's a rundown of each.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><strong>WireGuard </strong>is the most modern open-source VPN protocol currently available. It's almost always the fastest and uses a secure stream cipher for cryptography. The one downside is that it saves your real IP address to keep the connection open. Norton VPN deals with this by assigning temporary dynamic IP addresses during the authentication process.</p></li> \n <li dir=\"ltr\" style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre;\"><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><strong>OpenVPN </strong>is an open source protocol that's been in use for ages. Its source code is slightly clunky after years of volunteers poking it for weaknesses, but that also makes it the most trustworthy option. It's fast on average, though usually slower than WireGuard or IKEv2.</p></li> \n <li dir=\"ltr\" style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre;\"><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><strong>IKEv2 </strong>is a fast protocol that's good at reconnecting mobile devices as they move between networks. Norton VPN uses it in conjunction with IPSec encryption. If you're on an Apple device, it's your only option other than Mimic.</p></li> \n <li><p><strong>Mimic </strong>is an obfuscation protocol, which makes your VPN connection look like regular HTTPS traffic. This can get around networks that block all VPN traffic regardless of content. Mimic is based on TLS 1.3, and uses the same standard encryption algorithms as the other protocols.</p></li> \n</ul> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">Normally, I advise letting your VPN choose what protocol is best. Norton VPN is different. There simply isn't enough information about Mimic for me to trust it, and you shouldn't let the VPN switch you to it without your knowledge. All the others are fine, though.</p> \n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"jump-link-leak-test\" style=\"margin-top: 16pt; margin-bottom: 4pt;\">Leak test</h3> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">Testing a VPN for leaks is easy: just check your IP address before and after connecting, and see if it changes. I used IPleak.net to run that test on several Norton VPN servers. I first observed that Norton VPN prevents IPv6 leaks by blocking IPv6 altogether. On every run, the IPv6 test failed to load, no matter which server location I chose. This is an effective way to make leaks impossible, since almost none of the internet is IPv6-only yet.</p> \n<figure> \n <img alt=\"ipv6 blocked norton vpn\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-08/91e27920-748b-11f0-bedf-852a8f72e847\" style=\"height: 1353px; width: 3246px;\" /> \n <figcaption></figcaption> \n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n </div> \n</figure> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">My second conclusion was that Norton VPN's servers don't leak through DNS or WebRTC while your connection remains stable. However, every time I changed from one location to another, my real IP address was visible on the test screen for several seconds. Enabling the kill switch solved this problem, but the kill switch is not active by default, so make sure you turn it on in the settings.</p> \n<figure> \n <img alt=\"dns leak norton vpn\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-08/91e167b0-748b-11f0-9fbb-2bb34c6d9ad9\" style=\"height: 1380px; width: 2777px;\" /> \n <figcaption></figcaption> \n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n </div> \n</figure> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">There is one other serious problem with this: on the iOS app, the kill switch cannot be used except with the Mimic protocol. This forces users to choose between leaving a hole in their security or trusting it to a protocol with limited transparency. Until this changes, I can't recommend installing Norton VPN on iOS at all.</p> \n<p>I tested the rotating IP server in the United States to see if it had the same problem, and thankfully didn't notice it. A Norton representative also confirmed that all servers have their own DNS resolvers that avoid public servers, cutting off a big source of leaks. Still, I'd recommend keeping the kill switch engaged. As long as you remember this, Norton VPN is secure.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-encryption-test\">Encryption test</h3> \n<p>Finally, I ran a test with WireShark to see if Norton VPN's protocols managed to encrypt my traffic. Since I've been uncertain about Mimic, I used it for the encryption test. I found that Mimic does in fact encrypt data packets, even on an unsecured HTTP connection. WireShark also confirmed to me that Mimic is using TLS for key exchange and encryption.</p> \n<figure> \n <img alt=\"encryption test norton vpn\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-08/91e2a030-748b-11f0-9e7f-e4ce2d807698\" style=\"height: 1164px; width: 3329px;\" /> \n <figcaption></figcaption> \n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n </div> \n</figure> \n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"jump-link-how-much-does-norton-vpn-cost\" style=\"margin-top: 18pt; margin-bottom: 6pt;\">How much does Norton VPN cost?</h2> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">Norton VPN subscriptions are only available for one year at a time — there's no monthly option. There are three different subscription tiers, summarized in the table below. \"Number of devices\" refers to how many devices you can have installed on a single account, whether or not any of them are connected to the VPN.</p> \n<table> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <td><p><strong>Subscription</strong></p> </td> \n   <td><p><strong>Starting price (One year)</strong></p> </td> \n   <td><p><strong>Renewal price (One year)</strong></p> </td> \n   <td><p><strong>Number of devices</strong></p> </td> \n   <td><p><strong>Features</strong></p> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><p>Standard</p> </td> \n   <td><p>$39.99</p> </td> \n   <td><p>$79.99</p> </td> \n   <td><p>5</p> </td> \n   <td><p>Basic VPN service, IP rotation, double VPN, kill switch</p> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><p>Plus</p> </td> \n   <td><p>$49.99</p> </td> \n   <td><p>$109.99</p> </td> \n   <td><p>5</p> </td> \n   <td><p>Antivirus, password manager, dark web alerts, 10GB cloud backup</p> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><p>Ultimate</p> </td> \n   <td><p>$59.99</p> </td> \n   <td><p>$129.99</p> </td> \n   <td><p>10</p> </td> \n   <td><p>Parental controls, device locator</p> </td> \n  </tr> \n </tbody> \n</table> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">The Standard subscription is a reasonable price for what you get, but the superior Proton VPN is barely more expensive and Surfshark is actually cheaper. In other words, Norton VPN is a good price, but not great value — especially when you factor in the renewal prices, all of which force you to pay double or more what you paid the first time. If you'd like to decide for yourself, all the plans do come with a 60-day money-back guarantee.</p> \n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"jump-link-norton-vpn-side-apps-and-bundles\" style=\"margin-top: 18pt; margin-bottom: 6pt;\">Norton VPN side apps and bundles</h2> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">Norton is better known as an antivirus company than a VPN provider, so naturally Norton VPN is packaged with the rest of the Norton 360 family. Be warned — unless you turn the option off in the Settings -&gt; Privacy tab, Norton will collect information on your app usage and use it to target you with ads for its other products.</p> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">Norton 360 is a massive product line encompassing dozens of individual subscriptions. To keep this section from bloating, I'll focus on the software available as part of an upgraded Norton VPN subscription, then end by listing the Norton 360 plans that include Norton VPN.</p> \n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"jump-link-features-on-norton-vpn-plus\" style=\"margin-top: 16pt; margin-bottom: 4pt;\">Features on Norton VPN Plus</h3> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">A Norton VPN Plus subscription adds several features from Norton's antivirus suite, but isn't a complete replacement for Norton or any other dedicated antivirus software. Plus users get most of the antivirus features that work in real time, including a smart firewall, anti-ransomware backups, a sandbox for quarantining suspicious programs and a malicious script blocker.</p> \n<p>VPN subscribers do not get access to the quicker Smart Scan option, instead getting a different scan feature that checks for online threats (note that the <a href=\"https://support.norton.com/sp/en/us/home/current/solutions/v20240726114723559\">FAQ page</a> about this erroneously says Norton VPN includes Smart Scan). VPN users also miss out on the LiveUpdate feature that installs security patches autonomously, plus the automated hard drive cleaner.</p> \n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"jump-link-features-on-norton-vpn-ultimate\" style=\"margin-top: 16pt; margin-bottom: 4pt;\">Features on Norton VPN Ultimate</h3> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">In addition to raising the device limit to 10, Norton VPN Ultimate adds two features on top of Plus: parental controls and Privacy Monitor. The latter is only available in the US and Canada.</p> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">Parental control is both a time-based site blocker and a monitoring app. It can not only track a child's internet activity, but also their physical location, giving you alerts if they leave set boundaries during a certain time (say school property during a weekday). Privacy Monitor scans for your information on data brokerage sites so you can send deletion requests, similar to Surfshark Incogni.</p> \n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"jump-link-norton-360-plans-that-include-norton-vpn\" style=\"margin-top: 16pt; margin-bottom: 4pt;\">Norton 360 plans that include Norton VPN</h3> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">Instead of subscribing to Norton VPN directly, you can also pick a Norton 360 plan that includes VPN service. Norton 360 Standard and Norton 360 For Gamers each let you install Norton VPN on three devices. Norton 360 Deluxe raises that number to five, while Norton 360 with Lifelock Select and Norton 360 with Lifelock Advantage grant you 10 total VPN installs. Norton 360 with Lifelock Ultimate Plus lets you install Norton VPN on an unlimited number of devices.</p> \n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"jump-link-close-reading-norton-vpns-privacy-policy\" style=\"margin-top: 18pt; margin-bottom: 6pt;\">Close-reading Norton VPN's privacy policy</h2> \n<p>To assess Norton VPN's privacy, we need to look at two different privacy policies. Like I said in the introduction, there are technically two products called Norton VPN — the standalone service I've been reviewing and the VPN features of the Norton 360 bundle. I've been focused on the independent Norton VPN so far, but since the Norton 360 VPN add-on is a privacy risk, I want to mention it here.</p> \n<p>Norton lists the privacy policies for each of its products <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=02faf16c-8eea-4114-a20e-7db1c0f119c0&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=9a9a32a1-c506-4077-9db1-d8922d34d6e3&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Norton&amp;linkText=on+one+page&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3VzLm5vcnRvbi5jb20vcHJpdmFjeS9wcm9kdWN0cy1wcml2YWN5LW5vdGljZSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiOWE5YTMyYTEtYzUwNi00MDc3LTlkYjEtZDg5MjJkMzRkNmUzIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3VzLm5vcnRvbi5jb20vcHJpdmFjeS9wcm9kdWN0cy1wcml2YWN5LW5vdGljZSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAdfybE3QXdIAEk4MrKsD0ivrDzcCR8tdiV_Nh_kvQ_dW&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fus.norton.com%2Fprivacy%2Fproducts-privacy-notice\">on one page</a> of its website. The VPN feature of Norton 360 is governed by the top two policies, Norton Security Products (desktop) and Norton 360 Mobile Apps. The standalone Norton VPN has its own policy further down the page.</p> \n<p>The Norton 360 policy is a privacy nightmare. Both the desktop and mobile apps claim the right to save your IP address, device fingerprints and web activity for up to 36 months, and there's no exception for the VPN feature. I strongly advise against using Norton 360's bundled VPN for any activity you don't want Norton seeing.</p> \n<p>Fortunately, Norton holds the standalone VPN to a much more acceptable set of rules. It isn't permitted to collect IP addresses, browsing history or DNS requests, nor can it share any of the data it does collect with partners. The partners note is important because one of Norton's sibling companies, Avast, is known to have <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-27-avast-jumpshot-selling-user-data.html\">sold information on its users</a> to corporations for ad targeting. A Norton representative stated that Avast is no longer involved in harvesting or selling user data. More importantly, he said that no data from VPN products is shared between Gen Digital brands.</p> \n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"jump-link-independent-privacy-audits\" style=\"margin-top: 16pt; margin-bottom: 4pt;\">Independent privacy audits</h3> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">A recent audit by penetration testing firm VerSprite provides reason to be hopeful about Norton VPN's privacy. According to a report published in August 2024, <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=02faf16c-8eea-4114-a20e-7db1c0f119c0&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=9a9a32a1-c506-4077-9db1-d8922d34d6e3&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Norton&amp;linkText=which+you+can+download+from+this+page&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3VzLm5vcnRvbi5jb20vZmVhdHVyZS9ub3J0b24tdnBuLW5vLWxvZy1wb2xpY3kiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjlhOWEzMmExLWM1MDYtNDA3Ny05ZGIxLWQ4OTIyZDM0ZDZlMyIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly91cy5ub3J0b24uY29tL2ZlYXR1cmUvbm9ydG9uLXZwbi1uby1sb2ctcG9saWN5In0&amp;signature=AQAAAaB644obAjaQlco0Y5Uk1GrFOEoY3MPUSlTv0cYp-I2U&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fus.norton.com%2Ffeature%2Fnorton-vpn-no-log-policy\">which you can download from this page</a>, VerSprite found that Norton VPN posed an overall \"low\" privacy risk, judged on a scale of low, medium, high and critical risks.</p> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">During their audit, VerSprite informed Norton that certain conditions could make VPN users identifiable. In a second round of tests, Norton appears to have fixed those vulnerabilities. That's certainly reassuring, but I wish the report — which only runs three pages in all — was more specific about what the problem actually was. Regardless, the VerSprite audit is a good sign that Norton VPN is taking privacy more seriously than Norton as a whole.</p> \n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"jump-link-can-norton-vpn-change-your-virtual-location\" style=\"margin-top: 18pt; margin-bottom: 6pt;\">Can Norton VPN change your virtual location?</h2> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">If a VPN can change your virtual location, it can not only throw ISPs and other interlopers off your real identity, but also change what you see on the internet — especially on streaming sites, where connecting through a different country can unlock new shows. However, Netflix and its brethren block VPN traffic for copyright reasons, so it's never a guarantee that you'll get in.</p> \n<figure> \n <img alt=\"netflix canada norton vpn\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-08/91f14631-748b-11f0-bff7-08439abfd41b\" style=\"height: 1213px; width: 3165px;\" /> \n <figcaption></figcaption> \n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n </div> \n</figure> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">I tested Norton VPN's ability to unblock Netflix on five different locations, connecting three times on three different servers in each place. I set the app to automatically choose the protocol. In the table below, you'll see how many tests each location passed, and whether Netflix showed new content each time. If I get into Netflix but the library doesn't change, that indicates the server might be leaky.</p> \n<table> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <td><p><strong>Server location</strong></p> </td> \n   <td><p><strong>Unblocked Netflix?</strong></p> </td> \n   <td><p><strong>Changed content?</strong></p> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><p>Vancouver, Canada</p> </td> \n   <td><p>3/3</p> </td> \n   <td><p>3/3</p> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><p>Iceland</p> </td> \n   <td><p>0/3</p> </td> \n   <td><p>0/3</p> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><p>Latvia</p> </td> \n   <td><p>3/3</p> </td> \n   <td><p>3/3</p> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><p>Morocco</p> </td> \n   <td><p>3/3</p> </td> \n   <td><p>3/3</p> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><p>Philippines</p> </td> \n   <td><p>3/3</p> </td> \n   <td><p>3/3</p> </td> \n  </tr> \n </tbody> \n</table> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">I had no problems in four out of five of the locations I tested, but Netflix utterly defeated the Iceland servers. No matter how many times I disconnected and reconnected to get a new IP address, Netflix recognized a VPN server and blocked me. This happened even when I switched to the Mimic protocol.</p> \n<figure> \n <img alt=\"iceland blocked norton vpn\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-08/91f16d42-748b-11f0-ba77-52e36d4c5e8b\" style=\"height: 1782px; width: 3282px;\" /> \n <figcaption></figcaption> \n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n </div> \n</figure> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">That indicates that Netflix has blocklisted most or all of Norton VPN's servers in Iceland, and the company hasn't caught up. It's another troubling indication that Norton isn't committing the level of attention that its server network requires.</p> \n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"jump-link-investigating-norton-vpns-server-network\" style=\"margin-top: 18pt; margin-bottom: 6pt;\">Investigating Norton VPN's server network</h2> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">Speaking of the server network, now's the time to get deeper into it. The relative scarcity of different IP addresses on Norton VPN, along with the download speed drops over long distances, suggest to me that Norton might have relegated maintaining VPN data centers to an afterthought. So, let's see what its worldwide server selection looks like.</p> \n<table> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <td><p><strong>Region</strong></p> </td> \n   <td><p><strong>Countries with servers</strong></p> </td> \n   <td><p><strong>Total server locations</strong></p> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><p>North America</p> </td> \n   <td><p>5</p> </td> \n   <td><p>32</p> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><p>South America</p> </td> \n   <td><p>6</p> </td> \n   <td><p>6</p> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><p>Europe</p> </td> \n   <td><p>36</p> </td> \n   <td><p>47</p> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><p>Africa</p> </td> \n   <td><p>5</p> </td> \n   <td><p>5</p> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><p>Middle East</p> </td> \n   <td><p>2</p> </td> \n   <td><p>2</p> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><p>Asia</p> </td> \n   <td><p>10</p> </td> \n   <td><p>10</p> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><p>Oceania</p> </td> \n   <td><p>2</p> </td> \n   <td><p>4</p> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><p>Total</p> </td> \n   <td><p>66</p> </td> \n   <td><p>106</p> </td> \n  </tr> \n </tbody> \n</table> \n<p>All of Norton VPN's server locations are physical, with no virtual locations. This makes its network more reliable — virtual server locations can deliver unexpected speed swings. However, it does limit the number of locations Norton is capable of offering.</p> \n<p>The selection is reasonably good, with many locations in often-underserved Africa and South America, and many options in marquee regions like the US and Europe. However, it's a pretty small network for what Norton is charging. Also, as we saw with the Iceland location getting blocked by Netflix, having a country on the menu doesn't necessarily mean it will do the job.</p> \n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"jump-link-extra-features-of-norton-vpn\" style=\"margin-top: 18pt; margin-bottom: 6pt;\">Extra features of Norton VPN</h2> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">Norton VPN added a ton of features in the first several months of 2025. Most of these mainly brought it up to par with other VPNs, like city-level region selection or support for smart TVs. However, there are one or two you won't find in many other places, like the IP rotator — to my knowledge, nobody else has that except Surfshark. Here are the most important extras to know about.</p> \n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"jump-link-ad-blocker\" style=\"margin-top: 16pt; margin-bottom: 4pt;\">Ad blocker</h3> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">Norton VPN's ad blocker can be used on its browser extension. Its mobile apps can block the trackers embedded in ads, but not the ads themselves. There's not a lot of customization potential; you can turn it on and off, and that's mainly it. The one option you have on the extension is to turn \"acceptable ads\" back on. This can help you get into sites that normally block users with adblock on, or use sites where you want to see ads to help them monetize.</p> \n<figure> \n <img alt=\"Ad tracker blocker norton vpn\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-08/91d35df0-748b-11f0-bff3-145cf60d58cb\" style=\"height: 2340px; width: 1080px;\" /> \n <figcaption></figcaption> \n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n </div> \n</figure> \n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"jump-link-double-vpn-and-ip-rotator\" style=\"margin-top: 16pt; margin-bottom: 4pt;\">Double VPN and IP rotator</h3> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">Norton introduced these two features in 2025 as \"enhanced anonymity\" upgrades. Double VPN runs your VPN through two server locations instead of one, so you're still safe if one server breaks down. You can choose from eight pre-determined multi-hop paths with endpoints in the USA, the UK, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Japan, Germany and Taiwan.</p> \n<figure> \n <img alt=\"double hop norton vpn\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-08/91e25210-748b-11f0-adbf-6a2dd84b8100\" style=\"height: 1345px; width: 2006px;\" /> \n <figcaption></figcaption> \n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n </div> \n</figure> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">IP rotation servers change your IP address frequently while you're connected, which makes you harder to track. Unlike Surfshark, which lets you turn this on everywhere, Norton VPN limits you to six IP rotator locations: the USA, the UK, Canada, Japan, Germany and Australia.</p> \n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"jump-link-convenience-features\" style=\"margin-top: 16pt; margin-bottom: 4pt;\">Convenience features</h3> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">The next three features were also added in the last eight months. The server location menu now puts your last five locations at the top for easy retrieval. While connected to a server, you can pause the VPN for 15, 30 or 60 minutes, after which it turns back on. Finally, the mobile apps have added a home screen widget so you can operate the VPN without opening the app.</p> \n<figure> \n <img alt=\"pause connection norton vpn\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-08/91d75590-748b-11f0-b37f-77b98e25959e\" style=\"height: 1344px; width: 2014px;\" /> \n <figcaption></figcaption> \n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n </div> \n</figure> \n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"jump-link-kill-switch\" style=\"margin-top: 16pt; margin-bottom: 4pt;\">Kill switch</h3> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">A VPN kill switch cuts off your internet access if you lose your VPN connection, so any sensitive information isn't broadcast unprotected. Norton VPN's kill switch is vital, since it appears to briefly drop encryption while switching server locations. Unfortunately, it's not available on iOS.</p> \n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"jump-link-split-tunneling\" style=\"margin-top: 16pt; margin-bottom: 4pt;\">Split tunneling</h3> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">The Windows and Android apps for Norton VPN allow split tunneling, in which only certain apps go through the VPN while others connect directly. Norton uses app-based split tunneling, but if you want to protect or remove protection from specific URLs, you can use two different web browsers.</p> \n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"jump-link-wi-fi-security\" style=\"margin-top: 16pt; margin-bottom: 4pt;\">Wi-Fi security</h3> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">This feature, which appears on NortonVPN's mobile apps only, activates whenever you connect to a Wi-Fi network. Norton VPN scans that network for common attacks launched over Wi-Fi, like DNS poisoning and SSL stripping, and sends you an alert if it detects any.</p> \n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"jump-link-p2p-optimization\" style=\"margin-top: 16pt; margin-bottom: 4pt;\">P2P optimization</h3> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">Norton VPN has certain servers in its network configured for torrenting. You can't use it for torrenting outside those locations — if you try, the VPN will disconnect. To connect to a P2P server, just select \"P2P-optimized region\" from the server menu. You can't choose a torrenting server in a specific region; the app just selects the fastest.</p> \n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"jump-link-norton-vpn-customer-support-options\" style=\"margin-top: 18pt; margin-bottom: 6pt;\">Norton VPN customer support options</h2> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">Following the broad trend of Norton VPN, the Windows app gets most of the love, having much more in-app support than any other platform. Mac users get a troubleshooting tab in the settings menu, with three options: go to the online help center, send a bug report or go to the community forum. iOS and Android just have a \"help and support\" button on the accounts page that sends you straight to the website.</p> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">On Windows, there's a separate help and support tab above the settings tab, which gives you direct links to some of the most important pages on the Norton website. It's also got links to the forum and help center. Then there's the same troubleshooting tab as the Mac app, but with more options. Windows users can reset the app to default, record a problem to get more specific help, send debug logs and run an automated \"Repair Norton\" process.</p> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">If you got to the website through a desktop app, it's surprisingly difficult to get to the general support page for Norton VPN — Windows links to a splintered set of FAQ pages, while Mac sends you to a Mac-specific page for the entire Norton Family. I recommend just going to support.norton.com in your browser, then clicking the Norton VPN button. At least the links in both mobile apps take you straight there.</p> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">Once you have gotten to the Norton VPN support page, you won't find much of use. Help articles are limited and leave some big holes. For example, all connectivity problems are limited to a page called \"Fix problem accessing the internet when connected to Norton VPN.\" The only advice for Windows, Mac and Android is to choose a different VPN protocol, and there's nothing at all for iOS.</p> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">Even worse, whenever you use the search bar to look anything up, you're forced to watch an AI answer type itself out in real time, so links to the actual help pages are constantly jumping around as you try to click on them. It's this feature that pushes Norton's help pages from negligent to hostile.</p> \n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"jump-link-live-support-experience\" style=\"margin-top: 16pt; margin-bottom: 4pt;\">Live support experience</h3> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">There are a few other ways to get support from Norton VPN. You can check in on the community forum, chat live with an agent or call their phone line. The forums are reasonably active for Windows, but pretty dead for all other platforms.</p> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">I used live chat to ask about a problem with installing the iOS app. I managed to reach a human pretty quickly, but there were several long pauses during our conversation. Eventually, they escalated my case to a higher support team.</p> \n<figure> \n <img alt=\"live chat norton vpn\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-08/91d66b30-748b-11f0-bdff-1b3d4d888c6f\" style=\"height: 1753px; width: 2963px;\" /> \n <figcaption></figcaption> \n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n </div> \n</figure> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">I assumed that this team would send me an email, per standard practice. Instead, they repeatedly tried to reach me by phone. I was not warned that they would do this, and each time, the call was flagged as spam. By the time I realized Norton was calling me, I'd already solved the problem myself. Be aware of this if you plan to contact Norton with a difficult issue.</p> \n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"jump-link-norton-vpn-background-check\" style=\"margin-top: 18pt; margin-bottom: 6pt;\">Norton VPN background check</h2> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">The Norton software brand has existed in some form or another since the Norton Utilities package was developed for DOS in 1982. The brand was acquired in 1990 by Symantec, which had published its own first antivirus program the year before. Symantec began releasing Norton Antivirus in 1991, and continued distributing it until its merger with Avast in 2022. Since then, the combined company has been called Gen Digital.</p> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">Compared to that long history, Norton VPN has only been around for a blip. It <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/norton-adds-a-vpn-and-more-to-its-refreshed-360-products\">launched in 2019</a> as part of Symantec's bid to expand the Norton Antivirus line into a suite that could defend against more types of threats. As such, while Norton and Symantec have been involved in their share of controversies over the years, very few of them happened during Norton VPN's lifetime.</p> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">Despite Norton's long and checkered history, checking the background of its VPN is pretty simple: nothing has gone seriously wrong yet. This VPN has problems, but they're mainly out in the open, stemming from it being a relative afterthought from a company more focused on other types of security.</p> \n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"jump-link-final-verdict\" style=\"margin-top: 18pt; margin-bottom: 6pt;\">Final verdict</h2> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">For me to recommend a VPN, it has to stand out in a crowded field. After a week of working with Norton VPN, I have to conclude that the only way it distinguishes itself is the Norton name. For everything else it does, a competitor does it better. Surfshark scoops it on IP rotation and multihop, ExpressVPN has better protocols, NordVPN is faster and Proton VPN's ad blocker works in more places.</p> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">One thing I will say in Norton VPN's favor is that it's working to rectify all this. In the last year, it's added a lot of features. The problem is that most of those are options I'd have expected it to have already, such as city-level region selection and a kill switch on Mac. It's catching up, not innovating.</p> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">It's also nice that you can use the bundles to roll more Norton products into one subscription. However, since Norton is much more experienced at developing other sorts of security software, I'd advise going the Norton 360 route if you're interested in those other features and treating the VPN as an add-on. Norton VPN is a side dish, not an entree.</p> \n<p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/norton-vpn-review-a-vpn-that-fails-to-meet-nortons-standards-170037086.html?src=rss"}

That helped it cast a wide net (and probably make more money), but it also came with technical limitations.

Both the PS5 Pro and Xbox Series X will reach 2160p at 60fps. However, the two high-end systems will support Dynamic 4K resolution. Meanwhile, the Xbox Series S will run at 1080p at 60fps or 1440p at 30fps.

The basic gameplay remains, with players being asked to feed, groom and play with small digital creatures inside a handheld device. But new features have also been added, like Bluetooth connectivity and downloadable content (they're also <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/heres-the-absolutely-massive-tamagotchi-paradise-next-to-other-objects-in-the-wild-for-scale-172017149.html\">a little bigger</a> than before). This month, however, Hasbro is throwing its hat into the ring with the Nano-Mals, a $20 device that takes the standard features of a virtual pet and aims them toward a new purpose: fidget toy.</p> \n<p>The first thing you’ll probably notice when you pick up one of the eight initial Nano-Mals models is how cute they all are: they’re styled after both common and uncommon animals, including two cows, two cats, a red panda, a narwhal, and a pair of unicorns.But the second thing you’ll notice is that there’s no screen to be found anywhere; instead, the sole “display” is a a light-up heart on the front of the toy that has three levels and changes color to indicate how satiated the toy is in terms of hunger, affection and play.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span> \n<p>How you fulfill these needs is where the Nano-mals distinguish themselves from other virtual pets: Instead of pushing buttons and navigating through various menus, you interact instead with the various parts of the toy directly. Push down on its ear to “pet” it, flip its arms to “dance” and push its nose to “feed” it. The more you perform these actions, the more each color of the heart will fill up, eventually resulting in a rainbow kaleidoscope across the toy’s chest.</p> \n<p>It’s incredibly easy to do, not just because these are simple actions, but because they’re engineered to be satisfying since it is a fidget toy. It feels good to flip the arms up and down and squish the ears. Not so much for pushing the shallow nose button though, meaning it was often the need that took the longest for me to fulfill. It just wasn’t fun to push the nose! I can only hope that future iterations improve on this.</p> \n<p>Once you’ve figured out the basic functions, it becomes a game in itself to figure out the best way to hold and interact with the device. You don’t need to look at it and the entire thing can be operated with one hand, which is exactly what you want in a fidget toy. I found myself rotating it between my fingers while flipping the arms – the device also contains an accelerometer so any significant movement also counts as “play.”</p> \n<p>If you have more than one Nano-mal – which is quite likely given the device’s low price – the toys will interact with each other, lighting up and talking to each other. It’s cute but also a bit unsettling, as it was very reminiscent of this year’s Black Mirror episode “Playthings” with the Nano-mals emitting mysterious bleats and chimes just like the Thronglets. Fortunately, there is an off switch, and the Nano-mals will burble happily before shutting down when you use it.</p> \n<figure> \n <img alt=\"Hands-on photo of Hasboro's Nano-Mals fidget toys.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-08/29b27680-784a-11f0-bfc7-47b0ec963810\" style=\"height: 2268px; width: 4032px;\" /> \n <figcaption></figcaption> \n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n   Kris Naudus for Engadget \n </div> \n</figure> \n<p>However, the off switch isn’t absolute as, should you press any of the buttons, the Nano-mal will still react, though maybe not effusively as if the device were powered fully on. This is a problem given that the Nano-mal is meant to be taken out and about (there’s even a clip at the top), but will likely be banned from classrooms due to the possibility of it being accidentally triggered when a kid moves their stuff. The toys can be muted by holding down the nose for a few seconds, but it only works when the device is fully powered on, and resets every time the Nano-mal is turned off and on.</p> \n<p>Aside from that and the fact that I couldn’t remove the attachment clip, which got in the way when I was trying to spin the device in my hand, I think the Nano-mal is a solid first try at this kind of toy. Kids will love how cute they are, especially when you dress them up in the included clothes, which double as protective cases for the devices. And adults will appreciate them too: Parents are big on screen-free devices, while the young-at-heart will appreciate having something to keep their hands busy that isn’t their phone.</p> \n<p>The Nano-mals are available now at all major toy retailers, including <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=3719d8d4-5edd-4817-998a-91f3229e7323&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=f1960b1f-5003-451b-abd3-205b4b90cdf5&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Walmart&amp;linkText=Walmart&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy53YWxtYXJ0LmNvbS9zaG9wL25hbm9tYWxzIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJmMTk2MGIxZi01MDAzLTQ1MWItYWJkMy0yMDViNGI5MGNkZjUiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndhbG1hcnQuY29tL3Nob3AvbmFub21hbHMifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAVH8Mwa3CRYpfPmbdo30AsYW5pKVj07MBQqmCK3EpUoL&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fshop%2Fnanomals\">Walmart</a> and <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B0DNG7729S&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=f1960b1f-5003-451b-abd3-205b4b90cdf5&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=Amazon&amp;custData=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&amp;signature=AQAAAcVQme3mNZu3WN4xReUtYJwZ06M1Eor51TJsxdIRjk-2&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FNANO-MALS-Stardream-Electronic-Responses-Interactive%2Fdp%2FB0DNG7729S\">Amazon</a>.</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/hasbros-nano-mals-are-a-virtual-pet-that-rewards-fidgeting-141553387.html?src=rss"}

So instead of watchOS 12, I’ve spent the past two weeks with the public beta of watchOS 26. The naming scheme shift is subtle, but helpful — which is how I’d describe the upgrades the new software brings to the Apple Watch. The AI-powered Workout Buddy better contextualizes your Fitness data and an added gesture gives the watch a fun trick that’s actually helpful. Other upgrades — including better smart replies and the Liquid Glass treatment — all combine to make the watch work and look a bit better than it did before. It’s not a game-changing shift, like <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/ios-26-public-beta-is-available-to-download-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-new-iphone-and-ipad-update-135749331.html\">other OS 26 releases</a>, but it manages to make a great watch a touch better.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-luminous-liquid-glass\">Luminous Liquid Glass</h2>\n<p>Every Apple operating system got the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/ios-26-beta-preview-liquid-glass-is-better-than-you-think-172155402.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAAEufKxgWteWNCu3R9pldJLME6Ik2e013731N1jiT3NntZJaG_DoowjYuTcFJADyOVagbkTD2n414zlqmwDrHUBEe7rWdtkotScjOaree7X0ti2EPpyS7W5tCyXVuC-ssLrpsXn2HlciPxCLjeIdZBCr5zYYH3aI8uj_PvkOJXEi\">Liquid Glass treatment</a> this year, including watchOS 26. The change is less noticeable on the Apple Watch than on the iPhone or iPad, though. You’ll notice the semi-transparent buttons and flowy movement when entering your password and opening the control center — the icons look like they’re surrounded in little drops of water, which is quite pretty. You’ll see it on the Photos watch face, too, especially if you select the “glass” color for the time readout.&nbsp;</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><figure><img alt=\"The time numerals get the Liquid Glass treatment with the Photos watch face. \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-08/b788fde0-76d7-11f0-bdff-222bc9dc0f43\" style=\"height: 1441px; width: 2560px;\" /><figcaption>The Liquid Glass treatment for the Photos watch face.&nbsp;</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Amy Skorheim for Engadget</div></figure>\n<p>The Smart Stack now has a liminal glow and the app icons are likewise a touch more luminous than before. The effect is subtle and nicely unifies the look of the watch and its companion iPhone. Like all design upgrades, Liquid Glass made me feel like I was using a new watch — though, like everything, the novelty wore off after a week or two.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-revamped-workout-app-combines-ai-stats-with-a-dj\">Revamped Workout app combines AI stats with a DJ</h2>\n<p>In addition to the Buddy, the Workout app has a new look with icons in each of the four corners of the screen that give you easier access to adjust your data view, play music, set goals and tweak Buddy settings. My favorite new feature is in the music menu and it’s limited to Apple Music for now. If you tap the music icon, you have the option to auto-play music. From there, you can also select “Picked for you” or “Choose media.” The former will select music that matches the type of workout you’re doing and what you like to listen to. As someone who gets derailed from pretty much all my tasks when I have to interact with my phone, I appreciate anything that can make decisions for me and prevent me from reaching for it.</p>\n<p>I was presented with peppy beats that matched the cadence of my run, from bands and artists that were familiar as well as new-to-me selections that fit my tastes. Unfortunately, it didn’t always work correctly. Sometimes I’d get no music, other times the music would play but the Workout Buddy would fall silent. I realize I’m testing a public beta of watchOS 26, so I’m holding out hope the feature will work at launch. Because when it worked, it was glorious.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"A person holds an apple watch 10 displaying the new workout app\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-08/a7ba9680-77b3-11f0-acfb-bc5c489c2f1a\" style=\"height: 1440px; width: 2560px;\" /><figcaption>The new Workout app layout.&nbsp;</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Amy Skorheim for Engadget</div></figure>\n<p>The new Workout Buddy is probably the biggest AI play in watchOS 26. It uses historical and real-time data collected by your watch to give you a window into how you’re performing at the beginning, end and throughout a workout. It works for walking, running, cycling and other workouts but requires headphones and a nearby Apple Intelligence-<a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-intelligence-what-devices-and-features-will-actually-be-supported-185850732.html\">compatible</a> iPhone. That gave me pause. I hate carrying stuff and/or sticking things in my ears when I run. But after acquiring some open earbuds and digging out my old <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B0D3HWPZ85&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=012d64a0-674e-4646-8e36-d4ee0d9de2a5&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=Spibelt&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2RwL0IwRDNIV1BaODU_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMDEyZDY0YTAtNjc0ZS00NjQ2LThlMzYtZDRlZTBkOWRlMmE1Iiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2RwL0IwRDNIV1BaODUiLCJkeW5hbWljQ2VudHJhbFRyYWNraW5nSWQiOnRydWUsInNpdGVJZCI6InVzLWVuZ2FkZ2V0IiwicGFnZUlkIjoiMXAtYXV0b2xpbmsiLCJmZWF0dXJlSWQiOiJ0ZXh0LWxpbmsifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAUU3NfOtvYuctRlpN9eW700wJ1FbPL4M09KujCOg7Roj&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0D3HWPZ85\">Spibelt</a>, I made it work.</p>\n<p>There are three voices to choose from as of this writing, a bright feminine option, a British male-sounding one and another female-presenting version with a lower register. These were built on vocal data from Fitness+ trainers and have an authentic sound to them. At the start of a workout, you’ll get a brief pep talk along with some recent milestones. My pre-game walking and running talks included references to the day of the week, my location and accumulated fitness data. For example, “Way to get out there on a Wednesday morning walk in Albuquerque. So far this week, you’ve done three walking workouts. Let’s get in some steps!”</p>\n<p>Depending on the type of exercise, you can set target ranges for cadence, heart rate, speed, distance, power (cycling), time and others. During a workout, the AI will let you know if you’re at, below or above those levels. The first time I tried Workout Buddy, my run was quite lonely. I didn’t realize I had to turn on the Buddy, as well as the various goal metrics within the Workout app. I did that and, on my next run, the AI delivered cadence and heart rate updates, and let me know when I hit milestones like distance and duration.</p>\n<p>At the end of a workout, you’ll see a thinking animation as the AI assembles a summary. It’ll recap data like your pace, distance, average and peak heart rate, as well as progress on your Activity rings. It’ll also point out comparisons or cumulative milestones you may have hit. For example, after a longer walk, it told me that I’d just burned the most calories on a walk so far. Another day, it told me I’d walked ten miles so far this week. It closes the update by encouraging you to take the energy into the rest of your day or something similarly positive but measured.</p>\n<p>That’s a big improvement over the first few times I used the feature. My first few pep talks were cloying, telling me something along the lines of “It’s not easy to get out there early in the morning!” and “Your effort is inspiring!&quot; After I stopped a run early to fuss with settings, it told me I did a “Great job!” on a three-minute run. Thankfully, Apple appears to be tweaking the Buddy behind the scenes, calibrating the AI’s “personality.” Recent pep talks have become noticeably less sycophantic and therefore more enjoyable. I imagine the Buddy will only continue to evolve even more from here.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-the-workout-buddy-is-not-a-coach\">The Workout Buddy is not a coach</h2>\n<p>The Workout Buddy is a motivational experience that provides personalized insights you can use to gauge your performance. But I just finished trying out <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-8-review-samsungs-best-smartwatch-in-years-155857108.html#:~:text=browsing%20your%20tiles.-,The%20running%20coach,-made%20me%20mad\">Samsung’s AI running coach</a> on the Galaxy Watch and couldn’t help comparing the two. That coach pushed me to run five kilometers for the first time in my life. The Buddy made me feel like I’d accomplished something special just by taking my dog on a stroll. Both have their place, but I’d say Apple’s version is probably best for those who already know what their goals are and what they need to do to hit them. Samsung’s version may be better for beginners who want some help shaping their fitness journey.</p>\n<p>In addition to the Buddy, the Workout app has a new look with icons in each of the four corners of the screen that give you easier access to adjust your data view, play music, set goals and tweak Buddy settings. My favorite new feature is in the music menu and it’s limited to Apple Music for now. If you tap the music icon, you have the option to auto-play music. From there, you can also select “Picked for you” or “Choose media.” The former will select music that matches the type of workout you’re doing and what you like to listen to. As someone who gets derailed from pretty much all my tasks when I have to interact with my phone, I appreciate anything that can make decisions for me and prevent me from reaching for it.</p>\n<p>I was presented with peppy beats that matched the cadence of my run, from bands and artists that were familiar as well as new-to-me selections that fit my tastes. Unfortunately, it didn’t always work correctly. Sometimes I’d get no music, other times the music would play but the Workout Buddy would fall silent. I realize I’m testing a public beta of watchOS 26, so I’m holding out hope the feature will work at launch. Because when it worked, it was glorious.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-more-hands-free-fun-with-wrist-flick\">More hands-free fun with wrist flick</h2>\n<p>I love the double tap gesture Apple <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-is-now-live-with-double-tap--heres-how-to-customize-the-gesture-on-watchos-101-133021753.html\">introduced</a> with the Apple Watch Series 9 — it’s a pleasure to stop timers, start auto-detected workouts and answer calls without getting my other hand involved. But it took some practice before I could reliably get the watch to recognize the gesture. (The trick is raising your wrist in an exaggerated checking-the-time motion then quickly, but not too quickly, tapping your thumb and finger together twice.)</p>\n<p>Luckily, the new Wrist Flick motion introduced in watchOS 26 takes practically no effort to get right. It involves quickly turning the back of your wrist away from you and back up again. Doing that can silence a call, stop a ringing timer, dismiss notifications and return you to the watch face from any app you open. It also makes those <del>irritating</del> helpful “Time to stand!” reminders go away. The wrist flick doesn’t clear alerts, just dismisses them — so the red indicator dot disappears, but the notification remains and you can see it if you swipe down. Just note that it’s only available to Apple Watch Series 9, 10 and the Ultra 2.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"A demonstration of clearing notifications with the wrist flick gesture\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-08/11f22670-77ba-11f0-b6f9-6996b2529ca4\" style=\"height: 320px; width: 640px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Amy Skorheim for Engadget</div></figure>\n<p>Wrist flick is a great feature — though it's important to note that Android wearables since WearOS 2 had a similar feature for a while now. And I’d like to see Apple adopt more hands-free interactions like this. Apple already has many gesture-based controls as part of its existing <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/guide/watch/assistivetouch-apdec70bfd2d/watchos\">AssistiveTouch</a> feature. Actions like fist clenches, wrist tilts and single or double taps can control most of the navigation on the watch. Unfortunately, turning on AssistiveTouch turns off the universal double tap feature. I’d be interested in seeing something that splits the difference. Perhaps four or five gestures for basic functions that can be used in conjunction with screen input.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-smarter-replies-could-make-messages-a-usable-watch-app\">Smarter replies could make Messages a usable watch app</h2>\n<p>The Apple Watch is great for reading texts, but replying is awkward. That tiny keyboard is an interface for ants — even talk-to-text input is inefficient as it’s tough to correct mistakes. Smart Replies are little canned responses that appear as suggestions below the reply field. Those aren’t new, but now Series 9 watches and later will use an improved on-device language model to come up with relevant bits of text you can send with a tap.</p>\n<p>In addition to the choices that are always offered — Okay, Yes, No, Thank you and Can I call you later? — I saw things like “Ok, let me know” and “That’s so sweet!” both of which applied to their respective conversations. I wasn’t always given Smart Reply suggestions, and some of them weren’t very relevant, but again, it’s a great feature that will save time when it works.</p>\n<p>Another Messages update is a carryover from iOS 26 (and borrowed from countless other messaging apps). You can now set custom backgrounds for each of your (Apple-only) contacts. Just note that whatever you set will be seen by all participants in the conversation, once they update to iOS 26. On your watch, the photo, gradient or pattern you pick carries over to your conversations. Not only does it look nice, I find backgrounds help me to not accidentally text my mom something I meant to send to my sister.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"You can apply different backgrounds to your conversations in Messages\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-08/b78924f0-76d7-11f0-97a3-d2837d663e80\" style=\"height: 1440px; width: 2560px;\" /><figcaption>Backgrounds are now available in Messages.&nbsp;</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Amy Skorheim for Engadget</div></figure>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-notes-have-arrived\">Notes have arrived</h2>\n<p>The Notes app is now on Apple Watch. I honestly hadn’t noticed the lack before this — I know there are plenty of <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apps/the-only-thing-i-want-from-apples-big-2025-redesign-is-a-120023531.html\">Notes enthusiasts</a> out there, but in my world, Alexa handles all reminder and shopping list duties. Still, I can see how the new integration could come in handy. After creating a simple shopping checklist in the iOS Notes app, I opened the list on my watch while I was shopping and found it far easier to check things off on my wrist than dragging out my phone every time I stuck something in my cart.</p>\n<p>I’m curious to see whether Apple’s improved prediction algorithms for the new OS will eventually add Notes to my Smart Stack suggestions after I open the Notes app a few times at the grocery store. As it stands now, the Notes widget will pop up first in the Smart Stack if that’s the last app you used.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-the-rest-of-the-new-stuff\">The rest of the new stuff</h2>\n<h3 id=\"jump-link-face-gallery\"><strong>Face Gallery</strong></h3>\n<p>The iPhone Watch app has a new look and now organizes watch faces by category instead of by name. Groupings include New, Clean, Data-rich, Photos and Health and Fitness, among others. It’s certainly an improvement, but one that makes you wonder why it wasn’t always like this.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"The Watch Face gallery is categorized now.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-08/b78924f0-76d7-11f0-bfbd-132a621428bd\" style=\"height: 1441px; width: 2560px;\" /><figcaption>The Watch Face gallery is categorized now.</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Amy Skorheim for Engadget</div></figure>\n<h3 id=\"jump-link-adaptive-sound\"><strong>Adaptive sound</strong></h3>\n<p>Another nice-but-obvious update adjusts the volume of pings and beeps to fit the environment — quieter in a noiseless office and louder at a raucous BBQ. I set a timer to go off when I was quietly working at my desk and then again with loud music playing and I couldn’t really tell the difference. But that’s a hard metric for the humble human ear to judge. Again, this is a feature reserved for Series 9 models and later.</p>\n<h3 id=\"jump-link-smart-stack\"><strong>Smart Stack</strong></h3>\n<p>The Smart Stack will now add a small prompt to your watch face when it detects certain situations. For example, if you open the camera app on your phone, a small camera icon appears at the bottom of your watch screen, as a suggestion to open the remote shutter. Apple gives other examples, such as showing the workout icon when you arrive at your usual pilates studio or the <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/guide/watch/use-backtrack-to-retrace-your-steps-apd25bfcec3f/watchos\">Backtrack</a> navigation feature when you journey away from cellular connectivity.</p>\n<p>I didn’t see the prompt very often, but I did notice that the Smart Stack rearranged itself according to my habits — such as putting the medication widget at the top of the stack right around the time it was time to take my prescription, or shuffling Shazam to the top when it hears music playing.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-siri-is-still-siri\">Siri is still Siri</h2>\n<p>Coming fresh off of reviewing the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8, I can’t help but notice a stark difference between that wearable’s fully integrated, AI-powered Gemini and Apple’s same-old Siri. Gemini on the Samsung watch helped me find new stuff in my city, performed convoluted tasks and answered some pretty esoteric questions. I use Siri on my watch to reliably set timers, text people and add events to my calendar. But it’s not quite on the level of Gemini’s contextually-aware, generative capabilities that can interact with multiple apps. Asking something like “Where should I have lunch?” gave me a list of businesses with lunch in the name followed by Siri asking me: “Which one?” Not sure what that meant. Gemini, on the other hand, gave me local and relevant ideas for places I’d actually want to eat.</p>\n<p>Even before AI swallowed everyone’s mind, I had a soft spot for digital assistants. When Alexa sings the “You’re very, very, oh so very welcome” song, I get a dopey smile on my face. I’ve tried to love Siri, but I get frustrated by being misunderstood, misdirected, misheard and flat-out ignored. I know Apple doesn’t like to release new tech until it’s fully up to snuff, and I’m looking forward to seeing what finally happens with new Siri. But for now, the disparity shows.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-wrap-up\">Wrap-up</h2>\n<p>The changes watchOS 26 brings to the Apple Watch are perhaps not as grand as those for other Apple devices. Liquid Glass here isn’t as all-encompassing <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/ios-26-beta-preview-liquid-glass-is-better-than-you-think-172155402.html\">as it is on the iPhone</a>. The new watch features don’t make the wearable finally realize its full potential <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/ipados-26-preview-a-long-awaited-multi-tasking-update-pays-off-so-far-172522054.html\">like iPad OS 26</a> does for the tablet. And there isn’t one major feature upgrade that transforms the watch experience, like <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/macos-26-beta-preview-spotlights-time-to-shine-171700779.html\">macOS 26 does with Spotlight </a>on Macs.</p>\n<p>But the updates do push the experience of using the watch forward. Liquid Glass is pretty and nicely ties the wearable with its companion devices. The Workout app, which was already good at tracking fitness metrics, is even better with the Workout Buddy, providing stat summaries and automated playlists. Improved smart replies for Messages and the addition of the Notes app fix two of the watch’s previous shortcomings. And the wrist flick adds another option for hands-free interaction and — I hope — is a precursor to more such utility. I’m still holding out hope for an improved, personable and helpful Siri once Apple is ready, but for now, these are all welcome upgrades for what’s already the industry’s best overall smartwatch.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/watchos-26-preview-its-the-little-things-140035949.html?src=rss"}

It's a good deal for anyone who wants to take advantage of the Switch 2's camera functionality in games like <em>Mario Kart World</em> and that <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/chillin-by-the-fire-is-a-relaxing-co-op-campfire-sim-thats-out-today-on-nintendo-switch-2-150009762.html\">recently-released campfire sim</a>.</p> \n<p>This was designed specifically for Nintendo's new console, so it's a plug-and-play affair. It's actually cheaper than the official Switch 2 camera with this sale and it looks a whole lot cooler. It's a Piranha Plant from the Mario franchise. We called it a \"work of art\" <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/horis-piranha-plant-switch-2-camera-is-a-work-of-art-194430377.html\">upon encountering the device</a> and that holds true today.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span> \n<p> </p> \n<p>This thing is not only stylish, resembling an Amiibo more than a camera, but it's downright useful. The pot the Piranha Plant sits in functions as both a stand and USB extension for the device. The plant itself detaches from the pot, so the camera can be used in portable mode by popping it into the USB port at the top of the console.</p> \n<p>There's also a built-in privacy shutter. Just close the plant's mouth to obscure the lens. The actual camera specs here aren't going to win any awards, with a frame rate of 30FPS and a resolution of 640 x 480p. However, that's more than enough to capture footage of your floating head to accompany your kart as it races through the Mushroom Kingdom.</p> \n<p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals\"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on X for the latest </em><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/deals/\"><em>tech deals</em></a><em> and </em><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-tech/\"><em>buying advice</em></a><em>.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-hori-piranha-plant-camera-for-nintendo-switch-2-is-on-sale-for-33-percent-off-145031942.html?src=rss"}

After having hundreds of half-filled notebooks over the years, I, at some point, turned to digital tools instead because it was just easier to store everything on my phone or laptop so I always had my most important information at my fingertips.<br /><br />E-Ink tablets seem to provide the best of both worlds: the tactile satisfaction of regular notebooks with many of the conveniences found in digital tools, plus easy-on-the-eyes E-Ink screens. These devices have come a long way in recent years — now you can find them in multiple sizes, some have color E Ink screens and others double as full-blow ereaders with access to ebook stores and your local library’s offerings. I’ve tested out close to a dozen E Ink tablets over the past few years to see how well they work, how convenient they really are and which are the best tablets using E Ink screens available today.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-table-of-contents\">Table of contents</h2> \n<ul> \n <li><p><a href=\"#jump-link-best-e-ink-tablets-for-2025\">Best E Ink tablets for 2025</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"#jump-link-are-e-ink-tablets-worth-it\">Are E Ink tablets worth it?</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"#jump-link-what-to-look-for-in-an-e-ink-tablet\">What to look for in an E Ink tablet</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"#jump-link-other-e-ink-tablets-weve-tested\">Other E Ink tablets we've tested</a></p></li> \n</ul> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-best-e-ink-tablets-for-2025\">Best E Ink tablets for 2025</h2> \n<p> </p> \n<p> </p> \n<p> </p> \n<p> </p> \n<p> </p> \n<p> </p> \n<p> </p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-are-e-ink-tablets-worth-it\">Are E Ink tablets worth it?</h2> \n<p>An E Ink tablet will be a worthwhile purchase to a very select group of people. If you prefer the look and feel of an e paper display to LCD panels found on traditional tablets, it makes a lot of sense. They’re also good options for those who want a more paper-like writing experience (although you can get that kind of functionality on a regular tablet with the right screen protector) or a more distraction-free device overall.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span> \n<p>The final note is key here. Many E Ink tablets don’t run on the same operating systems as regular tablets, so you’re automatically going to be limited in what you can do. And even with those that do allow you to download traditional apps like Chrome, Instagram and Facebook, E Ink tablets are not designed to give you the best casual-browsing experience. This is mostly due to the nature of E Ink displays, which have noticeable refreshes, a lack of vibrant colors and lower picture quality than the panels you’ll find on even the cheapest iPad.</p> \n<p>Arguably the biggest reason why you <em>wouldn’t</em> want to go with an iPad (all models of which support stylus input, a plethora of reading apps, etc) is because it’s much easier to get distracted by email, social media and other Internet-related temptations.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-what-to-look-for-in-an-e-ink-tablet\">What to look for in an E Ink tablet</h2> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-writing-and-latency\">Writing and latency</h3> \n<p>Arguably the most important thing to consider when looking for an E Ink tablet is the writing experience. How good it is will depend a lot on the display’s refresh rate (does it refresh after every time you put pen to “paper,” or at a different regular interval) and the stylus’ latency. Most of the tablets I’ve tested have little to no latency, but some are certainly better than others. Finally, you should double check before buying that your preferred E Ink tablet comes with a stylus, or if you need to purchase one separately.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-reading\">Reading</h3> \n<p>How much will you be reading books, documents and other things on this tablet? E Ink tablets come in many sizes, but most of them tend to be larger than your standard e-reader because it makes writing much easier. Having a larger display isn’t a bad thing, but it might make holding it for long periods slightly more uncomfortable. (Most e-readers are roughly the size of a paperback book, giving you a similar feeling to analog reading).</p> \n<p>The supported file types for e-books can also make a big difference. It’s hard to make a blanket statement here because this varies so much among E Ink tablets. The TL;DR is that you’ll have a much better reading experience if you go with one made by a company that already has a history in e-book sales (i.e. Amazon or Kobo). All of the titles you bought via the<a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/amazons-kindle-scribe-updates-include-support-for-direct-on-page-writing-051753157.html\"> Kindle</a> or Kobo store should automatically be available to you on your Kindle or Kobo E Ink tablet.</p> \n<p>Also with Kindle titles, specifically, since they are protected by DRM, it’s not necessarily the best idea to try to<a href=\"https://www.ebook-converter.com/104-how-to-read-kindle-ebook-kobo.htm\"> bring those titles over to a third-party device</a>. Unless the tablet runs an operating system like Android that supports downloads for apps like Kindle and Kobo, you’ll be limited to supported file types, like ePUB, PDF, MOBI, JPEG, PNG and others.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-search-functionality\">Search functionality</h3> \n<p>Most E Ink tablets have some on-device search features, but they can vary widely between models. You’ll want to consider how important it is to you to be able to search through all your handwritten notes and markups. I noticed in my testing that Amazon’s and Kobo’s E Ink tablets made it easy to refer back to notes made in books and files because they automatically save to the specific pages on which you took notes, made highlights and more.</p> \n<p>Searching is less standardized on E Ink tablets that have different supported file types, but their features can be quite powerful in their own right. For example, a few devices I tested supported text search in handwritten notes along with handwriting recognition, the latter of which allows you to translate your scribbles into typed text.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-sharing-and-connectivity\">Sharing and connectivity</h3> \n<p>While we established that E Ink tablets can be great distraction-free devices, most manufacturers understand that your notes and doodles aren’t created in a vacuum. You may want to access them elsewhere, and that requires some form of connectivity. All of the E Ink tablets I tried have Wi-Fi support, and some support cloud syncing, companion mobile apps and the ability to export notes via email so you can access them elsewhere.</p> \n<p>None of them, however, integrate directly with a digital note taking system like Evernote or OneNote, so these devices will always be somewhat supplementary if you use apps like that, too. I’d argue that, if you already lean heavily on apps like OneNote, a standard tablet with a stylus and screen protector might be the best way to go. Ultimately, you should think about what you will want to do with the documents you’ll interact with on your E Ink tablet <em>after</em> the tablet portion is done.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-price\">Price</h3> \n<p>E Ink tablets aren’t known for being cheap. They generally fall into the $300-$800 price range, which is what you can expect to pay for a solid regular tablet, too. A key factor in price is size: cheaper devices with E Ink displays are likely to have smaller screens, and stylus support isn’t as much of a given. Also, those types of devices are generally considered e-readers because of their size and may not be the best for note-taking, doodling and the like.</p> \n<p>E Ink tablets have gone up in price recently. Supernote and Onyx Boox increased prices, as did reMarkable. The former said it was due to \"increased costs,” and a reMarkable representative confirmed this to Engadget and provided the following statement: \"We regularly review our pricing based on market conditions and operational costs. We've communicated an upcoming adjustment for the US market effective in May to provide transparency to our customers. Multiple factors influence our pricing decisions, including supply chain dynamics and overall operational costs in specific markets.”</p> \n<p>As a result, the reMarkable Paper Pro jumped from $579 to $629 (that's for the bundle with the standard Marker and no Folio). This isn't great, considering the Paper Pro was already on the expensive side of the spectrum for E Ink tablets. It's also worth noting that Supernote and Onyx Boox have raised prices in the past few months as well.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-other-e-ink-tablets-weve-tested\">Other E Ink tablets we've tested</h2> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-lenovo-smart-paper\">Lenovo Smart Paper</h3> \n<p>Lenovo made a solid E Ink tablet in the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/lenovo-smart-paper-review-a-solid-e-ink-tablet-spoiled-by-the-cost-133056534.html\">Smart Paper</a>, but it's too pricey and too married to the company's companion cloud service to warrant a spot on our top picks list. The hardware is great, but the software isn't as flexible as those of competitors like the reMarkable 2. It has good Google Drive integration, but you must pair it with Lenovo's cloud service to really get the most use out of it — and in the UK, the service costs £9 per month for three months, which is quite expensive.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-onyx-boox-tab-ultra\">Onyx Boox Tab Ultra</h3> \n<p>The <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=57f41413-eec2-4d90-9c25-26d144b737b8&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;linkText=Boox+Tab+Ultra&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3Nob3AuYm9veC5jb20vcHJvZHVjdHMvdGFiIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI1N2Y0MTQxMy1lZWMyLTRkOTAtOWMyNS0yNmQxNDRiNzM3YjgiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vc2hvcC5ib294LmNvbS9wcm9kdWN0cy90YWIifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAb7A7EPvy3G8_cwM2BUU4bg4uNsVGQKK3o2yEjUAdhc2&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fshop.boox.com%2Fproducts%2Ftab\">Boox Tab Ultra</a> has a lot of the same features we like in the Note Air 2 Plus, but it’s designed to be a true, all-purpose tablet with an E Ink screen. Running Android 11 and compatible with a magnetic keyboard case, you can use it like a standard 2-in-1 laptop, albeit a low-powered one. You can browse the web, check email and even watch YouTube videos on this thing — but that doesn’t mean you should. A standard 2-in-1 laptop with a more responsive screen and better overall performance would be a better fit for most people who even have the slightest desire to have an all-in-one device. Like the rest of Onyx’s devices, the Tab Ultra is specifically for those who put reading and eye comfort above all else.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/best-e-ink-tablet-130037939.html?src=rss"}

Some prioritize simplicity and sleek design, while others are packed with immersive features like Dolby Atmos and smart voice controls.

LG decided to carry over its most premium soundbars <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/lg-s95tr-and-sg10ty-first-look-two-takes-on-wireless-dolby-atmos-for-home-theater-154551736.html\">from 2024</a>, but it will add the compact <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/lg-previews-the-compact-s20a-soundbar-at-ces-2025-191337487.html\">S20A</a> this year. The company only previewed the model at CES, so full specs are still forthcoming.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span> \n<p>Samsung will once again keep the same overall design and features for its top-end Q990 soundbar. However, the company is adding a few new tools and it drastically reduced the size of the wireless subwoofer that comes in the box. Samsung does have one new model for 2025, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/samsung-debuts-the-qs700f-soundbar-and-updates-the-q990-at-ces-2025-030042257.html\">the QS700F</a>, that’s designed to sit on a table or automatically adjust to being mounted flat on a wall. Details are scarce on that soundbar for now and I anticipate a full spec sheet when the company is really to sell it.</p> \n<p>Of the big three TV companies, Sony is the only one that didn’t announce any home theater gear at CES. The company has decided to focus mainly on its automotive efforts at the show recently, leaving TV and audio announcements for later in the year. The company debuted <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/sony-debuts-bravia-theater-line-of-dolby-atmos-soundbars-and-speakers-160034176.html\">multiple soundbar options</a> in 2024 and a four-speaker setup for the living room in the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/sony-debuts-bravia-theater-line-of-dolby-atmos-soundbars-and-speakers-160034176.html\">Bravia Quad</a>. That said, it wouldn’t surprise me if Sony released new soundbars later in the year since its most recent models were only announced last April.</p> \n<p>One company I would keep an eye on is Sennheiser. The <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-23-sennheiser-ambeo-soundbar-review.html\">original Ambeo model</a> is nearly six years old and could use a refresh. The company has added <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/sennheiser-ambeo-soundbar-plus-sub-dolby-atmos-170353080.html\">medium</a> and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/sennheiser-ambeo-soundbar-mini-review-excellent-and-expensive-183045244.html\">mini</a> options to the Ambeo lineup since then, but it would be nice to see a refined version of the largest model too. The original Ambeo soundbar is huge, so no matter how good it sounds, it will always be a tough sell for some people.</p> \n<p>Although I think it’s less likely, it’s also possible that Sonos has new soundbars this year. While the company’s next device will likely be the rumored set-top streaming box, the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/what-is-sonos-sound-motion-technology-183313680.html\">Sound Motion tech</a> inside <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/sonos-arc-ultra-review-new-tech-powers-a-big-audio-upgrade-130011149.html\">the Arc Ultra</a> would offer a big improvement to bass performance in compact models like the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/sonos-beam-gen-2-review-dolby-atmos-soundbar-130024506.html\">Beam</a> and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/sonos-ray-soundbar-review-130050814-130050448.html\">Ray</a>. The company may bring Sound Motion to standalone speakers first, but it’s destined for those smaller soundbars <em>eventually</em>.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-the-best-soundbars-for-2025\">The best soundbars for 2025</h2> \n<p> </p> \n<p> </p> \n<p> </p> \n<p> </p> \n<p> </p> \n<p> </p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-\"></h2> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-what-to-look-for-in-a-soundbar\">What to look for in a soundbar</h2> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-features\">Features</h3> \n<p>When it comes to features, the more you pay the more you're going to get in your new audio system. Most affordable options ($150 or less) will improve your television's audio quality, but that's about it. Step into the $300 to $400 range and you'll find all-in-one soundbars with things like built-in voice control, wireless connectivity, Google Chromecast, AirPlay 2 and even Android TV. They're all helpful when you want to avoid looking for the remote control, but the best playback quality is usually only in the top tier and the formats those premium soundbar systems support. I’m talking about things like Dolby Atmos, DTS:X and other high-resolution audio standards — essentials if you’re building a truly cinematic home entertainment setup. And not all Atmos soundbars are equal, so you'll need to look at the finer details carefully before you break into the savings account. If you're looking for one of the best Dolby Atmos soundbars, size, channels and subwoofer options will be important factors to consider. Some models even include a dedicated subwoofer to enhance bass performance, bringing an extra punch to action scenes and soundtracks.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-ports\">Ports</h3> \n<figure> \n <img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/cfb15b20-e904-11eb-9f99-c08983de4f5c\" /> \n <figcaption></figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>This is a big one. A lot of the more affordable soundbars are limited when it comes to connectivity options. They either offer an optical port or one HDMI jack and, if you're lucky, both. Things get slightly better in the mid-range section, but that's not always the case. The Sonos Beam, for example, is $449, but only has a single HDMI port. Even at the higher-end, the $899 Sonos Arc still only has one HDMI port. If you plan to connect multiple devices like a set-top box, gaming laptop or console directly to your soundbar for the best audio experience, you’ll want an option with at least two HDMI (eARC) inputs. HDMI connections are critical for supporting Dolby Atmos and Dolby Digital audio formats, as well as high-res passthrough for HDR and 8K/4K content.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-channels\">Channels</h3> \n<p>Another big thing you’ll want to pay attention to when looking for the best soundbar is channels. That’s the 2.1, 7.1.2 or other decimal number that companies include in product descriptions. The first figure corresponds to the number of channels. A two would just be left and right while a more robust Atmos system, especially one with rear surround speakers, could be five or seven (left, right, center and upward). The second number refers to the dedicated subwoofer, so if your new soundbar comes with one or has them built in, you’ll see one here. The third numeral is up-firing speakers, important for the immersive effect of Dolby Atmos. Not all Atmos-enabled units have them, but if they do, the third number will tell you how many are in play and how they contribute to the overall soundstage.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-wireless\">Wireless</h3> \n<figure> \n <img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/cff960a0-e904-11eb-ad7a-7525dbfffb3a\" /> \n <figcaption></figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Most soundbars these days offer either Bluetooth, Wi-Fi or both. When it comes to Wi-Fi, that connectivity affords you luxuries like voice control (either built-in or with a separate device), Chromecast, Spotify Connect and AirPlay 2. Depending on your preferences, you might be able to live without some of these. For me, AirPlay 2 and Chromecast are essentials, but the rest I can live without. Those two give me the ability to beam music and podcasts from my go-to apps without having to settle for — or struggle with — a Bluetooth connection. For instance, Sonos speakers often offer seamless integration with iOS devices, making it easy to connect and stream music wirelessly. If you’re looking for a wireless speaker that can enhance your TV setup while also offering flexibility for audio throughout the house, it's worth considering a multi-room system.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-size\">Size</h3> \n<p>This one might seem obvious but humor me for a minute. Nothing is more soul-crushing than getting a pricey soundbar in your living room only to discover you have to rearrange everything to find a spot for it. This was my plight when the<a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B08J99R8WJ&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=e0a90d7f-849e-44f0-bc4d-8672c83d006d&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=Sennheiser+Ambeo+Soundbar&amp;custData=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&amp;signature=AQAAATT-eD3Vxikh1Ox2eB9IcdUDMCrEFQYjLWpCtPt27sw-&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSennheiser-AMBEO-Soundbar-5-1-4-Channel%2Fdp%2FB08J99R8WJ\"> Sennheiser Ambeo Soundbar</a> arrived at my door. Yes, that speaker is absurdly large (and heavy), and most soundbars aren't nearly as big. I learned a valuable lesson: Make sure the space where you want to put a soundbar will accommodate the thing you're about to spend hundreds (if not thousands) of dollars on.</p> \n<p>Basically, it all comes down to the TV you have (or are planning to get) and what the primary goal is for your living-room audio. Is it ease of use? Do you want the best possible sound from a single speaker or speaker/sub combo? Do you just want to be able to actually hear your TV better? Or do you want a full home entertainment experience with crisp vocals, thunderous deep bass, and immersive surround system audio?</p> \n<p>By paying attention to each of those areas, you should have a good idea of what to look for in a soundbar, soundbar/subwoofer combo, Dolby Digital system or a more robust setup. With that said, we've put numerous products through their paces at Engadget and have a few favorites for best soundbar at various price points to get you started.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-other-soundbars-we-tested\">Other soundbars we tested</h2> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-sony-bravia-theater-bar-6\">Sony Bravia Theater Bar 6</h3> \n<p>There’s a lot to like about the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/sony-bravia-theater-bar-6-review-great-sound-greater-frustration-144512450.html\">Bravia Theater Bar 6</a>, Sony’s new midrange option in its soundbar lineup. Sound quality is the speaker’s best attribute, even though it’s limited by its 3.1.2-channel configuration. The biggest two issues with this model are the lack of Wi-Fi connectivity — which means no AirPlay, Chromecast or Spotify Connect — and the need to use your computer and a thumb drive to install firmware updates. Neither of those should be things you have to consider on a $650 soundbar in 2025.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-sonos-arc\">Sonos Arc</h3> \n<p>There’s no doubt that <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/sonos-arc-review-dolby-atmos-soundbar-010039560.html\">the Arc</a> is Sonos’ best-sounding soundbar, but it’s also the company’s most expensive. With a new model based on the Arc <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-11-21/sonos-plans-400-500-headphones-tv-set-top-box-video-roam-2-new-sound-bar\">rumored to be on the way</a>, it’s difficult to recommend this product over the likes of Samsung and Sony. The Arc works well as both a soundbar and a speaker, and the device will fit in nicely with other Sonos gear you might already have for a multiroom setup. It only has one HDMI port though, where much of the competition allows you to connect streaming and gaming devices directly to their soundbars.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-sennheiser-ambeo-soundbar-plus\">Sennheiser Ambeo Soundbar Plus</h3> \n<p>I don’t think <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/sennheiser-ambeo-soundbar-plus-sub-dolby-atmos-170353080.html\">Sennheiser’s medium-sized model</a> offers enough to stand out from the more powerful <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-23-sennheiser-ambeo-soundbar-review.html\">Ambeo Soundbar Max</a> or the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/sennheiser-ambeo-soundbar-mini-review-excellent-and-expensive-183045244.html\">Ambeo Soundbar Mini</a>. The Mini is more affordable and does a solid job with immersive audio in its own right. Like the rest of the Ambeo lineup, there’s no option for satellite speakers as you can only add a subwoofer to the soundbars. However, the Ambeo Soundbar Plus does have RCA input, so you can use it with a turntable if you’re into vinyl.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-best-soundbar-faqs\">Best soundbar FAQs</h2> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-is-a-soundbar-better-than-speakers\">Is a soundbar better than speakers?</h3> \n<p>It really depends on what you’re after. A soundbar is definitely a simpler, more compact solution compared to a full speaker setup. If you want better sound than your TV’s built-in setup but don’t want to deal with multiple speakers and wires everywhere, a soundbar is probably the way to go. Some soundbars can even deliver impressive surround sound effects, thanks to features like Dolby Atmos and virtual audio technology.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>However, if you’re an audiophile or want true surround sound for an at-home theater experience, a multi-speaker setup with a receiver, surround speakers and subwoofer will give you a richer soundstage and more control over your experience.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-what-connection-do-i-need-for-a-soundbar\">What connection do I need for a soundbar?</h3> \n<p>Most modern soundbars connect to your TV via HDMI ARC or eARC, which is the easiest and best option for achieving high-quality audio. If your TV supports this, all you need is an HDMI cable, and you’ll get not only great sound but also some extra features like controlling the soundbar with your TV remote.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>If HDMI ARC isn’t an option on your TV, you can use an optical cable, which also delivers solid audio quality. Some soundbars even offer Bluetooth or Wi-Fi connections for streaming music, and a few still have a 3.5mm aux jack for connecting to older devices.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-do-all-soundbars-come-with-subwoofers\">Do all soundbars come with subwoofers?</h3> \n<p>Not all soundbars come with subwoofers, but many do or at least offer one as an optional add-on that you can purchase separately. A subwoofer is what gives you that deep, booming bass, so if you like action movies or want a fuller sound for music, having one can make a big difference. Some soundbars have a built-in subwoofer, but these generally don’t provide the same punch as a separate one.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/best-soundbars-143041791.html?src=rss"}
