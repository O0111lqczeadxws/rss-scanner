The best noise-canceling headphones block out distractions and let you enjoy your music, podcasts or calls in peace — all while delivering great sound quality and all-day comfort. From models with plush cushions to wireless cans with loads of extra features, there’s something here for every style and budget. Table of contents Best noise-canceling headphones for 2025 How to choose the best noise-canceling headphones for you How we test noise-canceling headphones Other noise-canceling headphones we tested Noise-canceling headphones FAQs Best noise-canceling headphones of 2025 How to choose the best noise-canceling headphones for you Design When you’re shopping for the best wireless headphones, the first thing you’ll need to decide on is wear style. Do you prefer on-ear or over-ear headphones? For the purposes of this guide, I focus on the over-ear style as that’s what most noise-canceling headphones are nowadays. Sure, you can find on-ear models with ANC, but over-ear, active noise-canceling headphones are much more effective at blocking outside sounds since your ears are completely covered. For gamers, there are also gaming headsets that feature noise cancellation — some even have detachable microphones, so they can double as over-ear headphones. However, for the purpose of this article, we’re only going to be focusing on noise-canceling headphones rather than headsets. Look for models with a comfortable headband and memory foam ear cups to ensure you can wear them for long periods without discomfort. Many headphones also come with a range of color options, so if aesthetics matter to you, you’ll find plenty of choices beyond just black or white. Whether you’re looking for something neutral or a bold pop of color, brands now offer a variety of styles to match your personal taste. Finally, if you’re planning to wear your headphones for long periods of time, it’s important to pick a model with a comfortable fit. Memory foam ear cups, an adjustable headband, and lightweight materials can make all the difference during extended listening sessions. After all, great sound is only part of the equation; comfort matters just as much. Type of noise cancellation Next, you’ll want to look at the type of ANC a set of headphones offers. You’ll come across terms like “hybrid active noise cancellation” or “hybrid adaptive active noise cancellation,” and there are key differences between the two. A hybrid ANC setup uses microphones on the inside and on the outside of the device to detect outside noise and cancel it out. By analyzing input from both mics, a hybrid system can combat more sounds than “regular” ANC, but it does so at a constant level that doesn’t change. Adaptive ANC takes the hybrid configuration a step further by continuously adjusting the noise cancellation for changes in your environment and any leakage around the padding of the ear cups. Adaptive noise-canceling also does a better job with wind noise, which can really kill your vibe while using headphones outdoors. Some high-end headphones also support Dolby Atmos, which enhances spatial audio and makes everything from music to movies sound more immersive. For the purposes of this best headphones list, I’m only considering products with hybrid ANC or adaptive ANC setups because those are the most effective at blocking noise and improving your overall listening experience. Customization You’ll also want to check to see if the ANC system on a prospective set of headphones offers adjustable levels of noise cancellation or presets. These can help you dial in the amount of ANC you need for various environments, but it can also help you save battery life. Master & Dynamic, for example, has ANC presets that provide both maximum noise blocking and more efficient cancellation that is more energy efficient. Other companies may include a slider in their companion apps that let you adjust the ANC level to your liking. Some high-end models even allow you to fine-tune the ANC for specific types of environments. How we test noise-canceling headphones The primary way we test headphones is to wear them as much as possible. I prefer to do this over a one-to-two-week period, but sometimes deadlines don’t allow it. During this time, I listen to a mix of music and podcasts , while also using the headphones to take both voice and video calls. Since battery life for headphones can be 30 hours or more, I drain the battery with looping music and the volume set at a comfortable level (usually around 75 percent). Due to the longer battery estimates, I’ll typically power the headphones off several times and leave them that way during a review. This simulates real-world use and keeps me from having to constantly monitor the process for over 24 straight hours. To test ANC performance specifically, I use headphones in a variety of environments, from noisy coffee shops to quiet home offices. When my schedule allows, I use them during air travel since plane noise is a massive distraction to both work and relaxation. Even if I can’t hop on a flight, I’ll simulate a constant roar with white noise machines, bathroom fans, vacuums and more. I also make note of how well each device blocks human voices, which are a key stumbling block for a lot of ANC headphones. ANC-related features are something else to consider. Here, I do a thorough review of companion apps, testing each feature as I work through the software. Any holdovers from previous models are double checked for improvements or regression. If the headphones I’m testing are an updated version of a previous model, I’ll spend time getting reacquainted with the older set. Ditto for the closest competition for each new set of headphones that I review. Other noise-canceling headphones we tested AirPods Max Apple’s AirPods Max are premium, well-designed over-ear headphones that incorporate all of the best features you find on standard AirPods: solid noise cancellation, spatial audio and easy Siri access. However, their $550 starting price makes them almost prohibitively expensive, even for Apple users. There are better options available at lower prices, but if you can pick up the AirPods Max at a steep discount, they might be worthwhile for the biggest Apple fans among us. Dyson On-Trac The On-Trac headphones have an almost infinitely customizable design, and that’s what’s most unique about them. The sound profile offers some nice detail, but lacks dynamic range overall. ANC is average at best and there aren’t any advanced features that will make your life easier. Well, except for the hearing health monitor, which is actually handy. All told, that’s not a lot for a set of $500 headphones. Sonos Ace The Sonos Ace is an excellent debut for the company’s first headphones. The combination of refined design, great sound quality and home theater tricks creates a unique formula. However, ANC performance is just okay and key functionality is still in the works for many users. Sony ULT Wear If most headphones don’t have the level of bass you desire, the ULT Wear is an option to consider. The low-end thump isn’t for everyone, but there are also plenty of handy features and a refined look to make the $200 set more compelling than many in this price range. Beats Studio Pro The Studio Pro lacks basic features like automatic pausing, and multipoint connectivity is only available on Android. Moreover, they’re not very comfortable for people with larger heads. Overall sound quality is improved, though, and voice performance on calls is well above average. Master & Dynamic MH40 (2nd gen) The MH40 are a great set of headphones if you favor crisp, clear and natural sound that isn’t overly tuned. This pair showcases the company’s affinity for leather and metal too, but limited customization and short battery life for non-ANC cans kept this set from making the cut. Bowers & Wilkins Px8 The company’s trademark pristine sound is on display here, but the Px8 is more expensive and not nearly as comfortable as the Px7 S3. Noble Audio FoKus Apollo While this is my top pick for overall sound quality in our main guide to the best wireless headphones , the ANC performance is less impressive than the Px7 S3. Bowers & Wilkins gets the nod here for its improved noise cancellation over the Px7 S2 and Px7 S2e, and its overall excellent audio quality. Noise-canceling headphones FAQs Does noise cancellation block all noise? Noise cancellation doesn’t block out all noise, though it does drastically reduce the volume of most external sounds. Is there a difference between wired vs wireless noise-canceling headphones? In terms of sound quality, if you have two headphones — one wired and one wireless — with similar specs, the difference is going to be very minimal. However, wireless headphones offer more convenience, allowing you to move around more freely with your headphones on, which is why they often feature noise cancellation to minimize external sounds. Does noise cancellation impact sound quality? ANC does bear some weight on sound quality, but the impact of this often doesn’t outweigh the benefits. Noise cancellation reduces ambient noise, allowing a greater focus on audio detail. For audiophiles, however, there may be a small difference in sound fidelity when ANC is turned on.

There is now a race against time to stop this famine from becoming any further entrenched. Every hour counts and there is no time to waste. The international community must take meaningful action and use diplomatic pressure to bring about a permanent ceasefire immediately. The Famine Review Committee (FRC) has determined that Famine (IPC Phase 5) is now occurring in Gaza Governorate. Furthermore, the FRC projects Famine (IPC Phase 5) thresholds to be crossed in Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis Governorates in the coming weeks. As this Famine is entirely human-made, it can be halted and reversed. The time for debate and hesitation has passed, starvation is present and is rapidly spreading. There should be no doubt in anyone’s mind that an immediate, at-scale response is needed. Any further delay-even by days-will result in a totally unacceptable escalation of Famine-related mortality. • If a ceasefire is not implemented to allow humanitarian aid to reach everyone in the Gaza Strip, and if essential food supplies, and basic health, nutrition, and WASH services are not restored immediately, avoidable deaths will increase exponentially.

This release introduces several new features and optimizations, including the default enabling of receipt persistence, a smarter snapshots downloader, and numerous consensus layer improvements and official support for Shutter Network on Gnosis Chain. Breaking changes Port of external RPCDaemon now uses the same WebSocket port as the default for Erigon. ( #15643 ) Docker Images: Docker images are now based on Debian. ( #16228 ) Go Language Version: The required Go version is now golang 1.24. Receipt Persistence: The --persist.receipts flag is now enabled by default (more details are provided below). Pebble Paws will be the last Erigon release series to officially support Polygon. How to upgrade Erigon 3.1 Pebble Paws will work flawlessly with old data. For those who want to ensure they have the absolute latest data files and any recent data-specific fixes, you can optionally perform a manual data upgrade. After upgrading your Erigon binary and having done a back-up of your data directory, just run the command erigon snapshots reset --datadir /your/datadir . Key features Disk Footprint and Management Several improvements furtherly reduced the size of the Ethereum archive nodes while actually storing more data, making the nodes more cost-effective and easier to manage: The --persist.receipts flag is now enabled by default for Full and Minimal nodes. This downloads pre-calculated receipts, ensuring a consistent and predictable latency, meaning a more reliable system when interacting with the network, especially during high-traffic periods, and a 10x faster RPC for calls like eth_getLogs . The size of the receipts is 300 GB for the Ethereum mainnet, 1 TB for the Polygon bor-mainnet, and 200 GB for the Gnosis Network. However, this can be disabled with the command --persist.receipts=false . In this case, the RPC calls will generate receipts on demand from the StateHistory. ( #16040 ). The size of .ef files was reduced by 50% with better encoding, resulting in smaller archive nodes. ( #12907 ) Rolled out phase 1 of history expiry, allowing nodes to drop pre-merge data, which significantly reduces storage requirements and simplifies node maintenance. ( #15668 ) Efficiently upgrade the existing data using the new snapshots update and snapshots reset commands , reducing node downtime and resource usage while avoiding a full re-sync. Several optimization have been implemented to reduce latency, lower disk I/O, and optimize VM and snapshot operations, resulting in faster, more efficient node operation and easier maintenance ( #14135 , #14902 , #15115 , #15092 , #16140 ). Networking and Performance Faster and more reliable syncing: the new Bittorrent web seed implementation downloads entire files in a single stream instead of making many small-range HTTP requests, resulting in faster syncing, reduced server load, improved CDN compatibility, and enhanced protection against DDoS attacks. The downloader now automatically switches sources if the snapshot set becomes inaccessible, and once the snapshot files are downloaded, they are marked as read-only to prevent accidental corruption. Torrent logging and status outputs have been upgraded, offering clearer real-time insights into sync speed, estimated completion times, and the root causes of any synchronization stalls. ( #15043 ) A new configuration flag now enables independent tuning of web seeding and peer-to-peer (P2P) download speeds, delivering more control over how data is sourced and transferred. ( #15912 ) Improved and more reliable experience with faster, more accurate RPC responses, improved error handling, and broader support for new features and tools. ( #13795 , #13947 , #14075 , #14093 , #14105 , #14152 , #14803 , #14915 , #14994 , #15948 , #16029 , #16101 ) Smoother Polygon Network experiences with faster syncing, improved reliability, and better compatibility, thanks to a series of targeted bug fixes and optimizations. ( #14056 , #14080 , #13845 , #13807 , #15595 , #16160 , #16035 , #15538 ) The new probabilistic filter makes historical queries much faster and more efficient. ( #15960 ) Protocol Improved Caplin (Consensus Layer) reliability and performance with enhanced slot processing, better peer management, optimized block and attestation handling, new validator deposit toolingAore efficient reorg support. These updates provide smoother network participation, easier validator operations, and improved responsiveness.

It also implements various Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) related to blobs and gas, ensuring compatibility with upcoming network changes. ( #13975 , #15420 ) Added support for the latest protocol upgrades and features—delivering improved compatibility, security, and performance for users. ( #14705 , #14702 , #14672 , #15093 , #15148 , #15450 , #15067 , #15399 , #15519 , #15532 , #15609 , #15688 , #14213 ) Shutter Network Official support for Shutter Network has been added to Erigon Validators on Gnosis Chain, helping prevent malicious Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) attacks by enabling the use of encrypted transactions. ( #13725 , #13864 , #13865 , #13983 , #14187 , #16505 , #16554 , #16561 , #16592 , #16590 ) Further information can be found at https://github.com/erigontech/erigon/tree/release/3.1/txnprovider/shutter#shutter QA and Testing Improvemend testing and QA to deliver more reliable releases and higher quality software by expanding automated testing, enforcing stricter failure checks, and enhancing test coverage for every commit.

But the base-model Kindle is also good, offering a cheap and easy entry point into ebooks. And Boox makes a few E Ink readers that do more than just display books. Now that most ereader companies also offer color models, the field is wider than ever. In short, there are a few things to consider before buying your next (or first) ereader and this guide covers product recommendations alongside advice on how to get the most out of your new device. Table of contents Best ereaders What to look for in an ereader How to get books for your ereader How we test ereaders Ereader FAQs Recent updates The best ebook readers for 2025 What to look for in an ereader Plenty of apps, including the Kindle app, will let you download and read digital books on an iPhone, Android Phone or tablet. But what makes ebook readers different is the screen: nearly all of them use technology from a company called E Ink. It manufactures electronic paper displays (EPD) composed of three sheets: one containing millions of microcapsules filled with black and white ink particles sandwiched between transparent electrode layers. When a charge is applied, either the black or white particles shift to the top, forming letters and the whitespace around them. Color ereaders add a color filter array on top of the standard black and white microcapsule layer. The result is two different resolutions on one screen — the color clarity is 150 dpi while black and white images and text are still 300 dpi. Because these displays are so different from standard backlight LED panels, you can expect most good ereaders to do a number of things well. They’ll be easier to stare at for long periods of time and easier to read in direct sunlight. Also, since E Ink displays only require power to rearrange the ink, these devices have much longer battery lives than even the best tablets: we’re talking weeks on a single charge, not days. The ereader market is not as saturated as, say, the smartphone market, but there are still plenty of options out there and they do have small but important differences among them. They tend to range from around $100 to more than $400, though usually the higher end options are stylus-enabled read/write E Ink tablets like the Kindle Scribe. Beyond price, you should consider physical properties like buttons, lights, storage and resolution, as well as how the software lets you find and access books. Reading features With any ereader, you’ll navigate the OS via taps and swipes, and some add physical page-turn buttons. Most with built-in buttons have an auto-rotating screen so you can press with your right or left hand. As E Ink technology has advanced, resolution has greatly improved – even the budget Kindle ereader has a 300 ppi display. You can still find models with lower resolution, but we don’t recommend them. Some ereaders have front LEDs that support light temperature adjustment. That means you can switch to a warmer light after the sun goes down, which will feel easier on the eyes. If you’re concerned about blue light, you should go for a reader with that feature. Finally, dark mode is available on most later model ereaders, allowing you to invert the black and white text and background, which some people find easier to read in low-light settings. Other features The capabilities of these pocket libraries have advanced considerably since the early days. In addition to storing books, some let you browse the web, run apps and play music. The screen’s frame rate can’t handle gaming, but it’s good enough to show you the Wikipedia entry for Striver’s Row while you read Crook Manifesto . If you listen to audiobooks, you may want a Bluetooth-enabled ereader capable of playing them. Most of the models we tested have that ability, with the notable exception of the Nook ereader we tried. Keep in mind that audiobook files can take up more space than print files so you'll probably want a device with a higher storage capacity if you plan on doing a lot of listening. Above all, you should consider where and how you intend to find books to read. Most ereaders make it easiest to shop through their own digital bookstores, but all of them (even Kindles ) will now let you download titles from other sources, like libraries, unaffiliated ebook sellers and free public domain sites. Photo by Amy Skorheim / Engadget How to get books for your ereader Kindle, Nook and Kobo all have their own stores that you access directly from each brand’s devices. Prices are the same among all sellers, too. Publishers set the price of an ebook, not the retailer, so a title will cost the same at Amazon, Barnes & Noble, eBooks.com and the Kobo store. Amazon offers Kindle Unlimited for $12 per month, and it includes four million titles from which you can pick your next read. It includes audio and ebooks, but you won’t find many big, new releases or older bestsellers. Kobo has a subscription called Kobo Plus with about 1.3 million titles: it goes for $8 per month for ebooks only, $8 for audiobooks only or $10 for both. Buying a book from a proprietary store instantly delivers it to your device, provided you’re connected to WiFi. It also syncs your reading across devices and apps, so you can pick up where you left off on your phone if you forgot your ereader at home. It truly is the most convenient way to go, but if you don’t want to be locked into one brand’s store, or if you opt for an ereader without its own marketplace, you do have options. How to upload ePubs onto an ereader Stores like ebooks.com and Google Play have millions of ebooks for sale as digital rights-managed (DRM) ePub files, which Kobo, Nook and PocketBook readers can read in their native ereader apps. Kindles don’t support DRM ePub files at all and Boox devices require third party reading apps (of which there are many) to read those files. Titles from Apple Books are only readable in iOS devices. Titles from some publishers like Tor and public domain classics from sites like Project Gutenberg are also sold as ePubs, but without the added DRM. Consequently, Kindles and the Boox Neoreader do support those files. Books you get from third-party sources will look just like ones you bought from a proprietary store, thanks to the flowable, formatted nature of ePub files. While these device-agnostic ebook collections give you extra options for finding your next read, they require a few additional steps to get the files onto your ereader. To do so, you’ll typically need a computer running a free program called Adobe Digital Editions (ADE). After buying and downloading the ePub file, open ADE and plug your ereader into your computer (all readers here have a USB-C port for charging and data transfers). Your device should pop up in the left panel. Drag and drop the ePub file from your downloads folder into the main panel in ADE. The file will display as an image of the book cover. Drag that image onto your device on the left panel. If the file includes digital rights management (which protects against unauthorized copying) you’ll need to authorize your ereader, which requires using or creating a free Adobe ID . Once you’ve finished adding files to upload, eject the reader from your computer to complete the transfer process. Kindles use a web-based uploader instead of the ADE method. But since Kindle uses its own proprietary DRM technology instead of Adobe's, the only files it can accept from third parties are non-DRM files, such as from Tor Publishing or Project Gutenberg. After downloading a compatible ePub file, drag and drop it into your browser with the Send to Kindle page open. As long as you’re signed into Amazon, this wirelessly transfers the files to your associated device. Boox also uses a browser uploader called BooxDrop (along with many other methods ) to deliver ePubs to the device. Open it from the Boox App menu and you’ll see a device-specific url. Type that into your browser to access a file delivery portal that uploads to your library. Boox’s built-in ereader app, NeoReader, also doesn’t support files with DRM, so you won’t be able to read current titles from most publishers using that app. Fortunately, Boox devices run nearly every ereader app out there, Kobo and Kindle included, letting you access ePubs any number of ways. Recently, Bookshop.org, the online seller of physical books that supports indie bookstores, started selling ebooks and up to 100 percent of the profits will go to local booksellers. The company uses a different rights management system than ADE so, right now, you can only read titles you buy from them on the Bookshop.org app , but the company is working with the makers of both Kindle and Kobo to extend compatibility to those ereaders. How to read library books on an ereader Your local library card lets you borrow audio and ebooks through a program called Overdrive and its companion app Libby . On a Kobo , you have have built-in access to Overdrive in a separate tab. Once you’ve linked your public library card, the search function will include results for titles available from your local library system; a few taps will upload your selections to your device for the length of the loan. I personally find it easiest to borrow the title I want through the Libby app on my phone. After that, the book pops up on my Kobo’s home screen once the device syncs. To read library books on a Kindle , you can either go through the Libby app or the Overdrive section of your library’s website. Once you click Borrow, you’ll see the option to “Read now with Kindle,” which takes you to Amazon’s site to sign in. After that, the book will be delivered to your device the next time it connects to WiFi. For other ereaders, you’ll go through your library’s Overdrive portal and download the ePub after clicking the Borrow button. You can then use the ADE process we described above. Devices that run external apps, like Boox's Page, Go Color 7 or Palma, allow you to read library books via the Libby app, just as you would on a smartphone or iPad. You can also use the Libby app to borrow audiobooks, but you won’t be able to access them through your ereader. (The exception is an ereader, like a Boox device, that allows external apps). I found it was easier to listen to an audiobook on my phone anyway, regardless of whether I borrowed it through Libby or bought it from Kindle or Kobo. Photo by Amy Skorheim / Engadget How we test ereaders When putting together any guide, the first thing we do is spend hours researching the field. We look at what’s available, what’s new, and what shoppers and professional reviewers have to say. Then we narrow a list to the best candidates for hands-on testing. Over the course of the past two years, I’ve tested just over a dozen ereaders, representing five different brands: Amazon, Kobo, Barnes & Noble, Boox and PocketBook. I bought, borrowed and uploaded books for each device using the methods above. I used each one for between a few days to a few months. I evaluated each one in the areas of book access, ease of reading, extra features and overall value. Here’s everything we tested so far: Amazon Kindle (2022) Amazon Kindle (2024) Amazon Kindle Paperwhite (2021) Amazon Kindle Paperwhite Signature (2024) Boox Go Color 7 Boox Leaf 2 Boox Page Boox Poke 5 Boox Palma Kobo Libra 2 Kobo Libra Colour Kobo Clara 2E Kobo Clara Colour Kobo Nia NOOK GlowLight 4 PocketBook Era Other ereaders we tested Amazon Kindle Colorsoft Amazon’s first color Kindle impressed with its quick page-turns and load times, auto-adjusting front light and, of course, a decently striking color E Ink display. But at $280, it’s more expensive than all of the other color ereaders in its size range, including the Kobo Libra Colour and the Boox Go Color 7. Also, some Colorsoft owners reported seeing a yellow band at the bottom of their ereader’s display. This issue did not affect our first review unit during the original testing period, but it eventually appeared. An Amazon spokesperson told Engadget: \"A small number of customers have reported a yellow band along the bottom of the display. We take the quality of our products seriously—customers who notice this can reach out to our customer service team for a replacement or refund, and we’re making the appropriate adjustments to ensure that new devices will not experience this issue moving forward.\" Amazon sent us a new Colorsoft ereader at the end of 2024 and it does appear that the fixes the company made resolved the yellow-band issue. The screen on our second review unit appears warmer overall, but not overly so. It’s more akin to the screen on the Kobo Libra Colour, and that’s a good thing. Boox Go 7 stylus-enabled ereader Boox recently released two new stylus-enabled generations of their seven-inch reader: The monochrome Go 7 and a color-screen Go Color 7 (Gen II) . After trying out the stylus-enabled Go 7, I still like the standard, non-stylus enabled version better. True, I liked the Notebook app with its array of handwriting templates and I appreciated the low-to-no latency with the stylus. It also offers a good assortment of brush, pen and style options. But outside of the Notebook app, I didn’t find much use for the stylus. I was able to doodle in the margins of DRM-free books in Boox’s native NeoReader, but it doesn’t work in other apps or on any rights-managed books. There's a FreeMark option that allows you to draw or write atop any app, but it saves your doodles as separate images, as opposed to allowing you to mark up the page itself. I also found enabling the stylus to be a little glitchy. If you plan to do a lot of writing, you’ll probably be better served by an E Ink tablet , but if you want an ereader that can mark up your books, I suggest going with the Kobo Libra Color, detailed above. Ereader FAQs What's the difference between an ereader and an e-ink reader? Really, they are the same thing. E Ink is a company that designs and manufactures the paper-like screens found in most ereader devices. Technically, anything you read ebooks on can act as an ereader, so your phone, iPad or Android tablet could all serve that purpose, but they’re not considered dedicated ereaders. While there are some devices marketed as ereaders that have LCD or OLED screens instead of E Ink, they aren’t as common. One of the benefits of ereaders is the E Ink screen’s paper-like quality, which causes less eye strain for many people. But there is a difference between ereaders and E Ink tablets . These larger e-ink devices also employ E Ink screens, but they have stylus input and are often used for note taking and other tasks in addition to reading ebooks. We have an entire guide devoted to helping you pick out an E Ink tablet . Are there ads on my ereader? The base model Kindle and Kindle Paperwhite come with ads by default, but you can opt to pay $20 to remove them, either at the time of purchase or after you start using the device. The ads are limited to the lockscreen and are typically for other books or Kindle services. Kobo and Boox ereaders don’t come with ads. Which ereader has the longest battery life? Of the devices we tested, the Boox Go Color 7 has the largest listed battery capacity at 2,300mAh (Amazon doesn’t list the capacity of its Kindle devices). But thanks to the nature of E Ink screens and the relatively limited processing power required to display e-books, nearly all ereaders can go for weeks before they need a recharge. That means battery life probably isn’t as much of a deciding factor in buying an ereader as it would be with a tablet or smartphone. Which ereaders can read Kindle books? Amazon’s Kindle ereaders are the obvious answer, but other devices capable of running apps can also read titles from the Kindle store. For example, you can download the Kindle app on a Boox ereader through Google Play (the store comes standard in the Boox app menu). You can then sign into your Kindle account and access all the books in your library — the same way you’d read Kindle books on your phone or tablet. Can you buy Kindle books without a Kindle? Yes. You can buy Kindle books through the Kindle app or through Amazon’s website via a browser. You can read those titles on a Kindle or any device that can run the Kindle app, such as a smartphone, tablet or computer. Just be aware that Kindle titles can only be read through one of Amazon’s ereaders or the Kindle app. The company uses proprietary digital rights management on all ebooks it sells that can’t be read by other ereader apps like Kobo or Adobe ADE. What's the difference between Kindle and Kobo? Both Kindle and Kobo are brands of dedicated ereaders that support searching, buying, downloading and reading ebooks from their own stores. Both also support borrowing books from your local library via Overdrive and Libby. The difference is that Kindle is owned by Amazon and uses the Kindle store, whereas Kobo is owned by Rakuten and its books come from the Kobo store. Both stores come pre-loaded as a tab on their respective ereader and both carry most in-print books. Each store also carries their own exclusive ebooks as well, but Amazon’s library of Kindle-only books is much larger than Kobo’s . Amazon also offers Amazon Original stories to read on the Kindle, which are free short fiction and nonfiction reads that are free to Prime members. Which ereader is best for library books? Both Kobos and Kindles have simple systems for borrowing library books. Other ereaders, like Boox, let you borrow books after downloading the Libby App. Only Kobo ereaders let you search for and borrow books directly on the ereader, with a dedicated Overdrive tab. Kindles, on the other hand, utilize a convenient “read on Kindle” function from the Libby app or website. You can send a borrowed book to your Kindle just by signing into your account. Both methods are pretty easy, so which is the best for you probably depends on other factors than just the library-book feature.

According to the PA news agency, when asked if Scottish Tory leader Russell Findlay is the right person for the job and whether he should stay in the post, he said: Clearly I’m no longer a member of the party so that’s no longer a decision for me to make. I get on very well as an individual with Russell, I think he’s a good individual. Whether he’s the person to lead the Scottish Conservatives is obviously for MSPs, for the membership, to decide. What I’m very clear about is that those with disabilities, other minorities and the people of Lothian need a voice for people to hear what we require within our country. I’m not sure any party is actually offering that at the moment but whether I stand or not I’ll come to a view in the next few weeks. It’s the party that’s moved, not me. We are disappointed to read these comments but grateful for Jeremy’s service and wish him well. The Scottish Conservatives, under Russell Findlay’s leadership, recognise that many people feel completely disconnected from politics. It is absolutely critical that our party continues to champion commonsense Conservative values and policies that focus on the issues of concern to hard-working Scots.

According to The Information , the company told Arizona-based Amkor Technology and Samsung Electronics to put a pause on their work for the H20. Amkor produces advanced packaging for the H20 chips, while Samsung supplies memory for NVIDIA. Reuters has also reported that NVIDIA asked Foxconn, which is in charge of backend processing for the chip, to suspend its work. \"We constantly manage our supply chain to address market condition,\" the company told CNBC in a statement when asked to comment about the supposed production pause. The US government had blocked NVIDIA from selling the H20 in China back in April, out of concerns that the country could use it to develop AI tech for its military. It allowed the company to resume selling the chip in China by July, reportedly after closing a deal that would give it 15 percent of the sales. But China didn't welcome the H20 with open arms. Local regulators instructed the biggest Chinese tech companies, including ByteDance and Alibaba to stop new orders for H20 chips, citing security concerns. The Cyberspace Administration of China talked to NVIDIA, claiming that AI experts had revealed that the chips could be tracked and controlled remotely. NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang had admitted that Chinese regulators asked him about the supposed \"backdoor\" and said that he made it clear it didn't exist. \"Hopefully the response that we've given to the Chinese government will be sufficient,\" Huang said. A recent report by the Financial Times , however, claimed that Chinese authorities didn't issue warnings against using NVIDIA chips just because of security concerns. Apparently, they found certain remarks by US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick \"insulting.\" When the US allowed shipments of the H20 to China again, Lutnick said during an interview: \"We don't sell them our best stuff, not our second best stuff, not even our third best. The fourth one down, we want to keep China using it... You want to sell the Chinese enough that their developers get addicted to the American technology stack.\" The H20 is currently the most advanced AI chip NVIDIA can sell in the Chinese market, but the company is reportedly developing a more powerful product. It will be based on the company's Blackwell architecture, Reuters previously reported, and will be capable of half the computing power of NVIDIA's Blackwell Ultra GPUs.

I’m typically skeptical of the current generation of AI, but as I checked out the new software across various demo sessions, I found myself more and more intrigued. It seems like Google, along with Apple and Samsung, has been working on making these AI-powered updates more helpful in a way that might actually make our lives easier or simply more fun. There wasn’t enough time to write up every single one of them, so I’ve put a few of my favorites in this story to give you a better sense of what to expect when the Pixel 10 series hits retail shelves later this month. Spoiler alert: Many of these have to do with voice and calls — an area Google has historically excelled at. The Recorder app can generate backing music I have long been enamored with Google’s Recorder app . It started with the on-device transcription that made getting quotes from my interviews easy and relatively secure. But when Apple introduced a multi-track recording function to its Voice Memos app , I quickly jumped ship. While the iOS recorder has inferior transcription in terms of accuracy and readability, the fact that I could basically record a duet with myself seriously appealed to the musical theater geek in me. I played both Elphaba and Glinda, crooning their parts from “For Good” into my iPhone. But when Google’s senior director of product management for Pixel software Shenaz Zack told me the Pixel 10’s recorder app would add AI-generated music to your singing, I went silent in slight disbelief. I spent much of my youth ripping karaoke tracks from YouTube videos, looking up “minus one” or “backing tracks” or “instrumentals only” on various download platforms. My friends and I were aspiring performers, looking to mix our own covers of popular songs, and a tool that would generate backing music to our voice tracks would have been a dream come true. Honestly it kind of still is. Zack walked me through the process twice — on my first try I sang a verse and part of the chorus of “Golden” from the Kpop Demon Hunters soundtrack. I giggled self-consciously at the end, before Zack hit stop. As it recorded, the app actually showed a tag that indicated it knew I was singing, and when we selected the recording after, a chip appeared saying “Create and add music.” Tapping that brought up a panel titled “Choose a vibe to create music” with two sections: Featured vibes and Your vibes. Under the first one, the options were “Chill beats,” “Cozy,” “Dance party,” “Rainy day blues,” “Romantic” and “Surprise me.” On my second attempt, when I rushed through a rendition of the all-time banger “Mary Had a Little Lamb,” the app displayed a warning at the bottom that said “The beat might not match well if the recording is short.” I chose Dance Party, hit next, and waited a minute or so while Recorder went to work. The animation at the top said the system was analyzing the audio, identifying the rhythm, locking onto the beat and harmonizing the track before delivering the result. I don’t quite know what I was expecting, but I can say that those who were at all concerned about digital rights management have nothing to worry about. The music that Google generated for “Golden” sounded nothing like the original, and while it did make my voice sound less lonely and made for a more complete track, I felt like I needed a few more adjustments to feel satisfied with it. As for “Mary Had a Little Lamb,” the result was as generic as expected for an AI-generated soundtrack to a very basic nursery rhyme. To Google’s credit, what came out seemed to be in the right key and rhythm, and I certainly will need much more time playing around with this to see if tweaking the settings will help. I also wanted to point out that the generated music also stopped as my singing stopped, so the giggling I mentioned earlier was not scored. Although this feature did not live up to my (admittedly unrealistic) fantasy, I do think it’s a fun use of AI and seems harmless. It’s not going to be a mainstay of most people’s daily routines, although Zack did say that a large percent of people actually used Recorder for singing. This update could certainly make for a nice little dose of musical creativity. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Engadget (@engadget) Voice Translate made it sound like I was speaking German I had more concerns around the Voice Translate feature that was supposed to make you or your caller sound like you were speaking in a different language. According to Google, the goal is to “break down language barriers during phone calls.” When I asked Zack why the company felt the need to make the voice resemble the caller’s, she said it was about personal connection. Zack explained that her parents live in India, and though they speak English, they’re not very fluent. That makes for some difficulty when they call Zack’s kids. Simply adding a robotic voice that’s translating between the grandparents and the children wouldn’t feel right, either. I was initially skeptical that fully replacing the caller’s original voice with a translated version would help, but after a few demos, I am certainly swayed. To be clear, the person placing the call has to do so from a Pixel phone for Voice Translate to work. Once you choose Voice Translate from the Call Assist submenu, you’ll have to choose a language. When the call is connected, the system will say to both parties that the “Call is translated by Google AI in each speaker’s voice. Audio is not saved.” I tried this out a few times with a Google representative who spoke German, whom we will refer to as “Uncle Tim” to make it easier for me to describe this demo. Each time he spoke, I could hear a couple seconds of his voice in German, before a chime played and the version in the original language became softer. What sounded like a dubbed actor playing Uncle Tim came on and conversed in English, complete with realistic replications of pitch, rhythm and expression. I also could hear feedback when I talked on the call, so I heard myself speaking German on the other end. It was truly strange, because it sort of did sound like me. One of my closest friends lives in Germany, and has had to put up with my attempts to learn German for more than 10 years. I immediately wanted to try Voice Translate on her to see if she would believe I had suddenly become fluent (but of course, I’d have to figure out how to get her to ignore the warnings that Google AI was at work). I’ll be honest, the experience wasn’t perfect. Not only were the translations sometimes off (some of what Uncle Tim said in English didn’t make sense), the generated voices seemed less like a complete replication of the caller and more like a novice dubbing artist. That’s not a bad thing, since I was very concerned about impersonation being a problem. To that end, Zack said Google was deliberate about the implementation. She reminded me of the “ducking” that was in place, which is when the original speech is still audible in the first few seconds and then softer throughout. Like the original audio is ducking below the dubbed voice — get it? And I remembered that while the AI voice might sound sort of like me, it isn’t designed to simply make up things I’m saying — it’s just translating the content. I’m the one that decides whether to go off and curse out a relative and have that conveyed in their native tongue, for example. Of course, there may still be bugs and quirks to work out. I was amused by the various accents that came through in the English-speaking version of Uncle Tim. At first he sounded American, but in subsequent conversations he took on an Australian accent. All this is powered by the Pixel 10’s Tensor G5 chip and processed on-device using “a new codec and semantic understanding,” according to Zack, to understand the speaker’s vocal expressions. For now, I see what Google is going for and cannot wait to call my friend in Frankfurt. At launch, Voice Translate will support translating to or from English with Spanish, German, Japanese, French, Hindi, Italian, Portuguese, Swedish, Russian and Indonesian. Google/Screenshot by Engadget Magic Cue surfacing your flight info when you call your airline is helpful The recorder app, translation and expressive-sounding AI are areas Google has long proven expertise in. And lest we forget, the company has also been a pioneer in suggesting actions from your emails and adding events to your calendar by scanning your inbox. With the Pixel 10’s Magic Cue feature, Google is basically bringing this functionality to your texts and calls. While Magic Cue can helpfully show shortcuts within the Messages app to help you answer questions about reservations or send photos from recent trips, I’m most into one specific aspect. When you call an airline to make changes to a flight, for instance, the Pixel 10 can pull up your reservation information and display it within the call, so you won’t have to open your email, and search for the booking confirmation to have your reference number ready. Sure, it might only save you seconds, but it’s so much easier, and Google already does a version of this in your inbox. I would love to see this particular feature expand and cover other types of appointments so you can quickly get codes or other identifying information during calls to, say, your plumber, doctor, insurance provider and more. Camera and photo features continue to improve Google continues to improve upon areas it’s led the way in, and photography remains a strength of Pixel phones. The company was one of the first major players to use its algorithmic prowess to dramatically improve the quality of low light photos and with the Pixel 10 Pro it again uses computational processing to deliver superior images. Pro Res Zoom on the new phone did manage to produce some surprisingly clean pictures of faraway buildings, at least in my demo at Google’s Manhattan office. I was impressed by how clear the lines on the underside of a skyscraper that we zoomed to a 100x level on looked. Google was also careful to clarify that Pro Res Zoom won’t work on people, and that distant text may look odd. \"We've tuned Pro Res Zoom to minimize hallucinations, however they may still occur — especially with faraway text. Additionally, when Pro Res Zoom detects a person in the scene, we use a different enhancement algorithm that prevents inaccurate representations,\" according to Google. in those situations, the algorithm will drop to Super Res Zoom quality. Depending on which Pixel phone you’re using, Super Res Zoom delivers up to either 20x or 30x zoom. In the results I saw, people standing on a deck at the top of a tower just seemed a bit pixelated compared to the building’s facade, and the effect wasn’t jarring or even really noticeable until I zoomed in. But that might be because they were a tiny part of the picture — I imagine things would look different if a person was the main subject in a scene. As someone who enjoys composing pictures, I didn’t think the Camera Coach feature would do anything for me. But I was pleasantly surprised that I actually liked some of the AI’s proposed framing options. I still don’t think I’ll use this much in the real world, but it might help other people who want tips on photography. I was initially nonplussed about the new Photos feature that lets you tell the AI how to edit your pictures, but after a brief demo I came around. Simply telling Gemini to “turn that red dress blue” or “get rid of the people in the background” was not only easier, but suprrisingly effective. I also want to point out that Google also made tweaks to the Guided Frame feature in its camera app that helps those who are blind or visually impaired know what is in the scene. It now uses Gemini models, which should help with object recognition. Finally, it’s worth calling out the support for C2PA content authenticity initiative . Google is building this into the Photos app, where metadata will show whether or not AI was used in a picture. The Pixel 10 phones will be the first to implement the new industry-standard Content Credentials (CR) within its native camera app, and companies like Adobe, Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, OpenAI are all part of the initiative. An assortment of other updates worthy of mention Those were just a slice of the new AI-related features I was impressed by at my recent demos ahead of Google’s event this week. But there are quite a few more I found promising, like visual overlays in Gemini Live and the new Pixel Journal app. I didn’t spend as much time with either, but they worked in my brief demos. So did the “take a message” feature that will send transcriptions of voicemails to you, which seems like a much better way to be alerted to a missed call than a hidden section of the Phone app. I’m not yet sold on the Daily Hub, which is basically an updated version of the existing pages that sit to the left of the home page showing relevant actions and articles you might want to explore. I’m fairly intentional when it comes to looking for things to consume, and have specific apps I prefer for doomscrolling (Reddit over everything), so I’m not sure Daily Hub will suit me. Still, the fact that I liked the bulk of the new AI features coming to the Pixel 10 series is pretty significant. Of course, I will still reserve judgement until I can spend more time with them in the real world, and hope to write reviews of some of them. But it’s clear from my time with demos of the Pixel 10 that Google has been pretty thoughtful about how it imbues its hardware with AI, and I hope its competitors take notes.

However, not all companies receiving funds under the same program will need to give up equity, The Wall Street Journal has reported. Companies like TSMC and Micron that increased their US investments won't have any additional obligations, according to a government official familiar with the matter. Ealier, commerce secretary Howard Lutnick appeared to royally screw NVIDIA with comments about the company's H20 AI chips, and may have also rubbed chip giant TSMC the wrong way. \"The Biden administration literally was giving Intel [money] for free, and giving TSMC money for free, and all these companies, just giving them money for free,\" he told CNBC on Tuesday. \"Donald Trump turns that into saying, 'Hey, we want equity for the money. If we’re going to give you the money, we want a piece of the action.'\" However, TSMC may have noticed the Intel equity kerfuffle and executives reportedly held preliminary discussions about handing back subsidies if the US government asks to become a shareholder, according to the WSJ 's sources. TSMC was awarded $6.6 billion for its Arizona plant that started producing chips late last year for Apple and others. However, the company recently said it would invest another $100 billion over the next four years to build three more fabrication plants, two advanced packaging facilities and a major research and development center. Because of that extra investment, the Trump administration won't ask for a piece of TSMC or Micron (which also expanded its US facilities in Idaho, New York and Virginia). \"The Commerce Department is not looking to take equity from TSMC and Micron,\" an unnamed official said. In any case, attempts by the US government to take equity in companies will likely face legal challenges due to language in the contracts. Companies are already required to share revenue with the US government if profits rise above a certain amount. In another development, the US government may divert up to $2 billion in CHIPS Act funding toward critical minerals projects in the US, Reuters reported. The move aims to reduce US dependence on China for key minerals extensively used in the electronics and defense industries. \"The administration is creatively trying to find ways to fund the critical minerals sector,\" Reuters' source said, adding that those plans could change.

It also marks a good time to check out the tech deals available across the web. While seasonal holidays like Memorial Day and Labor Day are not the boon for tech sales that shopping events like Amazon Prime Day are, they can present good opportunities to save on things like laptops, tablets, smart home gear and more. Here, we've curated the best Labor Day sales on tech we could find this year. Since this time of year does overlap with the back-to-school season, students should be first in line to check out these deals. If you need some new gadgets for college, or refreshed tech to help you out in your first job after graduating, now's the time to see if you can get it for less. Student discounts are handy and exclusive to those who can prove their student status, but the good thing about Labor Day sales is that anyone can take advantage of them — student ID not required. Best Labor Day sales: Engadget's top picks Apple AirPods Pro 2 for $169 (32 percent off): The AirPods Pro 2 are Apple’s best set of wireless earbuds for now, as they offer the full set of Apple-focused features, strong ANC, onboard volume controls, a comfy in-ear design and a warm sound profile that most should find agreeable. They can even work as a hearing aid , though their six-hour battery life still isn’t the best, and you should only get them if you’re all-in on Apple hardware. But if that’s the case, we consider them the best wireless earbuds for iPhone owners. Apple Mac mini M4 for $499 ($100 off): The newest version of Apple’s tiny desktop PC has a smaller overall footprint, a faster M4 chip, 16GB of RAM as standard, two front-facing USB-C ports, an extra Thunderbolt 4 port and the ability to drive three external displays.

Google Pixel 10 smartphone + $100 Amazon gift card for $799 ($100 off): More of a pre-order deal than a Labor Day deal, this bundle includes a free gift card when you order the latest Google Pixel phone in advance.

That combined with their weather-proof design allows you to place them both inside and outside. Eufy 11S Max robot vacuum for $150 (46 percent off): This model is one of our favorite budget robot vacuums thanks to its slim design that lets you get underneath furniture more easily and strong suction power for its size. Note that it does not have Wi-Fi connectivity, but it comes with a remote that lets you control the robot to your liking. Shark AI Ultra robot vacuum for $298 (50 percent off): This Shark robot vacuum is a version of one of our favorites and it comes with a auto-empty base that can hold up to 60 days worth of debris. It has strong suction power and home mapping capabilities, so you can tailor cleaning jobs to your liking in addition to putting the robot on a cleaning schedule. Cosori 9-in-1 air fryer for $90 (25 percent off): One of our picks for the best air fryers , this Cosori model has a spacious six-quart cooking basket and nine prep modes to choose from. In our testing, it consistently crisped up all kinds of foods, from frozen appetizers to raw proteins, and it has a nifty safety feature with its built-in basket release button. HORI Piranha Plant camera for Switch 2 for $40 (33 percent off): If you plan on taking advantage of the Switch 2's video and group chat feature, there's no cuter way to do it than with this Piranha Plant camera. In addition to using it with the pot as a stand, the plant itself detaches from the pot so you can use the camera in portable mode with the USB port on the new console. ESPN Unlimited with Disney+ and Hulu (with ads) for $30/month ($6/month off): ESPN’s new streaming service is officially available now, and new subscribers can get Disney+ and Hulu included for one year when they sign up.

Whenever you're previewing a video in Google Drive, you may see an \"Open\" button in the top right of the screen. Clicking this opens the clip in Google Vids , where you can trim the video, add text and music and make other changes. Veo is available in the app too. After you open a file in Vids, a new file is created, and you'll have to save or export that if need be. Google for Education has a free course detailing how to use Vids . Google In general, it seems like a useful way to edit videos that you've already uploaded to Drive, but there are some caveats here. For one thing, it's restricted to paid users, including those on various Workspace business and enterprise plans, nonprofits and those with the Gemini Education or Gemini Education Premium add-ons. Google AI Pro and Ultra users will get access as well. So too will anyone who bought the Gemini Business and Enterprise add-ons before Google discontinued them earlier this year. Vids will be enabled for supported organizations by default unless they've opted to block access to Google Docs. This Google Vids feature works on the latest couple of versions of Chrome, Firefox and Microsoft Edge (Windows only). Compatibility on other browsers may vary. MP4, Quicktime, OGG and WebM videos are supported, with individual clips having limits of 35 minutes of runtime and a file size of 4GB.

Right now in the lead-up to Labor Day, the 2025 13- and 15-inch MacBook Air M4 are available on Amazon for record-low prices. The 13-inch model is our pick for best MacBook to buy this year, and it's one of the best laptops for college students going back to school soon as well. You can pick up the 13-inch MacBook Air M4 for $799, down from $999 — a 20 percent discount. This model comes with 16GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD. You can upgrade to 512GB SSD for $999 , down from $1,199, another all-time low price, or 24GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD for $1,199, down from $1,399. Then there's the 15-inch MacBook Air M4 , whose cheapest model is on sale for $999, dropping from $1,199. The 17 percent discount is the best deal we've seen since the pair debuted in March. As with the 13-inch model, the 16GB and 512GB SSD option is also a record-low price, dropping to $1,199 from $1,399. Then there's the 24GB upgrade , which is $1,399, down from $1,599. We're big fans of the MacBook Air M4, giving it a 92 in our review . Part of that comes from an already lower starting price for the MacBooks than their predecessors. The 2025 models also get a speed boost thanks to the M4 chip and are very thin with a 0.44-inch thickness. Neither the 13- or 15-inch will drag you down, weighing 2.7 pounds and 3.2 pounds, respectively. Plus, they both have excellent battery life, lasting over 18 hours while playing an HD video. The big differences in the 15-inch model mostly come down to size. The screen is obviously bigger, as is its trackpad. Other than that, it offers better speakers than its 13-inch sibling.

Trump has already signed an executive order to create the studio. According to Reuters , the president will appoint Airbnb co-founder Joe Gebbia as the head of the new organization, which one of its sources described as a stripped-down version of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). DOGE, which was once led by Elon Musk, aimed to cut wasteful government spending and modernize its IT systems. It facilitated mass layoffs of hundreds of thousands of federal workers and even dismantled whole agencies. As Reuters has noted, though, its activities have greatly slowed down after Musk left the organization and his role as Trump's advisor altogether. The White House did not respond to Reuters ' request for comment, and it's unclear if DOGE will continue operating once the studio has been formed. Gebbia will be apparently be named as the studio's the Chief Design Officer and will lead its efforts to upgrade the \"usability and aesthetics\" of federal digital services. The news organization says the studio will standardize design for websites meant to allow people to interact with the government and will advise agencies on how to reduce costs on duplicative designs. Based on Trump's executive order, the studio will shut down in three years before he steps down from office. While Gebbia will be the Chief Design Officer, an administrator will run the studio and will be in charge of reporting to White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles.

According to the PA news agency, when asked if Scottish Tory leader Russell Findlay is the right person for the job and whether he should stay in the post, he said: Clearly I’m no longer a member of the party so that’s no longer a decision for me to make. I get on very well as an individual with Russell, I think he’s a good individual. Whether he’s the person to lead the Scottish Conservatives is obviously for MSPs, for the membership, to decide. What I’m very clear about is that those with disabilities, other minorities and the people of Lothian need a voice for people to hear what we require within our country. I’m not sure any party is actually offering that at the moment but whether I stand or not I’ll come to a view in the next few weeks. It’s the party that’s moved, not me. We are disappointed to read these comments but grateful for Jeremy’s service and wish him well. The Scottish Conservatives, under Russell Findlay’s leadership, recognise that many people feel completely disconnected from politics. It is absolutely critical that our party continues to champion commonsense Conservative values and policies that focus on the issues of concern to hard-working Scots.

The highlight here is likely the Volt 12 indoor pizza oven , which has been slashed by 30 percent. That brings the price down to $629. The Volt 12 is an electric pizza oven that operates indoors, a first for the company. We praised the unit in our official review , saying that it \"works just as well\" as the company's indoor models. It preheats quickly and the interior is spacious. It can hit 850 degrees, which cooks a pizza in 90 seconds. The oven also requires little-to-no supervision during use. It's pretty much a set it and forget it type appliance. This operates in stark contrast with the company's outdoor models, which demands that folks pay attention to the fire during use. The Volt 12 made our list of the best pizza ovens , and it's absolutely the finest indoor model available right now. The only major downside is the price. It's tough to recommend any indoor kitchen doodad at $900, but it's easier to do so at $629. This isn't the only interesting item on sale right now at Ooni. The company's selling the Koda 2 Max outdoor pizza oven for $1,039 , which is a discount of $270. This extra-large gas-powered oven can handle multiple pizzas at once.

At this week’s Anime NYC convention, Netflix revealed a new teaser trailer for the upcoming Splinter Cell: Deathwatch and confirmed that the series will come to the service on October 14. Written by John Wick creator Derek Kolstad and starring Liev Schreiber as an older — but still decidedly badass — Sam Fisher, Splinter Cell: Deathwatch was first announced back in 2020, but we hadn’t learned much more until now. In the brief trailer, we see the National Security Agency’s most reliable stealth operative doing a fair bit of his trademark sneaking around in the shadows, after returning to the field for what he calls a \"personal\" mission. I also quite like how liberally the iconic Splinter Cell night vision goggles sound is used in the trailer. The voice cast also includes The Sandman ’s Kirby Howell-Baptise as Zinnia McKenna, an original character, and Janet Garvey as Anna Grimsdottir, a fellow agent who provided tech support to Fisher in the Splinter Cell games. The trailer itself doesn’t give much away about the plot, but we do see the grave of Douglas Shetland, a close friend of Fisher who he was ordered to eliminate in fan favorite game entry, Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory . Ubisoft is doing some interesting things in the adult animation space. The completely bonkers Captain Laserhawk: A Blood Dragon Remix reimagined Rayman as a foul-mouthed TV host and is littered with deep cut Ubisoft references. And somewhat inevitably, an animated Assassin’s Creed show is also currently in development, though we don’t have a date for that one yet.

What it didn’t announce is a Gemini-powered smart home speaker, but it might have snuck one into the presentation as an easter egg. As spotted by The Verge , about 15 minutes into the stream, on a table next to F1 driver Lando Norris during a Gemini demonstration, you can clearly see what looks a lot like a smart speaker. The fabric-wrapped device we see in the video is white with a light around its base, and it looks more like an upside down HomePod mini than any of Google's other speakers. According to Android Headlines , it’s called the Google Home Speaker, and is unsurprisingly powered by Gemini. Android Headlines claims to have seen more images of the as-yet unannounced smart speaker, which it says will also be available in red, light green and black. It adds that Google’s Gemini Live AI assistant will be a baked-in feature for voice conversations, though without a screen or camera there’s no visual element here. There could also be new natural voice options on the speaker, as well as standard features like media control and smart home automations. It can reportedly also detect unusual sounds like breaking glass or smoke alarms and can send an alert to your phone or tablet if this happens. According to the Android Headlines report, the Home Speaker can pair with a Google TV Streamer and double as an additional surround sound speaker, much like the HomePod does with Apple TV. It functions as a smart hub too, with support for Matter. Google announced Gemini for Home this week, which will gradually replace Google Assistant on the company’s existing smart devices, with free and paid tiers offered to users. What the leak doesn’t contain is a launch date for this mysterious speaker. But given that Google was seemingly happy enough to have one sitting there in its most important keynote of the year, the smart money would be on an official reveal pretty soon. Engadget reached out to Google for comment, but the company said it had nothing to share at this time.

That also means we'll finally get to officially lay eyes on the iPhone 17 lineup. The latest iOS 26 features will come preinstalled on the new models, as well as any additional features Apple reveals at the launch event. But since we (presumably) still have to wait a few weeks until the iPhone event, we can only speculate what the new devices will look like. As with most unreleased iPhones, rumors and leaks have trickled in about the hardware side ahead of the official introduction. Here's what we're expecting and what we can reasonably assume we'll get from Apple in September. What are the latest iPhone 17 rumors? Could new \"TechWoven\" cases be introduced with the latest iPhone 17 lineup? That's what leaker Majin Bu claims , per a MacRumors report . The cases match the rumored design on the iPhone 17 models, with the wide camera bump. MacRumors says this could be a revamped version of the much-maligned FineWoven case, which was discontinued due to being susceptible to scratches and stains. The leaker noted there are two lanyard holes for \"convenient and secure carrying,\" so it could be worn around your neck. More recently, the same leaker shared what they allege to be the case colors, in a post titled \"New TechWoven Case Colors for iPhone 17 Revealed.\" The colors shown in the image are grey/black, blue, green, purple and orange. New TechWoven Case Colors for iPhone 17 Revealed Full Article: https://t.co/nSA8Wbek5G pic.twitter.com/W6fZdb8psn — Majin Bu (@MajinBuOfficial) August 21, 2025 This is just a rumor and we won't know what the actual iPhone 17 models or accessories will look like until Apple's iPhone event next month. That said, the shared photos (including the one embedded above) are more convincing than usual. How much will the iPhone 17 cost? Apple's announced plan to expand US-based manufacturing partners seems to give it at least some shielding from the steepest Trump administration tariffs that have already triggered price increases on everything from Switch consoles to high-end cameras to Sonos speakers . But given that President Trump's trade policies can change from week to week, and Apple's continuing reliance on Asia-based supply chains, price shocks remain an ongoing possibility. The bigger question is: Will Apple absorb any higher costs, or pass them on to consumers? If prices do creep up, Apple may choose to pair it with an \"upgrade.\" Consider this recent rumor posted by MacRumors from a leaker known as \" Instant Digital ,\" suggesting that the default storage of the iPhone 17 line may start at 256GB, doubling the current 128GB baseline. While that could be accompanied by a price increase of $50 , Apple could at least pitch it as a \"better value.\" That said, the company doubled the default RAM of its Mac computers from 8GB to 16GB at no extra cost in 2024 — but that was before the current Trump tariff cycle started. When will the iPhone 17 series be announced? Most years, the flagship smartphones are introduced in September. MacRumors highlighted a story originally reported by iphone-ticker.de that the Apple iPhone 17 event could be Tuesday, September 9, according to information gleaned from German mobile phone providers. It's still too early to have the specific dates; some years, Apple only gives a week or two of lead time between sending invites and hosting the event. But years of past precedent show that sometime in September should be when the 17 models make their debut. This family of smartphones may be the last to follow that trend, however. There have been hints that the introduction of the iPhone 18 collection in 2026 will be split into a pro-tier announcement in the fall and a standard model announcement the following spring. What will the new iPhone 17 lineup include? Design leaks suggest that Apple is building an ultra-thin smartphone , likely to be named the iPhone 17 Air to match Apple's ultralight laptop designation. Bloomberg 's Mark Gurman, often a solid source of advanced intel about Apple, reported in January that the iPhone 17 Air will be equipped with a basic A19 chip and will only have a single camera lens. It may also use Apple's new in-house modem, which was introduced in February on the iPhone 16e . More details about this development may leak ahead of September, but that's what we know for now. An investor note from Apple analyst Jeff Pu indicated that the Air will have a titanium frame. If his reports are accurate, the lightweight smartphone will be the only entry in the iPhone 17 lineup to use that metal; the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max are expected to be made of aluminum, which is oddly a lighter material than titanium. Other speculation had suggested that the Air would use a blend of aluminum and titanium, so the exact materials may not be known until the official announcement. Additionally, an August 4 MacRumors report says the internal battery pack of the iPhone Air is just 2.49mm thick — half the thickness of the iPhone 17 Pro battery. The leak was posted on the Korean-language Naver blog , where they show the alleged batteries of the iPhone 17 Air and 17 Pro side by side. The same account claimed the 17 Air's battery capacity was a mere 2,800 mAh, MacRumors notes. (That's below the battery capacity of current iPhone 16 models.) On a similar topic, an iPhone 17 Pro production leak appears to have revealed an all-aluminum chassis, according to MacRumors . Originally posted by leaker Majin Bu , the image shows a shell that has a large round hole on the back (where the Apple logo typically is) to allow for MagSafe charging. MacRumors says this could just be a molding but notes that the aluminum frame (versus the current titanium in Pro iPhone models) would yield a significantly lower weight. That same leaker (Majin Bu), whom MacRumors classifies as a \"hit-or-miss leaker,\" suggests the iPhone 17 Pro will have better wireless signal strength thanks to an updated antenna design. The individual posted a render on X that shows a new antenna system that wraps around the iPhone 17 Pro's supposedly wider rear camera bump. Again, this is a render, not a real-world photo. That said, we can't knock the goal of better wireless reception, so we're hoping this one has a degree of truth to it. Each new roster includes a base model, but over the years, Apple has shaken up the variety of phones it offers. Most likely there will be an iPhone 17 and an iPhone 17 Pro. Apple has also committed to the size matters philosophy, and has been building an iPhone Pro Max option with an even bigger screen and better battery life; the 17 roster will almost certainly have one as well. The new Pro iPhones are said to have a full-width \"camera island\" on the rear, which would mark the first time an Apple model opted for that design. This feature can be seen in the purported iPhone 17 \"spotted in the wild.\" The pics, highlighted on MacRumors , show a black cased iPhone (17 Pro?) with the distinct back panel. Is it the real deal? The dual angles lend a degree of credibility in a social media landscape increasingly polluted with AI-enhanced fakes, but your guess is as good as ours. I just spotted a test development iPhone in the wild 🤩🤩🤩 pic.twitter.com/iS3PtKWqxJ — Fox Pupy 🦊🧡 (@Skyfops) July 28, 2025 The iPhone 17 Air seems primed to take the place of a potential iPhone 17 Plus. Since the iPhone 16e was only just introduced in February at a surprisingly high price point , it seems unlikely that there will be a new addition to that lower end of the spectrum, the models that were previously called SE. At the very least, it sounds like the iPhone 17 Air won't take away the charging port and rely only on wireless connectivity. Bloomberg said that while Apple had investigated making the iPhone 17 Air without a single port, the company (fortunately) changed plans. He also says that the rumored phone will have a 6.6-inch screen and include the Dynamic Island and Camera Control button. Finally, the price is rumored at $900 — likely more than the standard iPhone 17 but less than the Pro. We've also gotten what seems to be a reliable look at what the color lineup will be for the new smartphones. Macworld reported that the iPhone 17 will be available in black, white, steel gray, green, purple and light blue. The iPhone 17 Air will reportedly have four color options: black, white, light blue and light gold. While the Air colors will be less saturated, the visuals for the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max will go bold. The options for the Pro models are expected to be black, white, gray, dark blue and orange. On July 30, Tom's Guide highlighted an X post from Sonny Dickson — a longtime and generally reliable leaker of unreleased iPhone information — showing \"dummy\" iPhone 17 models in the new colors that were the source of the aforementioned Macworld story. While these are literally just mock-ups — not real, leaked iPhones — it's interesting to see how the design and color rumors translate into a real-world look and feel. To add the the rumors, a Weibo leaker known as Digital Chat Station suggests the iPhone 17e will come equipped with a new design that includes the Dynamic Island, MacRumors reports . According to the post, the new phone will have the A19 chip and could have a 6.1-inch OLED display with a front-facing 12-megapixel camera and a rear-facing 48-megapixel camera. However, it's important to note this report refers to the 17e model that would be expected to launch no earlier than February 2026, if it followed the same release pattern as the iPhone 16e . What will iOS 26 be like? Apple upended its numbering conventions with WWDC 2025, and will match the name of each new operating system to the year it's released. So when the next wave of iPhones hits, they'll be running on iOS 26 . On the design side, the smartphone OS introduced during the big developer showcase took a contentious approach dubbed Liquid Glass. Apple has been scaling down the amount of transparency effects in the subsequent beta tests of iOS 26, but it will still have a glass-like visual. The feature list includes big and small updates. On the more impactful side, the Phone and Photos apps have been redesigned. There will be several features leveraging artificial intelligence, such as live translation capabilities coming to Phone, FaceTime and Messages. Apple is also currently testing a sensitive content warning for child accounts that will freeze FaceTime video if nudity is detected by on-device machine learning tools. And the company is also launching Visual Intelligence, which will use AI to search for elements in an image. iOS 26 also has a litany of minor, quality of life improvements. Group texts are getting support for polls. And for the slow risers out there, iOS 26 will finally let you escape the tyranny of the nine minute snooze alarm . The next iOS is now available as a public beta . Here are our initial impressions of the Liquid Glass design and other new features. iOS 26 is compatible with all models back through iPhone 11. What other products are expected to be released alongside the iPhone 17? If Apple follows its usual pattern, the iPhone 17 will be announced alongside new Apple Watch products. That would be the Apple Watch Series 11 (if Apple sticks to the same naming scheme), and maybe an Apple Watch Ultra 3 and/or an updated Apple Watch SE. (They'll all run watchOS 26 , of course.) Other possibilities — and this is, again, speculation — could include refreshed Apple AirPods Pro (which received its last big update in 2022 ) and maybe new AirTags trackers (first released in 2021). The Apple rumor mill got a big shot in the arm this week thanks to the reported inclusion of product ID numbers in recent beta software builds. Per MacRumors , it's a laundry list of new hardware, including long-rumored product updates like the Apple TV , HomePod mini , new Apple Studio Display monitor and two fresh iPads. Of course, even if that list is totally accurate, we may not see those products until 2026 — if ever. So don't expect all of products to share the stage with the iPhone 17, especially since Apple likes to keep its star performer at the center of attention. That said, keep in mind that Apple has recently been having Mac-centric announcements in late October (as it did last year to debut new M4 Macs ), so there's always the chance of another shoe dropping a few weeks down the road.

With that should come the official date for downloading the latest software update, iOS 26 . While you wait, you can download and install the newly released public beta 4 (or iOS 26 developer beta 7 for developers). I've been playing around with it for the past couple of weeks, and have found that taking screenshots is way better in the new operating system — Google and ChatGPT search options are now in the screenshots editor, for instance. You can see a more complete view of the new features in our preview of the iOS 26 public beta release , which shows off the fresh home and lock screen redesign. Called Liquid Glass , the translucent look will extend across all of Apple's upcoming operating systems. The overhaul is one of several big changes coming to iOS, macOS , iPadOS and the rest of Apple's software suite, all of which were showcased during the company's WWDC keynote on June 9. After overpromising on AI plans last year, Apple kept its iOS roadmap focused more on basic quality of life improvements this year. There are multiple useful additions coming to the Phone and Messages apps on your iPhone, for instance: Apple execs outlined the ability to weed out spam texts or other unknown senders and an option to hold your spot on a phone call when you've been waiting for a representative to pick up. Plus, a treasured feature that we took for granted is coming back (hint: it's in the Photos app). Siri, meanwhile, is in a holding pattern. Apple has previously specified that its smarter voice assistant — first promised at WWDC 2024 — is delayed until some point \" in the coming year ,\" so you shouldn't expect any major changes in the current betas. But there are reports that Apple is aiming to give Siri a bigger brain transplant by basing it on third-party artificial intelligence models like OpenAI's ChatGPT or Anthropic's Claude, which could make 2026 a pivotal year. The company is also reportedly working on a 'stripped-down' AI chatbot to rival ChatGPT. With each beta, it seems like additional new improvements are popping up, like this new AirPods gesture we're all curious about, and this FaceTime feature that'll freeze your video if it detects nudity . With the release of the iOS 26 developer beta 5 , we saw more added features, like a new bouncy animation on the passcode screen and in the Control Center, MacRumors reports . Some or all of those changes will likely soon migrate into the separate public beta (see below). Most newer iPhone models are eligible to download iOS 26 (both the betas and final version). Want to see the full list of new features coming this fall? Read on. What is iOS 26? The current iPhone operating system is iOS 18, and Apple is still actively updating it — version 18.6.1 was released to restore Apple Watch blood oxygen monitoring functionality for certain users in the US. More recently, Apple released 18.6.2 to address a vulnerability related to image processing. Apple has officially stopped signing iOS 18.6, MacRumors reports , which means it can no longer be installed on your iPhone due to a \"server-side software verification check.\" That's pretty normal when newer versions are available to download. But don't expect to see iOS 19 soon — or ever. Instead, Apple is skipping the numbering ahead to iOS 26 later this year. The company has decided to line up its iOS version numbers with a year-based system, similar to car model years. So while iOS and its sibling operating systems will be released in late 2025, they're all designated \"26\" to reflect the year ahead. It's official, we're moving to iOS 26. (Apple) What is Liquid Glass design? Let's be honest. Out of everything announced at WWDC this year, the new Liquid Glass design was the star of the show. The iPhone's home and lock screens have looked pretty much the same year after year — the last exciting thing (in my opinion) was the option to add your own aesthetic to your home screen by customizing your apps and widgets. So seeing the home and lock screens' new facelift is refreshing. So what exactly is Liquid Glass? Apple calls it a \" new translucent material \" since, well, the apps and widgets are clear. However, the screen can still adapt to dark and light modes, depending on surroundings. You'll also notice buttons with a new floating design in several apps, like Phone and Maps. They're designed to be less distracting than the current buttons, but are still easy to see. While the design overhaul has proven to be controversial since its announcement, some — including Engadget's own Devindra Hardawar — like the new direction, even if it's somewhat reminiscent of Microsoft's translucent Windows Vista Aero designs from nearly twenty years ago. That said, as of the release of the iOS 26 beta 2, Apple has already incorporated some user feedback into the design, dialing back the transparency in at least some places. And while it will continue to evolve, Apple users won't be able to escape it: Liquid Glass was designed to make all of Apple's OSes more cohesive. Here's a look at how the translucent aesthetic will look with the new macOS Tahoe 26 on your desktop. What are the new and notable features of iOS 26? iOS 26 has a laundry list of new features. Among the most worthwhile: Phone app redesign: You'll finally be able to scroll through contacts, recent calls and voicemail messages all on one screen. It also comes with a new feature called Hold Assist that'll notify you when an agent comes to the phone so you can avoid the elevator music and continue on with other tasks. Live Translation in Phone, FaceTime and Messages: iOS 26 is bringing the ability to have a conversation via phone call or text message with someone who speaks another language. Live Translation will translate your conversation in real time, which results in some stop-and-go interactions in the examples Apple shared during its presentation. Polls in group chats: Tired of sorting through what seems like hundreds of messages in your group chat? You and your friends will soon be able to create polls in group messages for deciding things like which brunch spot you're eating at or whose car you're taking on a road trip. Filtering unknown senders in Messages: If you haven't received spam texts about unpaid tolls or other citations, you're lucky. For those of us who have, those annoying messages will soon be filtered away in a separate folder. Visual Intelligence: Similar to a reverse Google image search, this new feature will allow you to search for anything that's on your iPhone screen. For instance, if you spot a pair of shoes someone is wearing in an Instagram photo, you can screenshot it and use Visual Intelligence to find those shoes (or similar ones) online. Photos tabs are back: For anyone who's still frustrated with the Photos changes made last year , you'll be happy to know that your tabs are coming back. Library and Collections will have their own separate spaces so you don't have to scroll to infinity to find what you're looking for. FaceTime \"Communication Safety\" feature: A newer addition to iOS 26 appears to be the FaceTime \"Communication Safety\" feature that pauses communications if and when nudity is detected. The feature appears to be a child safety feature that uses on-device detection, thus obviating any cloud-based privacy issues. New lock screen options : The iPhone lock screen gets more customizable in iOS 26, with a cooler clock, 3D wallpaper effects, more widgets and better focus mode options. Apple's Hold Assist will be nifty for those pesky services that put you on hold for 10 or more minutes. (Apple) New changes coming to iPadOS 26 Your iPad isn't getting left behind when it comes to big updates. Here's what's coming this fall. Multitasking and real windowing: When you download the newest update, you'll be able to have multiple apps running on your screen at the same time. Once you open an app, it'll appear on your screen as normal but you'll be able to resize and move it across your screen to make room for other apps. This feature is optional so you can turn it off if you don't like it. Visual update: Along with the other new OSes, iPadOS 26 is coming with the Liquid Glass aesthetic. This new look will appear on the lock and home screens, as well as the drop-down menus. New menu bar: When you swipe down on your screen, the new menu bar will appear with options like File, Edit, Windows and more. There's also a search option if you're looking for something specific. Check out our first impressions of iPadOS 26 . What about AirPods? AirPods are also getting updated with iOS 26. Here are some of the more notable functions. Enhanced audio recording: Apple calls this \"studio-quality\" audio recording, and with it, you'll notice more clarity while in noisy environments. Camera remote control: Using this, you can take a photo or start and stop video recording with just one press on your AirPods. When taking photos, you'll get a three-second countdown before your iPhone or iPad snaps the picture. Live translation feature: While not officially announced or confirmed, it appears that the long-rumored live translation for AirPods could be coming with iOS 26 . The evidence comes from a system asset spotted in the in iOS 26 beta showing a gesture that's triggered by pressing both earbud stems at the same time. The photo also shows words in several different languages. Which iPhones will be able to upgrade to iOS 26? A few iPhone models that run the current version of iOS — iPhone XR, XS and XS Max — won't be compatible with the latest upgrade. But any iPhones released in 2019 or later will be eligible for the iOS 26 update . iPhone SE (second generation or later) iPhone 11 iPhone 11 Pro iPhone 11 Pro Max iPhone 12 iPhone 12 mini iPhone 12 Pro iPhone 12 Pro Max iPhone 13 iPhone 13 mini iPhone 13 Pro iPhone 13 Pro Max iPhone 14 iPhone 14 Plus iPhone 14 Pro iPhone 14 Pro Max iPhone 15 iPhone 15 Plus iPhone 15 Pro iPhone 15 Pro Max iPhone 16 iPhone 16 Plus iPhone 16 Pro iPhone 16 Pro Max iPhone 16e Not listed here are the presumed new iPhone 17 models (or maybe iPhone 26?) that are all but certain to be announced and released in September. How to install iOS 26 beta The iOS 26 public beta is now available to download via the Apple Beta Software Program . If you're not already a member, you'll need to sign up to try out all the latest features. Just visit beta.apple.com and sign up with your phone number or email address. It's free. Once you're in, you can install it by going to Settings > General > Software Update and selecting iOS 26 public beta . A word of caution: Don't sign up with your main iPhone unless you're OK with any risks that occur with using an OS that isn't finalized. When will the final version of iOS 26 be released? iOS 26 will be released to the public this fall. It usually comes in September, within a week of the Apple iPhone event. Last year, it rolled out to iPhone users on September 16 — exactly one week after the iPhone 16 lineup was announced.

What it didn’t announce is a Gemini-powered smart home speaker, but it might have snuck one into the presentation as an easter egg. As spotted by The Verge , about 15 minutes into the stream, on a table next to F1 driver Lando Norris during a Gemini demonstration, you can clearly see what looks a lot like a smart speaker. The fabric-wrapped device we see in the video is white with a light around its base, and it looks more like an upside down HomePod mini than any of Google's other speakers. According to Android Headlines , it’s called the Google Home Speaker, and is unsurprisingly powered by Gemini. Android Headlines claims to have seen more images of the as-yet unannounced smart speaker, which it says will also be available in red, light green and black. It adds that Google’s Gemini Live AI assistant will be a baked-in feature for voice conversations, though without a screen or camera there’s no visual element here. There could also be new natural voice options on the speaker, as well as standard features like media control and smart home automations. It can reportedly also detect unusual sounds like breaking glass or smoke alarms and can send an alert to your phone or tablet if this happens. According to the Android Headlines report, the Home Speaker can pair with a Google TV Streamer and double as an additional surround sound speaker, much like the HomePod does with Apple TV. It functions as a smart hub too, with support for Matter. Google announced Gemini for Home this week, which will gradually replace Google Assistant on the company’s existing smart devices, with free and paid tiers offered to users. What the leak doesn’t contain is a launch date for this mysterious speaker. But given that Google was seemingly happy enough to have one sitting there in its most important keynote of the year, the smart money would be on an official reveal pretty soon.

Ubisoft said Survivors is in its early stages, which may explain the lack of detail. Other media outlets have reported that it will come in 2026. But the company's franchise roadmap places its release date under \"TBA.\" \" The Division 2: Survivors is as much your baby as it is ours, and we strive for transparency during its development,\" Executive Producer Julian Gerighty wrote in the announcement blog post. \"Clear communication and community involvement are a focus as we build the new experience, and we will be closely involving you as we move forward on the development journey.\" Ubisoft Ubisoft also confirmed that its free-to-play mobile game is still in the pipeline. The Division Resurgence is expected this year. The company announced a delay last summer. A Redditor who played a beta version in 2023 described it in less than appealing terms. \"Overall, Resurgence is a console clone of The Division , where you can team up and play with clunky, small mobile controls.\" To be fair, much could have changed in its development since then. Regardless, you can sign up for the closed beta on Ubisoft's website .

Less than an hour ago, a post from Bolton’s X account critiqued the state of negotiations between Russia and Ukraine. “Russia has not changed its goal: drag Ukraine into a new Russian Empire,” he wrote. “Meanwhile, meetings will continue because Trump wants a Nobel Peace Prize, but I don’t see these talks making any progress.” Continue reading...", "ingested_utc": "2025-08-22T18:49:42Z"}

The companies are in the early stages of exploring a partnership, with Google training a version of its Gemini model that can run on Apple's servers. The iPhone maker was previously reported to be considering similar partnerships with OpenAI and Anthropic . \"The company is simultaneously developing two versions of the new Siri: one dubbed Linwood that is powered by its models and another code-named Glenwood that runs on outside technology, \" Bloomberg writes. A final decision has yet to be made on what AI model Apple will ultimately use, but it's entirely possible it sticks with its internally-developed models. While seceding a potentially key technology to a competitor seems decidedly un-Apple, it's a testament to how much difficulty the company has had rolling out Apple Intelligence. Apple included the majority of its new AI features in the release of iOS 18 , but failed to ship an updated version of Siri that can draw on personal data to take action in apps. Apple ultimately admitted the Siri update was delayed in March, with the new launch now expected sometime in 2026 . The turmoil caused by the delay reportedly led to Apple's various AI projects changing hands internally , and the company's decision to consider using a third-party AI model. As of the launch of the Pixel 10 , Gemini now offers a similar set of capabilities to what Apple promised with the new Siri. It could presumably do the same things on iOS with the right changes. Using a version of Gemini that runs on Apple's hardware and servers — the company calls this Private Cloud Compute — could also add an additional layer of security. Apple was reportedly planning to offer Gemini as an alternative to ChatGPT in Apple Intelligence, but the option has yet to ship. Having Gemini power some of its AI features would put Apple in a similar position to Samsung, who's Galaxy AI relies on a mix of custom models and Gemini.
