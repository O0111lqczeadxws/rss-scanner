The best noise-canceling headphones block out distractions and let you enjoy your music, podcasts or calls in peace — all while delivering great sound quality and all-day comfort. From models with plush cushions to wireless cans with loads of extra features, there’s something here for every style and budget. Table of contents Best noise-canceling headphones for 2025 How to choose the best noise-canceling headphones for you How we test noise-canceling headphones Other noise-canceling headphones we tested Noise-canceling headphones FAQs Best noise-canceling headphones of 2025 How to choose the best noise-canceling headphones for you Design When you’re shopping for the best wireless headphones, the first thing you’ll need to decide on is wear style. Do you prefer on-ear or over-ear headphones? For the purposes of this guide, I focus on the over-ear style as that’s what most noise-canceling headphones are nowadays. Sure, you can find on-ear models with ANC, but over-ear, active noise-canceling headphones are much more effective at blocking outside sounds since your ears are completely covered. For gamers, there are also gaming headsets that feature noise cancellation — some even have detachable microphones, so they can double as over-ear headphones. However, for the purpose of this article, we’re only going to be focusing on noise-canceling headphones rather than headsets. Look for models with a comfortable headband and memory foam ear cups to ensure you can wear them for long periods without discomfort. Many headphones also come with a range of color options, so if aesthetics matter to you, you’ll find plenty of choices beyond just black or white. Whether you’re looking for something neutral or a bold pop of color, brands now offer a variety of styles to match your personal taste. Finally, if you’re planning to wear your headphones for long periods of time, it’s important to pick a model with a comfortable fit. Memory foam ear cups, an adjustable headband, and lightweight materials can make all the difference during extended listening sessions. After all, great sound is only part of the equation; comfort matters just as much. Type of noise cancellation Next, you’ll want to look at the type of ANC a set of headphones offers. You’ll come across terms like “hybrid active noise cancellation” or “hybrid adaptive active noise cancellation,” and there are key differences between the two. A hybrid ANC setup uses microphones on the inside and on the outside of the device to detect outside noise and cancel it out. By analyzing input from both mics, a hybrid system can combat more sounds than “regular” ANC, but it does so at a constant level that doesn’t change. Adaptive ANC takes the hybrid configuration a step further by continuously adjusting the noise cancellation for changes in your environment and any leakage around the padding of the ear cups. Adaptive noise-canceling also does a better job with wind noise, which can really kill your vibe while using headphones outdoors. Some high-end headphones also support Dolby Atmos, which enhances spatial audio and makes everything from music to movies sound more immersive. For the purposes of this best headphones list, I’m only considering products with hybrid ANC or adaptive ANC setups because those are the most effective at blocking noise and improving your overall listening experience. Customization You’ll also want to check to see if the ANC system on a prospective set of headphones offers adjustable levels of noise cancellation or presets. These can help you dial in the amount of ANC you need for various environments, but it can also help you save battery life. Master & Dynamic, for example, has ANC presets that provide both maximum noise blocking and more efficient cancellation that is more energy efficient. Other companies may include a slider in their companion apps that let you adjust the ANC level to your liking. Some high-end models even allow you to fine-tune the ANC for specific types of environments. How we test noise-canceling headphones The primary way we test headphones is to wear them as much as possible. I prefer to do this over a one-to-two-week period, but sometimes deadlines don’t allow it. During this time, I listen to a mix of music and podcasts , while also using the headphones to take both voice and video calls. Since battery life for headphones can be 30 hours or more, I drain the battery with looping music and the volume set at a comfortable level (usually around 75 percent). Due to the longer battery estimates, I’ll typically power the headphones off several times and leave them that way during a review. This simulates real-world use and keeps me from having to constantly monitor the process for over 24 straight hours. To test ANC performance specifically, I use headphones in a variety of environments, from noisy coffee shops to quiet home offices. When my schedule allows, I use them during air travel since plane noise is a massive distraction to both work and relaxation. Even if I can’t hop on a flight, I’ll simulate a constant roar with white noise machines, bathroom fans, vacuums and more. I also make note of how well each device blocks human voices, which are a key stumbling block for a lot of ANC headphones. ANC-related features are something else to consider. Here, I do a thorough review of companion apps, testing each feature as I work through the software. Any holdovers from previous models are double checked for improvements or regression. If the headphones I’m testing are an updated version of a previous model, I’ll spend time getting reacquainted with the older set. Ditto for the closest competition for each new set of headphones that I review. Other noise-canceling headphones we tested AirPods Max Apple’s AirPods Max are premium, well-designed over-ear headphones that incorporate all of the best features you find on standard AirPods: solid noise cancellation, spatial audio and easy Siri access. However, their $550 starting price makes them almost prohibitively expensive, even for Apple users. There are better options available at lower prices, but if you can pick up the AirPods Max at a steep discount, they might be worthwhile for the biggest Apple fans among us. Dyson On-Trac The On-Trac headphones have an almost infinitely customizable design, and that’s what’s most unique about them. The sound profile offers some nice detail, but lacks dynamic range overall. ANC is average at best and there aren’t any advanced features that will make your life easier. Well, except for the hearing health monitor, which is actually handy. All told, that’s not a lot for a set of $500 headphones. Sonos Ace The Sonos Ace is an excellent debut for the company’s first headphones. The combination of refined design, great sound quality and home theater tricks creates a unique formula. However, ANC performance is just okay and key functionality is still in the works for many users. Sony ULT Wear If most headphones don’t have the level of bass you desire, the ULT Wear is an option to consider. The low-end thump isn’t for everyone, but there are also plenty of handy features and a refined look to make the $200 set more compelling than many in this price range. Beats Studio Pro The Studio Pro lacks basic features like automatic pausing, and multipoint connectivity is only available on Android. Moreover, they’re not very comfortable for people with larger heads. Overall sound quality is improved, though, and voice performance on calls is well above average. Master & Dynamic MH40 (2nd gen) The MH40 are a great set of headphones if you favor crisp, clear and natural sound that isn’t overly tuned. This pair showcases the company’s affinity for leather and metal too, but limited customization and short battery life for non-ANC cans kept this set from making the cut. Bowers & Wilkins Px8 The company’s trademark pristine sound is on display here, but the Px8 is more expensive and not nearly as comfortable as the Px7 S3. Noble Audio FoKus Apollo While this is my top pick for overall sound quality in our main guide to the best wireless headphones , the ANC performance is less impressive than the Px7 S3. Bowers & Wilkins gets the nod here for its improved noise cancellation over the Px7 S2 and Px7 S2e, and its overall excellent audio quality. Noise-canceling headphones FAQs Does noise cancellation block all noise? Noise cancellation doesn’t block out all noise, though it does drastically reduce the volume of most external sounds. Is there a difference between wired vs wireless noise-canceling headphones? In terms of sound quality, if you have two headphones — one wired and one wireless — with similar specs, the difference is going to be very minimal. However, wireless headphones offer more convenience, allowing you to move around more freely with your headphones on, which is why they often feature noise cancellation to minimize external sounds. Does noise cancellation impact sound quality? ANC does bear some weight on sound quality, but the impact of this often doesn’t outweigh the benefits. Noise cancellation reduces ambient noise, allowing a greater focus on audio detail. For audiophiles, however, there may be a small difference in sound fidelity when ANC is turned on.

There is now a race against time to stop this famine from becoming any further entrenched. Every hour counts and there is no time to waste. The international community must take meaningful action and use diplomatic pressure to bring about a permanent ceasefire immediately. The Famine Review Committee (FRC) has determined that Famine (IPC Phase 5) is now occurring in Gaza Governorate. Furthermore, the FRC projects Famine (IPC Phase 5) thresholds to be crossed in Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis Governorates in the coming weeks. As this Famine is entirely human-made, it can be halted and reversed. The time for debate and hesitation has passed, starvation is present and is rapidly spreading. There should be no doubt in anyone’s mind that an immediate, at-scale response is needed. Any further delay-even by days-will result in a totally unacceptable escalation of Famine-related mortality. • If a ceasefire is not implemented to allow humanitarian aid to reach everyone in the Gaza Strip, and if essential food supplies, and basic health, nutrition, and WASH services are not restored immediately, avoidable deaths will increase exponentially.

This release introduces several new features and optimizations, including the default enabling of receipt persistence, a smarter snapshots downloader, and numerous consensus layer improvements and official support for Shutter Network on Gnosis Chain. Breaking changes Port of external RPCDaemon now uses the same WebSocket port as the default for Erigon. ( #15643 ) Docker Images: Docker images are now based on Debian. ( #16228 ) Go Language Version: The required Go version is now golang 1.24. Receipt Persistence: The --persist.receipts flag is now enabled by default (more details are provided below). Pebble Paws will be the last Erigon release series to officially support Polygon. How to upgrade Erigon 3.1 Pebble Paws will work flawlessly with old data. For those who want to ensure they have the absolute latest data files and any recent data-specific fixes, you can optionally perform a manual data upgrade. After upgrading your Erigon binary and having done a back-up of your data directory, just run the command erigon snapshots reset --datadir /your/datadir . Key features Disk Footprint and Management Several improvements furtherly reduced the size of the Ethereum archive nodes while actually storing more data, making the nodes more cost-effective and easier to manage: The --persist.receipts flag is now enabled by default for Full and Minimal nodes. This downloads pre-calculated receipts, ensuring a consistent and predictable latency, meaning a more reliable system when interacting with the network, especially during high-traffic periods, and a 10x faster RPC for calls like eth_getLogs . The size of the receipts is 300 GB for the Ethereum mainnet, 1 TB for the Polygon bor-mainnet, and 200 GB for the Gnosis Network. However, this can be disabled with the command --persist.receipts=false . In this case, the RPC calls will generate receipts on demand from the StateHistory. ( #16040 ). The size of .ef files was reduced by 50% with better encoding, resulting in smaller archive nodes. ( #12907 ) Rolled out phase 1 of history expiry, allowing nodes to drop pre-merge data, which significantly reduces storage requirements and simplifies node maintenance. ( #15668 ) Efficiently upgrade the existing data using the new snapshots update and snapshots reset commands , reducing node downtime and resource usage while avoiding a full re-sync. Several optimization have been implemented to reduce latency, lower disk I/O, and optimize VM and snapshot operations, resulting in faster, more efficient node operation and easier maintenance ( #14135 , #14902 , #15115 , #15092 , #16140 ). Networking and Performance Faster and more reliable syncing: the new Bittorrent web seed implementation downloads entire files in a single stream instead of making many small-range HTTP requests, resulting in faster syncing, reduced server load, improved CDN compatibility, and enhanced protection against DDoS attacks. The downloader now automatically switches sources if the snapshot set becomes inaccessible, and once the snapshot files are downloaded, they are marked as read-only to prevent accidental corruption. Torrent logging and status outputs have been upgraded, offering clearer real-time insights into sync speed, estimated completion times, and the root causes of any synchronization stalls. ( #15043 ) A new configuration flag now enables independent tuning of web seeding and peer-to-peer (P2P) download speeds, delivering more control over how data is sourced and transferred. ( #15912 ) Improved and more reliable experience with faster, more accurate RPC responses, improved error handling, and broader support for new features and tools. ( #13795 , #13947 , #14075 , #14093 , #14105 , #14152 , #14803 , #14915 , #14994 , #15948 , #16029 , #16101 ) Smoother Polygon Network experiences with faster syncing, improved reliability, and better compatibility, thanks to a series of targeted bug fixes and optimizations. ( #14056 , #14080 , #13845 , #13807 , #15595 , #16160 , #16035 , #15538 ) The new probabilistic filter makes historical queries much faster and more efficient. ( #15960 ) Protocol Improved Caplin (Consensus Layer) reliability and performance with enhanced slot processing, better peer management, optimized block and attestation handling, new validator deposit toolingAore efficient reorg support. These updates provide smoother network participation, easier validator operations, and improved responsiveness.

It also implements various Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) related to blobs and gas, ensuring compatibility with upcoming network changes. ( #13975 , #15420 ) Added support for the latest protocol upgrades and features—delivering improved compatibility, security, and performance for users. ( #14705 , #14702 , #14672 , #15093 , #15148 , #15450 , #15067 , #15399 , #15519 , #15532 , #15609 , #15688 , #14213 ) Shutter Network Official support for Shutter Network has been added to Erigon Validators on Gnosis Chain, helping prevent malicious Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) attacks by enabling the use of encrypted transactions. ( #13725 , #13864 , #13865 , #13983 , #14187 , #16505 , #16554 , #16561 , #16592 , #16590 ) Further information can be found at https://github.com/erigontech/erigon/tree/release/3.1/txnprovider/shutter#shutter QA and Testing Improvemend testing and QA to deliver more reliable releases and higher quality software by expanding automated testing, enforcing stricter failure checks, and enhancing test coverage for every commit.

But the base-model Kindle is also good, offering a cheap and easy entry point into ebooks. And Boox makes a few E Ink readers that do more than just display books. Now that most ereader companies also offer color models, the field is wider than ever. In short, there are a few things to consider before buying your next (or first) ereader and this guide covers product recommendations alongside advice on how to get the most out of your new device. Table of contents Best ereaders What to look for in an ereader How to get books for your ereader How we test ereaders Ereader FAQs Recent updates The best ebook readers for 2025 What to look for in an ereader Plenty of apps, including the Kindle app, will let you download and read digital books on an iPhone, Android Phone or tablet. But what makes ebook readers different is the screen: nearly all of them use technology from a company called E Ink. It manufactures electronic paper displays (EPD) composed of three sheets: one containing millions of microcapsules filled with black and white ink particles sandwiched between transparent electrode layers. When a charge is applied, either the black or white particles shift to the top, forming letters and the whitespace around them. Color ereaders add a color filter array on top of the standard black and white microcapsule layer. The result is two different resolutions on one screen — the color clarity is 150 dpi while black and white images and text are still 300 dpi. Because these displays are so different from standard backlight LED panels, you can expect most good ereaders to do a number of things well. They’ll be easier to stare at for long periods of time and easier to read in direct sunlight. Also, since E Ink displays only require power to rearrange the ink, these devices have much longer battery lives than even the best tablets: we’re talking weeks on a single charge, not days. The ereader market is not as saturated as, say, the smartphone market, but there are still plenty of options out there and they do have small but important differences among them. They tend to range from around $100 to more than $400, though usually the higher end options are stylus-enabled read/write E Ink tablets like the Kindle Scribe. Beyond price, you should consider physical properties like buttons, lights, storage and resolution, as well as how the software lets you find and access books. Reading features With any ereader, you’ll navigate the OS via taps and swipes, and some add physical page-turn buttons. Most with built-in buttons have an auto-rotating screen so you can press with your right or left hand. As E Ink technology has advanced, resolution has greatly improved – even the budget Kindle ereader has a 300 ppi display. You can still find models with lower resolution, but we don’t recommend them. Some ereaders have front LEDs that support light temperature adjustment. That means you can switch to a warmer light after the sun goes down, which will feel easier on the eyes. If you’re concerned about blue light, you should go for a reader with that feature. Finally, dark mode is available on most later model ereaders, allowing you to invert the black and white text and background, which some people find easier to read in low-light settings. Other features The capabilities of these pocket libraries have advanced considerably since the early days. In addition to storing books, some let you browse the web, run apps and play music. The screen’s frame rate can’t handle gaming, but it’s good enough to show you the Wikipedia entry for Striver’s Row while you read Crook Manifesto . If you listen to audiobooks, you may want a Bluetooth-enabled ereader capable of playing them. Most of the models we tested have that ability, with the notable exception of the Nook ereader we tried. Keep in mind that audiobook files can take up more space than print files so you'll probably want a device with a higher storage capacity if you plan on doing a lot of listening. Above all, you should consider where and how you intend to find books to read. Most ereaders make it easiest to shop through their own digital bookstores, but all of them (even Kindles ) will now let you download titles from other sources, like libraries, unaffiliated ebook sellers and free public domain sites. Photo by Amy Skorheim / Engadget How to get books for your ereader Kindle, Nook and Kobo all have their own stores that you access directly from each brand’s devices. Prices are the same among all sellers, too. Publishers set the price of an ebook, not the retailer, so a title will cost the same at Amazon, Barnes & Noble, eBooks.com and the Kobo store. Amazon offers Kindle Unlimited for $12 per month, and it includes four million titles from which you can pick your next read. It includes audio and ebooks, but you won’t find many big, new releases or older bestsellers. Kobo has a subscription called Kobo Plus with about 1.3 million titles: it goes for $8 per month for ebooks only, $8 for audiobooks only or $10 for both. Buying a book from a proprietary store instantly delivers it to your device, provided you’re connected to WiFi. It also syncs your reading across devices and apps, so you can pick up where you left off on your phone if you forgot your ereader at home. It truly is the most convenient way to go, but if you don’t want to be locked into one brand’s store, or if you opt for an ereader without its own marketplace, you do have options. How to upload ePubs onto an ereader Stores like ebooks.com and Google Play have millions of ebooks for sale as digital rights-managed (DRM) ePub files, which Kobo, Nook and PocketBook readers can read in their native ereader apps. Kindles don’t support DRM ePub files at all and Boox devices require third party reading apps (of which there are many) to read those files. Titles from Apple Books are only readable in iOS devices. Titles from some publishers like Tor and public domain classics from sites like Project Gutenberg are also sold as ePubs, but without the added DRM. Consequently, Kindles and the Boox Neoreader do support those files. Books you get from third-party sources will look just like ones you bought from a proprietary store, thanks to the flowable, formatted nature of ePub files. While these device-agnostic ebook collections give you extra options for finding your next read, they require a few additional steps to get the files onto your ereader. To do so, you’ll typically need a computer running a free program called Adobe Digital Editions (ADE). After buying and downloading the ePub file, open ADE and plug your ereader into your computer (all readers here have a USB-C port for charging and data transfers). Your device should pop up in the left panel. Drag and drop the ePub file from your downloads folder into the main panel in ADE. The file will display as an image of the book cover. Drag that image onto your device on the left panel. If the file includes digital rights management (which protects against unauthorized copying) you’ll need to authorize your ereader, which requires using or creating a free Adobe ID . Once you’ve finished adding files to upload, eject the reader from your computer to complete the transfer process. Kindles use a web-based uploader instead of the ADE method. But since Kindle uses its own proprietary DRM technology instead of Adobe's, the only files it can accept from third parties are non-DRM files, such as from Tor Publishing or Project Gutenberg. After downloading a compatible ePub file, drag and drop it into your browser with the Send to Kindle page open. As long as you’re signed into Amazon, this wirelessly transfers the files to your associated device. Boox also uses a browser uploader called BooxDrop (along with many other methods ) to deliver ePubs to the device. Open it from the Boox App menu and you’ll see a device-specific url. Type that into your browser to access a file delivery portal that uploads to your library. Boox’s built-in ereader app, NeoReader, also doesn’t support files with DRM, so you won’t be able to read current titles from most publishers using that app. Fortunately, Boox devices run nearly every ereader app out there, Kobo and Kindle included, letting you access ePubs any number of ways. Recently, Bookshop.org, the online seller of physical books that supports indie bookstores, started selling ebooks and up to 100 percent of the profits will go to local booksellers. The company uses a different rights management system than ADE so, right now, you can only read titles you buy from them on the Bookshop.org app , but the company is working with the makers of both Kindle and Kobo to extend compatibility to those ereaders. How to read library books on an ereader Your local library card lets you borrow audio and ebooks through a program called Overdrive and its companion app Libby . On a Kobo , you have have built-in access to Overdrive in a separate tab. Once you’ve linked your public library card, the search function will include results for titles available from your local library system; a few taps will upload your selections to your device for the length of the loan. I personally find it easiest to borrow the title I want through the Libby app on my phone. After that, the book pops up on my Kobo’s home screen once the device syncs. To read library books on a Kindle , you can either go through the Libby app or the Overdrive section of your library’s website. Once you click Borrow, you’ll see the option to “Read now with Kindle,” which takes you to Amazon’s site to sign in. After that, the book will be delivered to your device the next time it connects to WiFi. For other ereaders, you’ll go through your library’s Overdrive portal and download the ePub after clicking the Borrow button. You can then use the ADE process we described above. Devices that run external apps, like Boox's Page, Go Color 7 or Palma, allow you to read library books via the Libby app, just as you would on a smartphone or iPad. You can also use the Libby app to borrow audiobooks, but you won’t be able to access them through your ereader. (The exception is an ereader, like a Boox device, that allows external apps). I found it was easier to listen to an audiobook on my phone anyway, regardless of whether I borrowed it through Libby or bought it from Kindle or Kobo. Photo by Amy Skorheim / Engadget How we test ereaders When putting together any guide, the first thing we do is spend hours researching the field. We look at what’s available, what’s new, and what shoppers and professional reviewers have to say. Then we narrow a list to the best candidates for hands-on testing. Over the course of the past two years, I’ve tested just over a dozen ereaders, representing five different brands: Amazon, Kobo, Barnes & Noble, Boox and PocketBook. I bought, borrowed and uploaded books for each device using the methods above. I used each one for between a few days to a few months. I evaluated each one in the areas of book access, ease of reading, extra features and overall value. Here’s everything we tested so far: Amazon Kindle (2022) Amazon Kindle (2024) Amazon Kindle Paperwhite (2021) Amazon Kindle Paperwhite Signature (2024) Boox Go Color 7 Boox Leaf 2 Boox Page Boox Poke 5 Boox Palma Kobo Libra 2 Kobo Libra Colour Kobo Clara 2E Kobo Clara Colour Kobo Nia NOOK GlowLight 4 PocketBook Era Other ereaders we tested Amazon Kindle Colorsoft Amazon’s first color Kindle impressed with its quick page-turns and load times, auto-adjusting front light and, of course, a decently striking color E Ink display. But at $280, it’s more expensive than all of the other color ereaders in its size range, including the Kobo Libra Colour and the Boox Go Color 7. Also, some Colorsoft owners reported seeing a yellow band at the bottom of their ereader’s display. This issue did not affect our first review unit during the original testing period, but it eventually appeared. An Amazon spokesperson told Engadget: \"A small number of customers have reported a yellow band along the bottom of the display. We take the quality of our products seriously—customers who notice this can reach out to our customer service team for a replacement or refund, and we’re making the appropriate adjustments to ensure that new devices will not experience this issue moving forward.\" Amazon sent us a new Colorsoft ereader at the end of 2024 and it does appear that the fixes the company made resolved the yellow-band issue. The screen on our second review unit appears warmer overall, but not overly so. It’s more akin to the screen on the Kobo Libra Colour, and that’s a good thing. Boox Go 7 stylus-enabled ereader Boox recently released two new stylus-enabled generations of their seven-inch reader: The monochrome Go 7 and a color-screen Go Color 7 (Gen II) . After trying out the stylus-enabled Go 7, I still like the standard, non-stylus enabled version better. True, I liked the Notebook app with its array of handwriting templates and I appreciated the low-to-no latency with the stylus. It also offers a good assortment of brush, pen and style options. But outside of the Notebook app, I didn’t find much use for the stylus. I was able to doodle in the margins of DRM-free books in Boox’s native NeoReader, but it doesn’t work in other apps or on any rights-managed books. There's a FreeMark option that allows you to draw or write atop any app, but it saves your doodles as separate images, as opposed to allowing you to mark up the page itself. I also found enabling the stylus to be a little glitchy. If you plan to do a lot of writing, you’ll probably be better served by an E Ink tablet , but if you want an ereader that can mark up your books, I suggest going with the Kobo Libra Color, detailed above. Ereader FAQs What's the difference between an ereader and an e-ink reader? Really, they are the same thing. E Ink is a company that designs and manufactures the paper-like screens found in most ereader devices. Technically, anything you read ebooks on can act as an ereader, so your phone, iPad or Android tablet could all serve that purpose, but they’re not considered dedicated ereaders. While there are some devices marketed as ereaders that have LCD or OLED screens instead of E Ink, they aren’t as common. One of the benefits of ereaders is the E Ink screen’s paper-like quality, which causes less eye strain for many people. But there is a difference between ereaders and E Ink tablets . These larger e-ink devices also employ E Ink screens, but they have stylus input and are often used for note taking and other tasks in addition to reading ebooks. We have an entire guide devoted to helping you pick out an E Ink tablet . Are there ads on my ereader? The base model Kindle and Kindle Paperwhite come with ads by default, but you can opt to pay $20 to remove them, either at the time of purchase or after you start using the device. The ads are limited to the lockscreen and are typically for other books or Kindle services. Kobo and Boox ereaders don’t come with ads. Which ereader has the longest battery life? Of the devices we tested, the Boox Go Color 7 has the largest listed battery capacity at 2,300mAh (Amazon doesn’t list the capacity of its Kindle devices). But thanks to the nature of E Ink screens and the relatively limited processing power required to display e-books, nearly all ereaders can go for weeks before they need a recharge. That means battery life probably isn’t as much of a deciding factor in buying an ereader as it would be with a tablet or smartphone. Which ereaders can read Kindle books? Amazon’s Kindle ereaders are the obvious answer, but other devices capable of running apps can also read titles from the Kindle store. For example, you can download the Kindle app on a Boox ereader through Google Play (the store comes standard in the Boox app menu). You can then sign into your Kindle account and access all the books in your library — the same way you’d read Kindle books on your phone or tablet. Can you buy Kindle books without a Kindle? Yes. You can buy Kindle books through the Kindle app or through Amazon’s website via a browser. You can read those titles on a Kindle or any device that can run the Kindle app, such as a smartphone, tablet or computer. Just be aware that Kindle titles can only be read through one of Amazon’s ereaders or the Kindle app. The company uses proprietary digital rights management on all ebooks it sells that can’t be read by other ereader apps like Kobo or Adobe ADE. What's the difference between Kindle and Kobo? Both Kindle and Kobo are brands of dedicated ereaders that support searching, buying, downloading and reading ebooks from their own stores. Both also support borrowing books from your local library via Overdrive and Libby. The difference is that Kindle is owned by Amazon and uses the Kindle store, whereas Kobo is owned by Rakuten and its books come from the Kobo store. Both stores come pre-loaded as a tab on their respective ereader and both carry most in-print books. Each store also carries their own exclusive ebooks as well, but Amazon’s library of Kindle-only books is much larger than Kobo’s . Amazon also offers Amazon Original stories to read on the Kindle, which are free short fiction and nonfiction reads that are free to Prime members. Which ereader is best for library books? Both Kobos and Kindles have simple systems for borrowing library books. Other ereaders, like Boox, let you borrow books after downloading the Libby App. Only Kobo ereaders let you search for and borrow books directly on the ereader, with a dedicated Overdrive tab. Kindles, on the other hand, utilize a convenient “read on Kindle” function from the Libby app or website. You can send a borrowed book to your Kindle just by signing into your account. Both methods are pretty easy, so which is the best for you probably depends on other factors than just the library-book feature.

According to the PA news agency, when asked if Scottish Tory leader Russell Findlay is the right person for the job and whether he should stay in the post, he said: Clearly I’m no longer a member of the party so that’s no longer a decision for me to make. I get on very well as an individual with Russell, I think he’s a good individual. Whether he’s the person to lead the Scottish Conservatives is obviously for MSPs, for the membership, to decide. What I’m very clear about is that those with disabilities, other minorities and the people of Lothian need a voice for people to hear what we require within our country. I’m not sure any party is actually offering that at the moment but whether I stand or not I’ll come to a view in the next few weeks. It’s the party that’s moved, not me. We are disappointed to read these comments but grateful for Jeremy’s service and wish him well. The Scottish Conservatives, under Russell Findlay’s leadership, recognise that many people feel completely disconnected from politics. It is absolutely critical that our party continues to champion commonsense Conservative values and policies that focus on the issues of concern to hard-working Scots.

According to The Information , the company told Arizona-based Amkor Technology and Samsung Electronics to put a pause on their work for the H20. Amkor produces advanced packaging for the H20 chips, while Samsung supplies memory for NVIDIA. Reuters has also reported that NVIDIA asked Foxconn, which is in charge of backend processing for the chip, to suspend its work. \"We constantly manage our supply chain to address market condition,\" the company told CNBC in a statement when asked to comment about the supposed production pause. The US government had blocked NVIDIA from selling the H20 in China back in April, out of concerns that the country could use it to develop AI tech for its military. It allowed the company to resume selling the chip in China by July, reportedly after closing a deal that would give it 15 percent of the sales. But China didn't welcome the H20 with open arms. Local regulators instructed the biggest Chinese tech companies, including ByteDance and Alibaba to stop new orders for H20 chips, citing security concerns. The Cyberspace Administration of China talked to NVIDIA, claiming that AI experts had revealed that the chips could be tracked and controlled remotely. NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang had admitted that Chinese regulators asked him about the supposed \"backdoor\" and said that he made it clear it didn't exist. \"Hopefully the response that we've given to the Chinese government will be sufficient,\" Huang said. A recent report by the Financial Times , however, claimed that Chinese authorities didn't issue warnings against using NVIDIA chips just because of security concerns. Apparently, they found certain remarks by US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick \"insulting.\" When the US allowed shipments of the H20 to China again, Lutnick said during an interview: \"We don't sell them our best stuff, not our second best stuff, not even our third best. The fourth one down, we want to keep China using it... You want to sell the Chinese enough that their developers get addicted to the American technology stack.\" The H20 is currently the most advanced AI chip NVIDIA can sell in the Chinese market, but the company is reportedly developing a more powerful product. It will be based on the company's Blackwell architecture, Reuters previously reported, and will be capable of half the computing power of NVIDIA's Blackwell Ultra GPUs.

I’m typically skeptical of the current generation of AI, but as I checked out the new software across various demo sessions, I found myself more and more intrigued. It seems like Google, along with Apple and Samsung, has been working on making these AI-powered updates more helpful in a way that might actually make our lives easier or simply more fun. There wasn’t enough time to write up every single one of them, so I’ve put a few of my favorites in this story to give you a better sense of what to expect when the Pixel 10 series hits retail shelves later this month. Spoiler alert: Many of these have to do with voice and calls — an area Google has historically excelled at. The Recorder app can generate backing music I have long been enamored with Google’s Recorder app . It started with the on-device transcription that made getting quotes from my interviews easy and relatively secure. But when Apple introduced a multi-track recording function to its Voice Memos app , I quickly jumped ship. While the iOS recorder has inferior transcription in terms of accuracy and readability, the fact that I could basically record a duet with myself seriously appealed to the musical theater geek in me. I played both Elphaba and Glinda, crooning their parts from “For Good” into my iPhone. But when Google’s senior director of product management for Pixel software Shenaz Zack told me the Pixel 10’s recorder app would add AI-generated music to your singing, I went silent in slight disbelief. I spent much of my youth ripping karaoke tracks from YouTube videos, looking up “minus one” or “backing tracks” or “instrumentals only” on various download platforms. My friends and I were aspiring performers, looking to mix our own covers of popular songs, and a tool that would generate backing music to our voice tracks would have been a dream come true. Honestly it kind of still is. Zack walked me through the process twice — on my first try I sang a verse and part of the chorus of “Golden” from the Kpop Demon Hunters soundtrack. I giggled self-consciously at the end, before Zack hit stop. As it recorded, the app actually showed a tag that indicated it knew I was singing, and when we selected the recording after, a chip appeared saying “Create and add music.” Tapping that brought up a panel titled “Choose a vibe to create music” with two sections: Featured vibes and Your vibes. Under the first one, the options were “Chill beats,” “Cozy,” “Dance party,” “Rainy day blues,” “Romantic” and “Surprise me.” On my second attempt, when I rushed through a rendition of the all-time banger “Mary Had a Little Lamb,” the app displayed a warning at the bottom that said “The beat might not match well if the recording is short.” I chose Dance Party, hit next, and waited a minute or so while Recorder went to work. The animation at the top said the system was analyzing the audio, identifying the rhythm, locking onto the beat and harmonizing the track before delivering the result. I don’t quite know what I was expecting, but I can say that those who were at all concerned about digital rights management have nothing to worry about. The music that Google generated for “Golden” sounded nothing like the original, and while it did make my voice sound less lonely and made for a more complete track, I felt like I needed a few more adjustments to feel satisfied with it. As for “Mary Had a Little Lamb,” the result was as generic as expected for an AI-generated soundtrack to a very basic nursery rhyme. To Google’s credit, what came out seemed to be in the right key and rhythm, and I certainly will need much more time playing around with this to see if tweaking the settings will help. I also wanted to point out that the generated music also stopped as my singing stopped, so the giggling I mentioned earlier was not scored. Although this feature did not live up to my (admittedly unrealistic) fantasy, I do think it’s a fun use of AI and seems harmless. It’s not going to be a mainstay of most people’s daily routines, although Zack did say that a large percent of people actually used Recorder for singing. This update could certainly make for a nice little dose of musical creativity. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Engadget (@engadget) Voice Translate made it sound like I was speaking German I had more concerns around the Voice Translate feature that was supposed to make you or your caller sound like you were speaking in a different language. According to Google, the goal is to “break down language barriers during phone calls.” When I asked Zack why the company felt the need to make the voice resemble the caller’s, she said it was about personal connection. Zack explained that her parents live in India, and though they speak English, they’re not very fluent. That makes for some difficulty when they call Zack’s kids. Simply adding a robotic voice that’s translating between the grandparents and the children wouldn’t feel right, either. I was initially skeptical that fully replacing the caller’s original voice with a translated version would help, but after a few demos, I am certainly swayed. To be clear, the person placing the call has to do so from a Pixel phone for Voice Translate to work. Once you choose Voice Translate from the Call Assist submenu, you’ll have to choose a language. When the call is connected, the system will say to both parties that the “Call is translated by Google AI in each speaker’s voice. Audio is not saved.” I tried this out a few times with a Google representative who spoke German, whom we will refer to as “Uncle Tim” to make it easier for me to describe this demo. Each time he spoke, I could hear a couple seconds of his voice in German, before a chime played and the version in the original language became softer. What sounded like a dubbed actor playing Uncle Tim came on and conversed in English, complete with realistic replications of pitch, rhythm and expression. I also could hear feedback when I talked on the call, so I heard myself speaking German on the other end. It was truly strange, because it sort of did sound like me. One of my closest friends lives in Germany, and has had to put up with my attempts to learn German for more than 10 years. I immediately wanted to try Voice Translate on her to see if she would believe I had suddenly become fluent (but of course, I’d have to figure out how to get her to ignore the warnings that Google AI was at work). I’ll be honest, the experience wasn’t perfect. Not only were the translations sometimes off (some of what Uncle Tim said in English didn’t make sense), the generated voices seemed less like a complete replication of the caller and more like a novice dubbing artist. That’s not a bad thing, since I was very concerned about impersonation being a problem. To that end, Zack said Google was deliberate about the implementation. She reminded me of the “ducking” that was in place, which is when the original speech is still audible in the first few seconds and then softer throughout. Like the original audio is ducking below the dubbed voice — get it? And I remembered that while the AI voice might sound sort of like me, it isn’t designed to simply make up things I’m saying — it’s just translating the content. I’m the one that decides whether to go off and curse out a relative and have that conveyed in their native tongue, for example. Of course, there may still be bugs and quirks to work out. I was amused by the various accents that came through in the English-speaking version of Uncle Tim. At first he sounded American, but in subsequent conversations he took on an Australian accent. All this is powered by the Pixel 10’s Tensor G5 chip and processed on-device using “a new codec and semantic understanding,” according to Zack, to understand the speaker’s vocal expressions. For now, I see what Google is going for and cannot wait to call my friend in Frankfurt. At launch, Voice Translate will support translating to or from English with Spanish, German, Japanese, French, Hindi, Italian, Portuguese, Swedish, Russian and Indonesian. Google/Screenshot by Engadget Magic Cue surfacing your flight info when you call your airline is helpful The recorder app, translation and expressive-sounding AI are areas Google has long proven expertise in. And lest we forget, the company has also been a pioneer in suggesting actions from your emails and adding events to your calendar by scanning your inbox. With the Pixel 10’s Magic Cue feature, Google is basically bringing this functionality to your texts and calls. While Magic Cue can helpfully show shortcuts within the Messages app to help you answer questions about reservations or send photos from recent trips, I’m most into one specific aspect. When you call an airline to make changes to a flight, for instance, the Pixel 10 can pull up your reservation information and display it within the call, so you won’t have to open your email, and search for the booking confirmation to have your reference number ready. Sure, it might only save you seconds, but it’s so much easier, and Google already does a version of this in your inbox. I would love to see this particular feature expand and cover other types of appointments so you can quickly get codes or other identifying information during calls to, say, your plumber, doctor, insurance provider and more. Camera and photo features continue to improve Google continues to improve upon areas it’s led the way in, and photography remains a strength of Pixel phones. The company was one of the first major players to use its algorithmic prowess to dramatically improve the quality of low light photos and with the Pixel 10 Pro it again uses computational processing to deliver superior images. Pro Res Zoom on the new phone did manage to produce some surprisingly clean pictures of faraway buildings, at least in my demo at Google’s Manhattan office. I was impressed by how clear the lines on the underside of a skyscraper that we zoomed to a 100x level on looked. Google was also careful to clarify that Pro Res Zoom won’t work on people, and that distant text may look odd. \"We've tuned Pro Res Zoom to minimize hallucinations, however they may still occur — especially with faraway text. Additionally, when Pro Res Zoom detects a person in the scene, we use a different enhancement algorithm that prevents inaccurate representations,\" according to Google. in those situations, the algorithm will drop to Super Res Zoom quality. Depending on which Pixel phone you’re using, Super Res Zoom delivers up to either 20x or 30x zoom. In the results I saw, people standing on a deck at the top of a tower just seemed a bit pixelated compared to the building’s facade, and the effect wasn’t jarring or even really noticeable until I zoomed in. But that might be because they were a tiny part of the picture — I imagine things would look different if a person was the main subject in a scene. As someone who enjoys composing pictures, I didn’t think the Camera Coach feature would do anything for me. But I was pleasantly surprised that I actually liked some of the AI’s proposed framing options. I still don’t think I’ll use this much in the real world, but it might help other people who want tips on photography. I was initially nonplussed about the new Photos feature that lets you tell the AI how to edit your pictures, but after a brief demo I came around. Simply telling Gemini to “turn that red dress blue” or “get rid of the people in the background” was not only easier, but suprrisingly effective. I also want to point out that Google also made tweaks to the Guided Frame feature in its camera app that helps those who are blind or visually impaired know what is in the scene. It now uses Gemini models, which should help with object recognition. Finally, it’s worth calling out the support for C2PA content authenticity initiative . Google is building this into the Photos app, where metadata will show whether or not AI was used in a picture. The Pixel 10 phones will be the first to implement the new industry-standard Content Credentials (CR) within its native camera app, and companies like Adobe, Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, OpenAI are all part of the initiative. An assortment of other updates worthy of mention Those were just a slice of the new AI-related features I was impressed by at my recent demos ahead of Google’s event this week. But there are quite a few more I found promising, like visual overlays in Gemini Live and the new Pixel Journal app. I didn’t spend as much time with either, but they worked in my brief demos. So did the “take a message” feature that will send transcriptions of voicemails to you, which seems like a much better way to be alerted to a missed call than a hidden section of the Phone app. I’m not yet sold on the Daily Hub, which is basically an updated version of the existing pages that sit to the left of the home page showing relevant actions and articles you might want to explore. I’m fairly intentional when it comes to looking for things to consume, and have specific apps I prefer for doomscrolling (Reddit over everything), so I’m not sure Daily Hub will suit me. Still, the fact that I liked the bulk of the new AI features coming to the Pixel 10 series is pretty significant. Of course, I will still reserve judgement until I can spend more time with them in the real world, and hope to write reviews of some of them. But it’s clear from my time with demos of the Pixel 10 that Google has been pretty thoughtful about how it imbues its hardware with AI, and I hope its competitors take notes.

However, not all companies receiving funds under the same program will need to give up equity, The Wall Street Journal has reported. Companies like TSMC and Micron that increased their US investments won't have any additional obligations, according to a government official familiar with the matter. Ealier, commerce secretary Howard Lutnick appeared to royally screw NVIDIA with comments about the company's H20 AI chips, and may have also rubbed chip giant TSMC the wrong way. \"The Biden administration literally was giving Intel [money] for free, and giving TSMC money for free, and all these companies, just giving them money for free,\" he told CNBC on Tuesday. \"Donald Trump turns that into saying, 'Hey, we want equity for the money. If we’re going to give you the money, we want a piece of the action.'\" However, TSMC may have noticed the Intel equity kerfuffle and executives reportedly held preliminary discussions about handing back subsidies if the US government asks to become a shareholder, according to the WSJ 's sources. TSMC was awarded $6.6 billion for its Arizona plant that started producing chips late last year for Apple and others. However, the company recently said it would invest another $100 billion over the next four years to build three more fabrication plants, two advanced packaging facilities and a major research and development center. Because of that extra investment, the Trump administration won't ask for a piece of TSMC or Micron (which also expanded its US facilities in Idaho, New York and Virginia). \"The Commerce Department is not looking to take equity from TSMC and Micron,\" an unnamed official said. In any case, attempts by the US government to take equity in companies will likely face legal challenges due to language in the contracts. Companies are already required to share revenue with the US government if profits rise above a certain amount. In another development, the US government may divert up to $2 billion in CHIPS Act funding toward critical minerals projects in the US, Reuters reported. The move aims to reduce US dependence on China for key minerals extensively used in the electronics and defense industries. \"The administration is creatively trying to find ways to fund the critical minerals sector,\" Reuters' source said, adding that those plans could change.

It also marks a good time to check out the tech deals available across the web. While seasonal holidays like Memorial Day and Labor Day are not the boon for tech sales that shopping events like Amazon Prime Day are, they can present good opportunities to save on things like laptops, tablets, smart home gear and more. Here, we've curated the best Labor Day sales on tech we could find this year. Since this time of year does overlap with the back-to-school season, students should be first in line to check out these deals. If you need some new gadgets for college, or refreshed tech to help you out in your first job after graduating, now's the time to see if you can get it for less. Student discounts are handy and exclusive to those who can prove their student status, but the good thing about Labor Day sales is that anyone can take advantage of them — student ID not required. Best Labor Day sales: Engadget's top picks Apple AirPods Pro 2 for $169 (32 percent off): The AirPods Pro 2 are Apple’s best set of wireless earbuds for now, as they offer the full set of Apple-focused features, strong ANC, onboard volume controls, a comfy in-ear design and a warm sound profile that most should find agreeable. They can even work as a hearing aid , though their six-hour battery life still isn’t the best, and you should only get them if you’re all-in on Apple hardware. But if that’s the case, we consider them the best wireless earbuds for iPhone owners. Apple Mac mini M4 for $499 ($100 off): The newest version of Apple’s tiny desktop PC has a smaller overall footprint, a faster M4 chip, 16GB of RAM as standard, two front-facing USB-C ports, an extra Thunderbolt 4 port and the ability to drive three external displays.

Google Pixel 10 smartphone + $100 Amazon gift card for $799 ($100 off): More of a pre-order deal than a Labor Day deal, this bundle includes a free gift card when you order the latest Google Pixel phone in advance.

That combined with their weather-proof design allows you to place them both inside and outside. Eufy 11S Max robot vacuum for $150 (46 percent off): This model is one of our favorite budget robot vacuums thanks to its slim design that lets you get underneath furniture more easily and strong suction power for its size. Note that it does not have Wi-Fi connectivity, but it comes with a remote that lets you control the robot to your liking. Shark AI Ultra robot vacuum for $298 (50 percent off): This Shark robot vacuum is a version of one of our favorites and it comes with a auto-empty base that can hold up to 60 days worth of debris. It has strong suction power and home mapping capabilities, so you can tailor cleaning jobs to your liking in addition to putting the robot on a cleaning schedule. Cosori 9-in-1 air fryer for $90 (25 percent off): One of our picks for the best air fryers , this Cosori model has a spacious six-quart cooking basket and nine prep modes to choose from. In our testing, it consistently crisped up all kinds of foods, from frozen appetizers to raw proteins, and it has a nifty safety feature with its built-in basket release button. HORI Piranha Plant camera for Switch 2 for $40 (33 percent off): If you plan on taking advantage of the Switch 2's video and group chat feature, there's no cuter way to do it than with this Piranha Plant camera. In addition to using it with the pot as a stand, the plant itself detaches from the pot so you can use the camera in portable mode with the USB port on the new console. ESPN Unlimited with Disney+ and Hulu (with ads) for $30/month ($6/month off): ESPN’s new streaming service is officially available now, and new subscribers can get Disney+ and Hulu included for one year when they sign up.
