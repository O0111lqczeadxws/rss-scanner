It's been a very busy week in that realm, thanks to Gamescom. Before we jam through a few of this week's new releases and some of the many, many Gamescom reveals, there's one game that has risen high above the din to the point where it's drowning out many of the smaller announcements. Yes, Hollow Knight: Silksong has a release date , and it's very, very soon. September 4, in fact. I feel for all the developers who have games coming out around the same time, such as Cronos: The New Dawn , Hell is Us, Baby Steps and even NBA 2K26 . Sure, Silksong may primarily be for a different audience than the latest edition of a massive basketball franchise, but it's going to take up much of the oxygen in the gaming space for a while. As such, some developers are delaying their games to give Silksong a wide berth. CloverPit was scheduled to drop on September 3, but it's getting the hell out of Silksong 's way. The grimy, slot machine-based roguelike is now going to arrive on September 26. \"We like a gamble, but this one is too risky lol,\" developer Panik Arcade said. \"We want to give ourselves and our fans some time to enjoy Silksong , so we’re launching a few weeks later and will use the time to polish CloverPit even further.\" Meanwhile, Talegames is pushing back the 1.0 release of its adventure RPG Faeland and Aeternum Game Studios is delaying a Metroidvania called Aeterna Lucis from September into 2026. There's no doubt that Silksong's arrival is a big deal. It's been the most wishlisted game on Steam for yonks, was a focus of Microsoft's Xbox Ally handheld reveal and is a sequel to an indie blockbuster that has now sold more than 15 million copies . In any case, we'll soon find out if that very, very long wait was worthwhile. Years of Silksong memes sure were. I’m going to need some other long-awaited game to joke about before every showcase now. New releases I have no earthly idea why it took me so long to try this, but I tested my PlayStation Portal by my building's pool for the first time this week and it turned out that the Wi-Fi was, in fact, strong enough there for me to use the handheld. It was a fitting place to check out Sword of the Sea , which hit PS5 (including on PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium) and PC this week. I'm only an hour or so into this $30 game from Giant Squid, but I'm enjoying the relaxed approach to exploration here. As you'd might expect from developers who have worked on The Pathless , Abzu and Journey , the movement in Sword of the Sea is delightful . You'll take off from wavy dunes and pull off tricks like you're in an SSX game as you surf across sand and water on a sword in the aim of restoring life to the barren landscape. Sword of the Sea is a looker, and I'll surely be getting lost in it some more over the coming days. Speaking of games that have an eye-catching aesthetic, Herdling is another exploration and adventure title that dropped this week. This one's from Okomotive ( Far: Changing Tides, Far: Lone Sails ) and publisher Panic. Here, you'll be guiding a ragtag herd of beasts across hilly terrain toward the summit of a mountain. You'll have to solve some \"light\" environmental puzzles and even endure some stampedes along the way. Herdling typically costs $25, but there's a 25 percent launch discount. It's available on Steam , Epic Games Store , PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, Nintendo Switch and Switch 2. It's on Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass too. With Ball x Pit on the horizon, I figured we were all taken care of for the foreseeable future as far as Breakout -esque roguelites go. Not so fast, said the team behind Vampire Survivors . Poncle has spun up its own publishing arm and the second game it's releasing (after Berserk or Die ) is Kill the Brickman from Doonutsaur. Poncle released the game on Steam and Xbox without prior warning this week, and it costs five bucks. You'll collect and augment various bullets that you use to destroy bricks from outer space. There's a lot going on in the minute-long trailer, but I particularly love how some of the bricks \"cry\" when a bullet smacks into them. Discounty is a life sim about managing a supermarket in a small town. Hopefully, you'll be a more magnanimous proprietor than the operators of the JoJa Mart in Stardew Valley , but you'll still have to deal with some folks who are none too pleased about the effect of the business on their town. Developer Crinkle Cut Games and publisher PQube suggest there are some secrets to discover in Discounty , which is out now on Nintendo Switch, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, Steam and Epic Games Store . It's coming to GOG as well at a later date. The game typically costs $20, though there's a 20 percent launch discount on PC. Upcoming Engadget senior reporter Igor Bonifacic spent a few hours with Absolum , a fantasy beat-'em-up with a roguelite spin from co-developers Guard Crush Games and Supamonk and publisher Dotemu ( Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge , Streets of Rage 4 ). I highly recommend reading his write up for the full lowdown as Absolum sounds like a real treat. The demo for this slipped through the cracks for me during the early June chaos of Summer Game Fest and Steam Next Fest, but it's still available and I'll absolutely be checking it out to get a taste of Absolum before it arrives on October 4. It's coming to Steam , Nintendo Switch, PS4 and PS5. As I mentioned in our liveblog for Gamescom Opening Night Live this week, any new Ron Gilbert game is worth getting excited about. He's the director of the first two Monkey Island games and Return to Monkey Island , as well as a developer and producer of so many other projects over the years. Death by Scrolling . is something completely different for Gilbert. It's a vertical-scrolling, action-heavy roguelite in which you need to stay alive and earn enough gold to pay a toll to a ferryman to escape from the afterlife. The look is very heavily reminiscent of Stardew , so if plundering the mines in that game was more your jam than farming and fishing, this might be up your alley. There's no release date as yet for Death by Scrolling , which Gilbert started working on back in 2019, but it's said to be coming this year. In the meantime, you can read updates about the game's development on Gilbert's terrific blog . It's fun that we had mentions of two John Carpenter-related projects at Gamescom this week. Not only was there another look at John Carpenter's Toxic Commando during Opening Night Live , there was the reveal of Halloween the Game from IllFonic and co-publisher Gun Interactive. Set to arrive in 2026, Halloween the Game follows the likes of Friday the 13th: The Game (from the same teams) and the Gun-published The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. It has a 1 vs. 4 asynchronous multiplayer mode in which the quartet will have to use anything at their disposal — from wielding weapons to calling the cops — to survive the threat of the unkillable Michael Myers. There's going to be a single-player aspect to this game as well, as you'll be able to control the legendary mass killer in an adaptation of the original film's story. Halloween the Game is coming to PlayStation , Xbox , Steam and Epic Games Store . A game about a guy with a brown backpack who scours ruined, overgrown suburban homes in search of valuable resources that can help him survive a bunch of zombies in the post-apocalypse? It has to be Long Gone , of course! What other game could you possibly be thinking of? This is a linear pixel-art narrative adventure from Hillfort Games and co-publisher Outersloth ( Among Us studio Innersloth's publishing wing ). The developers seem to have been influenced by a little game you might have heard of called... Gone Home , as you'll look through the belongings of people who used to live in this world and learn the truth about what happened. There's no combat here. Instead, zombie encounters require puzzle solving. There's no release window as yet for this point-and-click game, which is coming to Steam . Fittingly enough, I've had my eye on Militsoner for some time, so I was delighted to hear that there's a two-week playtest on Steam that's open to everyone. This is an immersive sim in which you'll try to escape a town, but that may not be too easy as there's an enormous policeman watching your every move. The playtest is limited to a slice of the town, but I'm really looking forward to getting in there and finding out what this is all about. I have to hold my hands up here and admit I'm not familiar with puzzle game maker Rusty Lake. But when the trailer for their next game popped up this week, it had me utterly captivated, because Servant of the Lake looks very, very pretty. This is a point-and-click puzzle adventure that will see you carrying out tasks as seemingly innocuous as straightening picture frames to helping with experiments and cleaning up afterward. You'll play as a housekeeper of an estate, but it's not entirely clear whether you'll be able to survive the weekend... Servant of the Lake is coming to Steam , Itch.io, iOS and Android in Spring 2026. BPM: Bullets Per Minute developer Awe Interactive is back with another rhythm-based shooter, albeit one that has a top-down perspective instead of a first-person one. BPM Bitcrushed (which is being published by Kwalee) is a roguelite, pixel art dungeon crawler that syncs shooting, jumping and dodging to the beat. The dungeons are procedurally generated and there's a \"wide variety of powerful weapons, unique items and rhythm-based abilities\" to discover. What's most interesting to me here though is that, along with the game's own soundtrack, you can load in your own tunes via the custom music feature. Perhaps setting the action to some slow-tempo sludge metal will make things a bit easier. Couch Planes is an arcade plane racer from Skylab Interactive that's coming to Steam , Epic Games Store and consoles next year. There are a few different modes, 15 maps with environmental hazards and collectable power ups including homing rockets, mines and speed boosts. There's support for four-person local multiplayer and 12-player online action. From Starfox and Grand Theft Auto V to The Falconeer and Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 , I've never been much good at flying in games. But hey, Couch Planes looks like it could be a fun time with friends. Let's close out this bumper post-Gamescom edition of our indie games roundup with something that might not be for me, but could be for you. Canvas City is the first project from Disc 2 Games, which is self-publishing the game with help from Dredge studio Black Salt Games. Turn-based tactics games aren't typically my jam, but I'm always going to have at least some interest in one that's about a group of upstarts rebelling against an oppressive force. In this case, you'll take charge of skaters and street artists who are fighting back in a \"vibrant yet suppressed urban world\" (which sounds a little similar to Unbeatable , which this week got a November 6 release date). What caught my attention here is that fluid movement is a key part of the game. When it's your turn, you can use rails, ramps and other parts of the environment to pull off combinations of tricks and attacks. These chained actions can also earn you Style Points that can enhance your abilities. Disc 2 hasn't revealed a release window for Canvas City as yet. It's in development for Steam and Nintendo Switch.

According to Alexandr Wang, Meta's Chief AI Officer, Meta is licensing Midjourney's \"aesthetic technology\" for its future models and products. \"To ensure Meta is able to deliver the best possible products for people it will require taking an all-of-the-above approach. This means world-class talent, ambitious compute roadmap, and working with the best players across the industry,\" Wang added. 1/ Today we’re proud to announce a partnership with @midjourney , to license their aesthetic technology for our future models and products, bringing beauty to billions. — Alexandr Wang (@alexandr_wang) August 22, 2025 The company previously launched its own AI image generator and AI video editor , but Midjourney's technology could help Meta offer services that can actually compete with rivals', such as OpenAI's Sora and Google's Veo . Midjourney made V7 its default model for image generation back in June. It described V7 as an \"entirely new\" AI image generation model that's much smarter at processing text prompts than its predecessors. It also released its V1 video model , which allows users to turn the images they generate into a short animated video, at the same time. \"We are incredibly impressed by Midjourney. They have accomplished true feats of technical and aesthetic excellence, and we are thrilled to be working more closely with them,\" Wang said on X. This partnership is but Meta's latest move in its quest to form a Superintelligence laboratory and become a major player in the AI sphere. Mark Zuckerberg went on a hiring spreed and managed to convince several key players from rivals to join his company instead by offering them massive salaries and signing bonuses. Wang himself became the company's Chief AI office after Meta invested $14.8 billion in Scale AI, the company he founded.

Bluesky says that while it does follow the UK's Online Safety Act , it works very differently from Mississippi's approach to age verification. In the UK, it's only required to check for a user's age if they're accessing certain content and features. In Mississippi, however, it cannot allow anyone to access its service at all, unless they hand over sensitive data proving how old they are. Further, the platform will be required to keep track of which users are children under 18, and it will be responsible for making sure those users won't be able to access \"harmful materials.\" Earlier this month, the Supreme Court decided not to intervene with the legislation, allowing it to go into effect. The service says that it doesn't have the significant resources needed to be able to build the required \"verification systems, parental consent workflows and compliance infrastructure.\" In addition, it could be penalized with up $10,000 per user if the government finds it to be non-compliant. Because only big tech companies can afford the costs associated with those requirements, Bluesky says the \"dynamic entrenches existing big tech platforms while stifling the innovation and competition that benefits users.\" Bluesky will now show a note to any user accessing the service from Mississippi, telling them why it's no longer available in the state.

While seasonal holidays like Memorial Day and Labor Day aren’t the boon for tech deals as Prime Day or Black Friday can be, you can still find some good deals across the web. That’s particularly true if you’re going back to school soon, or are shopping for someone imminently heading back to campus. Engadget has you covered for all of the best Labor Day sales on tech. Since this time of year does overlap with the back-to-school season, students should be first in line to check out these deals. If you need some new gadgets for college, or refreshed tech to help you out in your first job after graduating, now's the time to see if you can get it for less. Student discounts are handy and exclusive to those who can prove their student status, but the good thing about Labor Day sales is that anyone can take advantage of them — student ID not required. Best Labor Day sales: Engadget's top picks Apple AirPods Pro 2 for $169 (32 percent off): The AirPods Pro 2 are Apple’s best set of wireless earbuds for now, as they offer the full set of Apple-focused features, strong ANC, onboard volume controls, a comfy in-ear design and a warm sound profile that most should find agreeable. They can even work as a hearing aid , though their six-hour battery life still isn’t the best, and you should only get them if you’re all-in on Apple hardware. But if that’s the case, we consider them the best wireless earbuds for iPhone owners. Apple iPad (11-inch, A16) for $299 ($50 off): Apple's entry-level iPad is, unsurprisingly, the best iPad option for those on a budget. It has solid performance thanks to the A16 chipset, 128GB of storage in the base model and good battery life. Apple Mac mini M4 for $499 ($100 off): The newest version of Apple’s tiny desktop PC has a smaller overall footprint, a faster M4 chip, 16GB of RAM as standard, two front-facing USB-C ports, an extra Thunderbolt 4 port and the ability to drive three external displays. We gave the M4 Pro model a review score of 90 . Google Pixel 10 smartphone + $100 Amazon gift card for $799 ($100 off): More of a pre-order deal than a Labor Day deal, this bundle includes a free gift card when you order the latest Google Pixel phone in advance.

One of the more charming peripherals, the HORI Piranha Plant camera, is on sale right now for only $40. That's $20 off and a record-low price. It's a good deal for anyone who wants to take advantage of the Switch 2's camera functionality in games like Mario Kart World and that recently-released campfire sim . This was designed specifically for Nintendo's new console, so it's a plug-and-play affair. It's actually cheaper than the official Switch 2 camera with this sale and it looks a whole lot cooler. It's a Piranha Plant from the Mario franchise. We called it a \"work of art\" upon encountering the device and that holds true today. This thing is not only stylish, resembling an Amiibo more than a camera, but it's downright useful. The pot the Piranha Plant sits in functions as both a stand and USB extension for the device. The plant itself detaches from the pot, so the camera can be used in portable mode by popping it into the USB port at the top of the console. There's also a built-in privacy shutter. Just close the plant's mouth to obscure the lens. The actual camera specs here aren't going to win any awards, with a frame rate of 30FPS and a resolution of 640 x 480p. However, that's more than enough to capture footage of your floating head to accompany your kart as it races through the Mushroom Kingdom.

Local authorities have granted the company the permit needed to be able to test autonomous vehicles in parts of Manhattan and Downtown Brooklyn. It's the first-ever permit for the \"testing deployment\" of AVs the city has granted. Waymo will be able to deploy a fleet with up to eight vehicles in the city until late September 2025. For now, though, the permit only allows Waymo to test its AVs with drivers behind the wheel. The company announced earlier this year that it was going to test its driverless system in 10 new cities in 2025. In June, it filed a request for permission to test its AVs in New York City in hopes that it can someday bring its autonomous ride-hailing service to the Big Apple. To note, while Adams said the city granted Waymo the first permit of its kind, the company deployed its vehicles to map some parts of NYC back in 2021 . Under the permit, Waymo will be required to regularly report the data gathered from its testing to the Department of Transportation to certify that it's \"adhering to the industry’s best practices related to cybersecurity.\" Waymo will be given the opportunity to apply for an extension after its pilot testing period ends in September. It may have to continue testing them with human operators for a while, though: New York state law prohibits the operation of vehicles without a driver behind the wheel, but Waymo told Forbes that it's lobbying to change the regulation.

The studio announced on the official Assassin's Creed X account that there will be a new story chapter and missions for protagonist Basim, who will venture into ninth-century alUla. More importantly, the DLC will be free. According to the post, Ubisoft will bring gameplay improvements to both the new content and the base game, which revisits the franchise 's roots that emphasize open-world design and stealth combat. The announcement from Ubisoft comes after a Les Echos report earlier in the year said that new content for Assassin's Creed Mirage was created thanks to a partnership between Ubisoft and Savvy Games Group, a gaming and esports company that has backing from the Saudi Arabian government. The upcoming DLC sheds more light on what Stephane Boudon, one of the Ubisoft developers for Assassin's Creed Mirage , teased during a Reddit AMA following the game's release in October 2023. In the thread, Boudon said the game was designed \"as a standalone experience without any DLC plan,\" only adding that the team had \"ideas of how we could extend the story of Basim.\" Ubisoft didn't specify exactly when the DLC would drop, only revealing that it would be \"later this year.\" In the meantime, Microsoft updated its included games for the Xbox Game Pass for August, which include Assassin's Creed Mirage .

Apple's lawsuit listed Chen Shi, a former employee who worked on the Apple Watch team, along with Oppo , as defendants, claiming they \"conspired to steal Apple’s trade secrets.\" According to the lawsuit, Shi worked as a Sensor System Architect for the Apple Watch from January 2020 to June 2025, but was seeking employment with Oppo as early as April 2025. Apple claimed that its former employee didn't disclose that he was leaving to join Oppo and instead said he was going back to China to look after his elderly parents and didn't have any plans to find a new job. However, the lawsuit said that Shi \"set up and attended dozens of one-on-one meetings\" with Apple Watch team members to learn about their work on \"optical sensors, temperature sensors, and ECG sensors.\" In the lawsuit, Shi allegedly downloaded 63 files from one of Apple's protected folders and transferred the material to a USB drive before searching the internet for \"how to wipe out [a] macbook\" and \"can somebody see if I’ve opened a file on a shared drive?” Along with these claims, Apple said in the lawsuit that Shi sent a message to his future Oppo employers that he would \"collect as much information as possible\" about Apple's health-sensing technologies. Oppo has since provided a statement to MacRumors about Apple's lawsuit, claiming that it has \"found no evidence establishing any connection between these allegations and the employee's conduct during his employment at OPPO.\" The company statement also said that OPPO has not \"misappropriated Apple's trade secrets.\" It's not the first time that Apple has taken legal action against one of its former employees. Earlier this summer, the company sued a design engineer, alleging that he stole trade secrets about the Vision Pro and shared them with his new employer, Snap.

Luckily, NordVPN sits in the latter category, and right now Nord is offering discounted plans across its various tiers. If you take out a two-year NordVPN Plus plan (the company's most popular plan) it’ll cost you $108 for the duration of the contract, with Nord throwing in three extra months at no extra cost. That’s 73 percent off the usual rate. As well as Nord’s VPN service, a Plus plan also includes the Threat Protection Pro anti-malware tool, password management and an ad- and tracker-blocker. A Prime plan additionally comes with encrypted cloud storage or NordProtect, which insures you against identity theft and monitors dark web activity. That's also on sale — down to $189 on the same two-year commitment with those three additional months thrown in, which works out to a 77 percent savings on the regular price. When Engadget’s Sam Chapman reviewed NordVPN earlier this year, he praised its excellent download speeds, exclusive features and extensive server network. Less impressive is its clunky interface and inconsistent design when jumping between different platforms running a NordVPN app. While it doesn't quite make the cut in our guide to the best VPNs available right now, it generally performed well in speed tests and Threat Protection Pro is really worth having.

In patch notes posted ahead of the new season, the Overwatch 2 team says matchmaking pools will be tweaked slightly so players are sorted into a Mouse and Keyboard Pool and a Controller Pool. Those playing on a console using keyboard and mouse (KBM) inputs will be paired with PC players and other KBM console players, while the Controller Pool will be reserved only for console players using a controller. Season 18 arrives on August 26. For players who switch to the Mouse and Keyboard Pool, \"your internal MMR, skill ratings and ranks for all game modes will be separate from your statistics in the Controller Pool,\" according to the patch notes. This group won't have access to aim assist, as has been the case and will continue to be for PC players using a controller. KBM players will have to accept the prompt to switch to that pool in order to play, or manually switch in the Gameplay Options menu.
