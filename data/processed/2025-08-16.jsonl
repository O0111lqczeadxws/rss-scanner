You might remember this model as the XPS 14, and according to Sam, Dell retained \"the DNA\" that made previous versions some of the best notebook PCs you could buy. \"Even with a new and rather uninspired name, it probably shouldn't come as a surprise that the Dell 14 Premium remains one of the best Windows laptops on the market,\" he said . \"It has the same sleek design from back when it was still called the XPS 14 but with some refreshed specs and components for 2025.\" Framework Desktop (2025) Framework is known for its modular, repairable laptops, but the company has now tried its hand at bringing the same formula to a desktop. Unfortunately, the first attempt isn't nearly as modular or repairable as a regular PC, according to senior editor Daniel Cooper. \"Framework was open about the fact this was something akin to a side project, outside its regular remit to build modular laptops, based on a particularly exciting chip,\" he explained . \"So while I think the all-in-one approach is a backward step compared to regular PCs, I get the rationale for doing so here.\" Sony Bravia Theater Bar 6 This year's crop of soundbars finally arrived over the summer, so I've been spending lots of time with home theater speakers recently. The latest was the Sony Bravia Theater Bar 6, a soundbar/subwoofer combo that sits in the middle of the company's current lineup. Despite great sound and dialogue performance, the caveats here are real dealbreakers. \"The lack of Wi-Fi on a $650 soundbar is absurd, mostly because it strips users of the convenience of AirPlay, Chromecast and other wireless connection options,\" I wrote . \"I also can’t get over the need to use a thumb drive for updates when OTA downloads for new firmware have been the norm on soundbars for years.\" Lenovo ThinkPad X9-14 Aura Edition Lenovo's ThinkPads are popular office laptops, and the X9-14 is the latest in a long line of business machines. Contributing writer Rami Tabari explains that this model offers a lot of the qualities that make ThinkPads great, but the price, low-power CPU and subpar keyboard leave something to be desired. \"I can’t justify the average consumer paying $1,283 for the ThinkPad X9-14 with specs you’d find in laptops that cost hundreds of dollars less (minus the RAM, of course),\" he noted . \"For small business owners, I recommend waiting for a sale or consider a business laptop marketed more toward you (again, the ASUS ExpertBook P5 (P5405) is a great choice).\" watchOS 26 preview and Norton VPN review We're quickly approaching the arrival of a new set of Apple Watches, so senior buying advice reporter Amy Skorheim spent two weeks with the upcoming version of watchOS. Her favorite new features are the AI workout partner and added gesture, but she explained that it's the little things that make this annual overhaul worthwhile. Meanwhile, senior writer Sam Chapman returned to the land of VPNs to test Norton's version as a standalone app. While this service isn't necessarily bad, it also doesn't offer enough to rise above the heap that includes ExpressVPN, Surfshark and others. \"After a week of working with Norton VPN, I have to conclude that the only way it distinguishes itself is the Norton name,\" he said . \"For everything else it does, a competitor does it better.\" This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/engadget-review-recap-dell-14-premium-framework-desktop-sony-theater-bar-6-and-more-130008670.html?src=rss", "ingested_utc": "2025-08-16T13:48:59Z"}

It’s more powerful and available in a larger size than the entry-level iPad, but a lot less expensive than the iPad Pro, which can be overkill for some. Right now, there's a great Apple iPad Air M3 price drop on Amazon: you can get one for $150 less than usual. This deal applies to each configuration of the 11-inch and 13-inch versions of the most recent iPad Air. So, the 11-inch model is as low as $449, while the 13-inch model is down to $649. The same deals can be found at Best Buy and Target if you prefer to shop somewhere other than Amazon. This is an all-time low price and beats the deal we saw on Prime Day by $30. The iPad Air M3 is more of an iterative refresh than a grand overhaul, but the spec bump means it’ll last you a long time before the tablet’s performance becomes a problem. This iPad occupies the position of \"best for most\" in our iPad buying guide , reinforcing that goldilocks analogy. The M3 chip is the main draw here, with Geekbench 6 scores proclaiming it around 16 percent more powerful than the M2 iPad Air, which is no slouch itself. Beyond the chip, it has a superior display and speakers to the entry-level model , and wider accessory support. You also get the option of a 13-inch display, which is great for artists or anyone who sees the iPad as a viable laptop replacement. If there’s an obvious downside to the iPad Air M3, it’s that it doesn't have the nice 120Hz OLED display of the iPad Pro. This is hardly surprising, as Apple often focuses on display tech to differentiate its Pro and non-Pro devices, but it’s probably time the refresh rate on the middle-of-the-road iPad at least jumped up to ProMotion. Face ID is long overdue too. If you can live with these caveats, though, the iPad Air is an excellent option, particularly at this price. There are a couple of other iPads on sale at Amazon right now, too, if you think the Air is too much for your needs. The iPad A16 , Apple's entry-level tablet, is down to $299, while the latest iPad mini is on sale for $399. Both models were slightly cheaper during Prime Day in July, but these discounts are still worth considering if you're looking to pick up a newer iPad for less.

So simple you might not understand who you're sharing it without digging into your settings. That's naturally led to confusion from some Instagram users as to how the feature works. If you already spend a lot of time on Instagram and are looking for a way to see where your friends have been, it's worth familiarizing yourself with how Instagram Map works. And if you're worried about what information Instagram is broadcasting without your knowledge, you might as well get comfortable with the feature's settings. Here's how to do both in the Instagram app. How to use Instagram Map Ian Carlos Campbell for Engadget To access Instagram Map, you'll have to head to the DMs section of Instagram, and then tap on the Map icon in the top row of status icons. The first time you tap on the map, Instagram will walk you through how Instagram Map shares your location, and why Location Services needs to be enabled for it will work. Then, if you're not already sharing your location with Instagram, you'll receive a pop-up from your phone asking if you want to share your location. Tapping through that will take you to the map itself. The majority of the Instagram Map is taken up by a map displaying your current location, with a search bar at the bottom for looking up the location of your friends. Scroll around for a bit and your might see a profile picture marking a friend's current location, or miniature posts tagged with a specific location. There's a few basic things you can do with Instagram Map: Swipe around and see friends' posts displayed geographically Use the search bar to find a friend's current location or recent tagged posts Tap on a friend to be taken to their profile, or a post to see it in full Instagram Map is primarily informational. It can tell your where your friends are or where they've recently been, and let you view content based on where it was posted. It's really not much more complicated then that. Unless you're picky about who can see your location. How to stop sharing your location with Instagram Map Ian Carlos Campbell for Engadget Sharing your location on Instagram Map is opt-in. Your current location won't be shared on Instagram unless you actively choose to share it. What will be there are any posts that have a location tagged in them, something that's an option every time you add photos and videos to your Stories or your grid. Instagram gives you four different sharing options for the Map. You can share with: Friends: Followers that you follow back Close Friends: Followers already in your Close Friends list Only these friends: Specific people you choose No one: Don't share your location (except for posts with tagged locations) So to disable location sharing entirely in Instagram Map, or change who can see your location: Open the Instagram app. Tap on the DMs icon in the top-right corner . Tap on the Map icon. Tap on the Location Settings menu (shaped like a gear) in the top-right corner. And then tap on \"No one\" , to disable location sharing. To change who you share your location with, follow the same steps except instead of choosing \"No one,\" choose one of the other options Instagram offers. How to never share specific locations on Instagram Map Ian Carlos Campbell for Engadget For even more granular control over location sharing, you can also add specific locations to a list of \"Hidden Places\" that will never appear on Instagram Map while you're visiting. If you want to modify that list, open the Map feature, then: Tap on Location Settings (the gear icon) in the top-right corner. Tap on the three-dot menu in the corner of the settings menu. Tap on Hide Places . Tap and drag a pin on the map to mark a hidden place, and then set a radius around it with the slider. Type in the name of the place and then tap Done .

In 2023, Elon Musk's X filed a lawsuit against the media watchdog following an advertiser exodus. It accused Media Matters of \"knowingly and maliciously manufactur[ing] side-by-side images depicting advertisers' posts on X Corp.'s social media platform beside Neo-Nazi and white national fringe content.\" Just this May, the FTC started looking into whether the nonprofit violated antitrust laws by allegedly colluding with advertising and advocacy groups to boycott X. In June, Media Matters sued the FTC , accusing it of unfairly targeting the group in retaliation for past criticisms of X. \"The Federal Trade Commission seeks to punish Media Matters for its journalism and speech in exposing matters of substantial public concern — including how X.com has enabled and profited from extremist content that proliferated after Elon Musk took over the platform formerly known as Twitter,\" the group said at the time. Now, Judge Sparkle L. Sooknanan has granted a preliminary injunction in the nonprofit's favor. Sooknanan has agreed with the group that the FTC's investigation is \"a retaliatory act\" and has noted that it is \"likely to succeed on its First Amendment retaliation claim.\" She wrote in her decision that such probes would deter other reporters from speaking again. \"Indeed, the FTC's [investigation] has had its intended effect.\" Apparently, because of the probe, Media Matters has \"decided against pursuing certain stories about the FTC, Chairman Ferguson, and Mr. Musk.\" \"The court’s ruling demonstrates the importance of fighting over folding, which far too many are doing when confronted with intimidation from the Trump administration,\" Angelo Carusone, the president of Media Matters, told The New York Times . \"We will continue to stand up and fight for the First Amendment rights that protect every American.\" As the publication notes, courts had also blocked investigations into the group by the attorneys general in Texas and Missouri. Musk's lawsuits against the nonprofit, however, are still ongoing.

To address recent concerns, Roblox published a post on its website detailing these major changes, including restricting all unrated experiences, which is what Roblox calls its user-generated games, to the developer or those actively working with them. Roblox said this change will roll out in the coming months, representing a big shift from its previous policy that allowed users 13 or older to access unrated experiences. To further prevent any inappropriate behavior, any \"social hangout\" experiences that depict private spaces, like bedrooms or bathrooms, will be limited to ID-verified users who are 17 or older. Roblox will also restrict social hangout games that mostly take place in those previously-mentioned private spaces or adult-only places, like bars or clubs, to users who are at least 17 and have been ID-verified. To assist with the new rules, Roblox will roll out a new tool that automatically detects \"violative scenes,\" or more simply, user activity that goes against the rules. According to Roblox's new policies, a server that hits enough violations will automatically get taken down and will have to work with the Roblox team to adjust the experience and get it back online. These policy changes come after several lawsuits were filed against Roblox that claim the game doesn't protect its younger users. In response to the lawsuit filed by Louisiana's attorney general, Roblox wrote in a separate post that it works to block any efforts at exploitative behavior and constantly enhances its moderation approaches. \"Any assertion that Roblox would intentionally put our users at risk of exploitation is simply untrue,\" the company statement read. \"No system is perfect and bad actors adapt to evade detection, including efforts to take users to other platforms, where safety standards and moderation practices may differ.
