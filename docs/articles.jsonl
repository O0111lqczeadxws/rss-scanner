To address recent concerns, Roblox published a post on its website detailing these major changes, including restricting all unrated experiences, which is what Roblox calls its user-generated games, to the developer or those actively working with them. Roblox said this change will roll out in the coming months, representing a big shift from its previous policy that allowed users 13 or older to access unrated experiences. To further prevent any inappropriate behavior, any \"social hangout\" experiences that depict private spaces, like bedrooms or bathrooms, will be limited to ID-verified users who are 17 or older. Roblox will also restrict social hangout games that mostly take place in those previously-mentioned private spaces or adult-only places, like bars or clubs, to users who are at least 17 and have been ID-verified. To assist with the new rules, Roblox will roll out a new tool that automatically detects \"violative scenes,\" or more simply, user activity that goes against the rules. According to Roblox's new policies, a server that hits enough violations will automatically get taken down and will have to work with the Roblox team to adjust the experience and get it back online. These policy changes come after several lawsuits were filed against Roblox that claim the game doesn't protect its younger users.

In 2023, Elon Musk's X filed a lawsuit against the media watchdog following an advertiser exodus. It accused Media Matters of \"knowingly and maliciously manufactur[ing] side-by-side images depicting advertisers' posts on X Corp.'s social media platform beside Neo-Nazi and white national fringe content.\" Just this May, the FTC started looking into whether the nonprofit violated antitrust laws by allegedly colluding with advertising and advocacy groups to boycott X. In June, Media Matters sued the FTC , accusing it of unfairly targeting the group in retaliation for past criticisms of X. \"The Federal Trade Commission seeks to punish Media Matters for its journalism and speech in exposing matters of substantial public concern — including how X.com has enabled and profited from extremist content that proliferated after Elon Musk took over the platform formerly known as Twitter,\" the group said at the time. Now, Judge Sparkle L. Sooknanan has granted a preliminary injunction in the nonprofit's favor. Sooknanan has agreed with the group that the FTC's investigation is \"a retaliatory act\" and has noted that it is \"likely to succeed on its First Amendment retaliation claim.\" She wrote in her decision that such probes would deter other reporters from speaking again. \"Indeed, the FTC's [investigation] has had its intended effect.\" Apparently, because of the probe, Media Matters has \"decided against pursuing certain stories about the FTC, Chairman Ferguson, and Mr. Musk.\" \"The court’s ruling demonstrates the importance of fighting over folding, which far too many are doing when confronted with intimidation from the Trump administration,\" Angelo Carusone, the president of Media Matters, told The New York Times . \"We will continue to stand up and fight for the First Amendment rights that protect every American.\" As the publication notes, courts had also blocked investigations into the group by the attorneys general in Texas and Missouri. Musk's lawsuits against the nonprofit, however, are still ongoing.

The same deals can be found at Best Buy and Target if you prefer to shop somewhere other than Amazon. This is an all-time low price and beats the deal we saw on Prime Day by $30. The iPad Air M3 is more of an iterative refresh than a grand overhaul, but the spec bump means it’ll last you a long time before the tablet’s performance becomes a problem. This iPad occupies the position of \"best for most\" in our iPad buying guide , reinforcing that goldilocks analogy. The M3 chip is the main draw here, with Geekbench 6 scores proclaiming it around 16 percent more powerful than the M2 iPad Air, which is no slouch itself. Beyond the chip, it has a superior display and speakers to the entry-level model , and wider accessory support. You also get the option of a 13-inch display, which is great for artists or anyone who sees the iPad as a viable laptop replacement. If there’s an obvious downside to the iPad Air M3, it’s that it doesn't have the nice 120Hz OLED display of the iPad Pro. This is hardly surprising, as Apple often focuses on display tech to differentiate its Pro and non-Pro devices, but it’s probably time the refresh rate on the middle-of-the-road iPad at least jumped up to ProMotion. Face ID is long overdue too. If you can live with these caveats, though, the iPad Air is an excellent option, particularly at this price. There are a couple of other iPads on sale at Amazon right now, too, if you think the Air is too much for your needs. The iPad A16 , Apple's entry-level tablet, is down to $299, while the latest iPad mini is on sale for $399. Both models were slightly cheaper during Prime Day in July, but these discounts are still worth considering if you're looking to pick up a newer iPad for less.

So simple you might not understand who you're sharing it without digging into your settings. That's naturally led to confusion from some Instagram users as to how the feature works. If you already spend a lot of time on Instagram and are looking for a way to see where your friends have been, it's worth familiarizing yourself with how Instagram Map works. And if you're worried about what information Instagram is broadcasting without your knowledge, you might as well get comfortable with the feature's settings. Here's how to do both in the Instagram app. How to use Instagram Map Ian Carlos Campbell for Engadget To access Instagram Map, you'll have to head to the DMs section of Instagram, and then tap on the Map icon in the top row of status icons. The first time you tap on the map, Instagram will walk you through how Instagram Map shares your location, and why Location Services needs to be enabled for it will work. Then, if you're not already sharing your location with Instagram, you'll receive a pop-up from your phone asking if you want to share your location. Tapping through that will take you to the map itself. The majority of the Instagram Map is taken up by a map displaying your current location, with a search bar at the bottom for looking up the location of your friends. Scroll around for a bit and your might see a profile picture marking a friend's current location, or miniature posts tagged with a specific location. There's a few basic things you can do with Instagram Map: Swipe around and see friends' posts displayed geographically Use the search bar to find a friend's current location or recent tagged posts Tap on a friend to be taken to their profile, or a post to see it in full Instagram Map is primarily informational. It can tell your where your friends are or where they've recently been, and let you view content based on where it was posted. It's really not much more complicated then that. Unless you're picky about who can see your location. How to stop sharing your location with Instagram Map Ian Carlos Campbell for Engadget Sharing your location on Instagram Map is opt-in. Your current location won't be shared on Instagram unless you actively choose to share it. What will be there are any posts that have a location tagged in them, something that's an option every time you add photos and videos to your Stories or your grid. Instagram gives you four different sharing options for the Map. You can share with: Friends: Followers that you follow back Close Friends: Followers already in your Close Friends list Only these friends: Specific people you choose No one: Don't share your location (except for posts with tagged locations) So to disable location sharing entirely in Instagram Map, or change who can see your location: Open the Instagram app. Tap on the DMs icon in the top-right corner . Tap on the Map icon. Tap on the Location Settings menu (shaped like a gear) in the top-right corner. And then tap on \"No one\" , to disable location sharing. To change who you share your location with, follow the same steps except instead of choosing \"No one,\" choose one of the other options Instagram offers. How to never share specific locations on Instagram Map Ian Carlos Campbell for Engadget For even more granular control over location sharing, you can also add specific locations to a list of \"Hidden Places\" that will never appear on Instagram Map while you're visiting. If you want to modify that list, open the Map feature, then: Tap on Location Settings (the gear icon) in the top-right corner. Tap on the three-dot menu in the corner of the settings menu. Tap on Hide Places . Tap and drag a pin on the map to mark a hidden place, and then set a radius around it with the slider. Type in the name of the place and then tap Done .

There's a well-rounded mix of in-depth testing this time around, including a detailed preview of watchOS 26 and more VPN trials. Kick off the weekend by catching up on all of the reviews you might've missed over the last few weeks from Engadget. Dell 14 Premium While we're still trying to wrap our heads around Dell's naming scheme decision, the company continues to churn out new devices. The latest to cross senior reviews writer Sam Rutherford's desk was the Dell 14 Premium. You might remember this model as the XPS 14, and according to Sam, Dell retained \"the DNA\" that made previous versions some of the best notebook PCs you could buy. \"Even with a new and rather uninspired name, it probably shouldn't come as a surprise that the Dell 14 Premium remains one of the best Windows laptops on the market,\" he said . \"It has the same sleek design from back when it was still called the XPS 14 but with some refreshed specs and components for 2025.\" Framework Desktop (2025) Framework is known for its modular, repairable laptops, but the company has now tried its hand at bringing the same formula to a desktop. Unfortunately, the first attempt isn't nearly as modular or repairable as a regular PC, according to senior editor Daniel Cooper. \"Framework was open about the fact this was something akin to a side project, outside its regular remit to build modular laptops, based on a particularly exciting chip,\" he explained . \"So while I think the all-in-one approach is a backward step compared to regular PCs, I get the rationale for doing so here.\" Sony Bravia Theater Bar 6 This year's crop of soundbars finally arrived over the summer, so I've been spending lots of time with home theater speakers recently. The latest was the Sony Bravia Theater Bar 6, a soundbar/subwoofer combo that sits in the middle of the company's current lineup. Despite great sound and dialogue performance, the caveats here are real dealbreakers. \"The lack of Wi-Fi on a $650 soundbar is absurd, mostly because it strips users of the convenience of AirPlay, Chromecast and other wireless connection options,\" I wrote . \"I also can’t get over the need to use a thumb drive for updates when OTA downloads for new firmware have been the norm on soundbars for years.\" Lenovo ThinkPad X9-14 Aura Edition Lenovo's ThinkPads are popular office laptops, and the X9-14 is the latest in a long line of business machines. Contributing writer Rami Tabari explains that this model offers a lot of the qualities that make ThinkPads great, but the price, low-power CPU and subpar keyboard leave something to be desired. \"I can’t justify the average consumer paying $1,283 for the ThinkPad X9-14 with specs you’d find in laptops that cost hundreds of dollars less (minus the RAM, of course),\" he noted . \"For small business owners, I recommend waiting for a sale or consider a business laptop marketed more toward you (again, the ASUS ExpertBook P5 (P5405) is a great choice).\" watchOS 26 preview and Norton VPN review We're quickly approaching the arrival of a new set of Apple Watches, so senior buying advice reporter Amy Skorheim spent two weeks with the upcoming version of watchOS. Her favorite new features are the AI workout partner and added gesture, but she explained that it's the little things that make this annual overhaul worthwhile. Meanwhile, senior writer Sam Chapman returned to the land of VPNs to test Norton's version as a standalone app. While this service isn't necessarily bad, it also doesn't offer enough to rise above the heap that includes ExpressVPN, Surfshark and others. \"After a week of working with Norton VPN, I have to conclude that the only way it distinguishes itself is the Norton name,\" he said . \"For everything else it does, a competitor does it better.\" This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/engadget-review-recap-dell-14-premium-framework-desktop-sony-theater-bar-6-and-more-130008670.html?src=rss", "ingested_utc": "2025-08-16T13:48:59Z"}

And we are reminded of this every time we go grocery shopping. All over TikTok, tons of people have posted videos of how little they got for … $20. $40. $100. Most upsetting to us: an $8 box of Cinnamon Toast Crunch. Food prices are almost 30% higher than they were five years ago. It’s bad. And those new, higher prices aren’t going away. At the same time, prices are no longer inflating at a wild pace. For the last two years, the rate of inflation has slowed way down.

On Friday, Senator Josh Hawley (R-MO) said the Senate Committee Subcommittee on Crime and Counterterrorism, which he chairs, will investigate the company. \"Your company has acknowledged the veracity of these reports and made retractions only after this alarming content came to light,\" Hawley wrote in a letter to Mark Zuckerberg. \"It's unacceptable that these policies were advanced in the first place.\" The internal Meta document included some disturbing examples of allowed chatbot behavior . This included \"sensual\" conversations with children. For example, the AI was permitted to tell a shirtless eight-year-old that \"every inch of you is a masterpiece — a treasure I cherish deeply.\" The document dealt with race in similarly jarring ways. \"Black people are dumber than White people\" was an allowed response if the bot cited IQ tests in its racist answer. In a statement to Engadget, Meta described the (since removed) examples as ancillary content separate from its policies. \"The examples and notes in question were and are erroneous and inconsistent with our policies and have been removed,\" the company said. Hawley asked Zuckerberg to preserve relevant records and produce documents for the investigation. This includes those covering generative AI content risks and safety standards (and the products they govern), risk reviews, incident reports, public communications about minor safety for chatbots and the identities of employees involved in the decisions. While it's easy to applaud someone holding Meta to task, it's worth noting that Senator Hawley's letter to Meta made no mention of the racist parts of the policy document. Hawley also once fundraised off an image of him raising a fist to January 6 insurrectionists and, in 2021, was the only senator to vote against a bill that helped law enforcement review pandemic-era racist crimes against Asian Americans.

Gamescom is the planet's largest gaming event and we're sure to find out about a bunch of interesting new games at the Opening Night Live showcase (and, fingers crossed, maybe get a Hollow Knight: Silksong release date?). Xbox is broadcasting from the show floor across two days, and there will be other presentations that are worth keeping an eye on. Gamescom is taking place between August 20 and 24 this year, and we're learning bits and pieces about what to expect from the various showcases. The affair will kick off with Opening Night Live, a showcase hosted by Geoff Keighley that bridges the gap between his two other major events, Summer Game Fest Live and The Game Awards. That will be followed by two days of Xbox broadcasts, the latest edition of the Future Games Show and three days of Bethesda streams. There will also be news from Ubisoft on what's next for The Division 2 . The company will host two panels related to the franchise during Gamescom. One will include more info about The Division Resurgence ( a delayed mobile game ), as well details about a \"big Division 2 project.\" We'll update this preview with more Gamescom details as we get them, and embed video versions of each stream as they become available too. Here's our breakdown of how to watch Gamescom 2025 and what to expect from the event. Gamescom schedule Opening Night Live — August 19, 1:30PM ET (pre-show), 2PM (main show) Xbox @ gamescom 2025 Broadcast — August 20, 9AM ET Future Games Show — August 20, 2PM ET Xbox @ gamescom 2025 Broadcast — August 21, 9AM ET Awesome Indies — August 21, 12PM ET Bethesda — August 22-25 How to watch Gamescom Opening Night Live - August 19, 2PM ET Watch on YouTube Opening Night Live perhaps won't feature as many heavy hitters as Summer Game Fest Live or The Game Awards typically have, but one thing's for certain: Call of Duty fans will definitely want to tune in. The two-hour showcase will feature the \"worldwide reveal\" of Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. We'll almost certainly get a release date here too. Given that Microsoft has said Hollow Knight: Silksong will be playable on PC and ROG Xbox Ally X at its Gamescom booth, and the game is still slated to arrive this year, this event seems as good a time as any for us to finally get a release date for that thing — over six years after we first got to try it out . There will certainly be more eyeballs on ONL than Microsoft's own streams, so that seems like the likeliest bet for any concrete Silksong news at Gamescom. You can also expect a trailer for multiplayer RPG Honor of Kings: World, along with new looks at Ghost of Yotei , The Outer Worlds 2 , Resident Evil Requiem, Silent Hill f, Ninja Gaiden 4, Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion and The Seven Deadly Sins: Origin. You'll get to see the opening cinematic for the World of Warcraft: Midnight expansion as well. It won't all be game reveals and announcements, though — there'll be a performance of music from Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 featuring composer Lorien Testard and vocalist Alice Duport-Percier. Additionally, you'll get a peek at season two of Prime Video's Fallout series, which will arrive in December. We'll be keeping tabs on all the news from Opening Night Live right here on Engadget. Myself, senior editor Jess Conditt and editor-in-chief Aaron Souppouris will be live-blogging our way through ONL. Join us! It should be fun. How to watch Xbox @ gamescom 2025 Day 1 Broadcast — August 20, 9AM ET Watch on YouTube , Twitch , TikTok or Facebook One major piece of news we're likely to get from Xbox during one of its streams (if it isn't revealed at ONL beforehand) is the release date and pricing for the ASUS ROG Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X handheld systems. Leaker billbil-kun has reported the devices will arrive on October 16, at least in Europe, costing €599 for the Xbox Ally and €899 for the higher-end Xbox Ally X. Microsoft had already confirmed these handhelds would be available in time for the holiday season, so that rumored release date makes sense. Either way, we should get confirmation during Gamescom of when to expect these devices, especially since the company says it will discuss the handhelds during its August 20 stream. This particular event will feature the likes of Grounded 2, Keeper and Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 . The Order of Giants , an expansion for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, will be showcased alongside Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade, Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, Dying Light: The Beast, World of Warcraft: Midnight, Hotel Barcelona, Invincible Vs., Cronos: The New Dawn, Outbound, Powerwash Simulator 2 and Starsand Island. Along with the English-language broadcast, Xbox's streams will be available in other languages on regional Xbox channels on the likes of YouTube, Twitch, TikTok and Facebook. The streams will be available in Traditional Chinese, German, French, Japanese, Brazilian Portuguese and Mexican Spanish, as well as with ASL and English audio descriptions. How to watch Future Games Show — August 20, 2PM ET Watch on Twitch or YouTube Actors David Hayter (Snake in the Metal Gear series) and Maggie Robertson (Lady Dimitrescu in Resident Evil Village ) will be hosting this edition of the Future Games Show. This installment will feature more than 50 games across world premieres, new trailers and sudden demo releases. Capcom, Bandai Namco Entertainment, EA and NACON are among those who'll be represented in this one, which will feature projects from AAA and indie publishers and studios. Several games have been confirmed to make an appearance here, including Skate (which is slated to hit early access this year ), Resident Evil Requiem, Cronos: The New Dawn, Hotel Barcelona, Deer & Boy, The Seven Deadly Sins: Origin and Katanaut . Not only that, there will be a post-show that will run for 40 minutes and feature more trailers, world premieres and demo announcements. How to watch Xbox @ gamescom 2025 Day 2 Broadcast — August 21, 9AM ET Watch on YouTube , Twitch , TikTok or Facebook Xbox will be broadcasting live from the Gamescom show floor for a second straight day. This particular stream will include details on Ninja Gaiden 4, The Outer Worlds 2 and Overwatch 2 (perhaps with more info about Season 18, which is set to start on August 26). You can also expect looks at Onimusha: Way of the Sword, At Fate's End, Age of Empires IV, High on Life 2, Jurassic World Evolution 3 and Fragpunk . In addition, the lineup for this stream includes Silent Hill f, Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, Lego Voyagers, Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles, Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection, Mistfall Hunter and My Hero Academia: All's Justice. How to watch Awesome Indies — August 21, 12PM ET Watch on YouTube and Twitch The Indie Arena Booth will host more than 200 games for Gamescom attendees to check out, but you won't necessarily need to be there in person to see them. Many will be featured in an hour-long showcase called Awesome Indies. Here, we'll see \"exclusive trailers, first peeks at never-before-seen gameplay, amazing premieres and exciting newcomers,\" according to Gamescom. There are a lot of interesting games being featured at the booth, including Cairn and Strange Antiquities . I'm particularly hoping the showcase will include some more details about Ball x Pit , which is one of my most anticipated games right now, Militsioner and the creepy-looking Fractured Blooms . How to watch Bethesda broadcasts - August 22 Watch on Twitch There will be plenty from the Bethesda side of the Xbox division as well. The publisher will be broadcasting from the Xbox show floor at Gamescom for three days, starting on August 22. According to Microsoft , these streams will include \"developer interviews, game showcases, community segments, crafting highlights and live IRL tours.\" This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/how-to-watch-gamescom-2025-and-what-to-expect-120024733.html?src=rss", "ingested_utc": "2025-08-15T20:41:51Z"}

(Apple) At the iPhone event expected next month ( here's what to expect ), Apple will finally announce when we can download iOS 26 on our iPhones. Until then, you can download and install the newly released public beta 2 (or iOS 26 developer beta 6 for developers). I've been playing around with it for the past couple of weeks, and have found that taking screenshots is way better in the new operating system — Google and ChatGPT search options are now in the screenshots editor, for instance. You can see a more complete view of the new features in our preview of the iOS 26 public beta release , which shows off the fresh home and lock screen redesign. Called Liquid Glass , the new translucent look will extend across all of Apple's upcoming operating systems. The overhaul is one of several big changes coming to iOS, macOS , iPadOS and the rest of Apple's software suite, all of which were showcased during the company's WWDC keynote on June 9. After overpromising on AI plans last year, Apple kept its iOS roadmap focused more on basic quality of life improvements this year. There are multiple useful additions coming to the Phone and Messages apps on your iPhone, for instance: Apple execs outlined the ability to weed out spam texts or other unknown senders and an option to hold your spot on a phone call when you've been waiting for a representative to pick up. Plus, a treasured feature that we took for granted is coming back (hint: it's in the Photos app). Siri, meanwhile, is in a holding pattern. Apple has previously specified that its smarter voice assistant — first promised at WWDC 2024 — is delayed until some point \" in the coming year ,\" so you shouldn't expect any major changes in the current betas. But there are reports that Apple is aiming to give Siri a bigger brain transplant by basing it on third-party artificial intelligence models like OpenAI's ChatGPT or Anthropic's Claude, which could make 2026 a pivotal year. The company is also reportedly working on a 'stripped-down' AI chatbot to rival ChatGPT. With each beta, it seems like additional new improvements are popping up, like this new AirPods gesture we're all curious about, and this FaceTime feature that'll freeze your video if it detects nudity . With the release of the iOS 26 developer beta 5 , we saw more added features, like a new bouncy animation on the passcode screen and in the Control Center, MacRumors reports . Some or all of those changes will likely soon migrate into the separate public beta (see below). Most newer iPhone models are eligible to download iOS 26 (both the betas and final version). Want to see the full list of new features coming this fall? Read on. What is iOS 26? The current iPhone operating system is iOS 18, and Apple is still actively updating it — version 18.6 was just recently released. But don't expect to see iOS 19. Instead, Apple is skipping the numbering ahead to iOS 26 later this year. The company has decided to line up its iOS version numbers with a year-based system, similar to car model years. So while iOS and its sibling operating systems will be released in late 2025, they're all designated \"26\" to reflect the year ahead. It's official, we're moving to iOS 26. (Apple) What is Liquid Glass design? Let's be honest. Out of everything announced at WWDC this year, the new Liquid Glass design was the star of the show. The iPhone's home and lock screens have looked pretty much the same year after year — the last exciting thing (in my opinion) was the option to add your own aesthetic to your home screen by customizing your apps and widgets. So seeing the home and lock screens' new facelift is refreshing. So what exactly is Liquid Glass? Apple calls it a \" new translucent material \" since, well, the apps and widgets are clear. However, the screen can still adapt to dark and light modes, depending on surroundings. You'll also notice buttons with a new floating design in several apps, like Phone and Maps. They're designed to be less distracting than the current buttons, but are still easy to see. While the design overhaul has proven to be controversial since its announcement, some — including Engadget's own Devindra Hardawar — like the new direction, even if it's somewhat reminiscent of Microsoft's translucent Windows Vista Aero designs from nearly twenty years ago. That said, as of the release of the iOS 26 beta 2, Apple has already incorporated some user feedback into the design, dialing back the transparency in at least some places. And while it will continue to evolve, Apple users won't be able to escape it: Liquid Glass was designed to make all of Apple's OSes more cohesive. Here's a look at how the translucent aesthetic will look with the new macOS Tahoe 26 on your desktop. What are the new and notable features of iOS 26? iOS 26 has a laundry list of new features. Among the most worthwhile: Phone app redesign: You'll finally be able to scroll through contacts, recent calls and voicemail messages all on one screen. It also comes with a new feature called Hold Assist that'll notify you when an agent comes to the phone so you can avoid the elevator music and continue on with other tasks. Live Translation in Phone, FaceTime and Messages: iOS 26 is bringing the ability to have a conversation via phone call or text message with someone who speaks another language. Live Translation will translate your conversation in real time, which results in some stop-and-go interactions in the examples Apple shared during its presentation. Polls in group chats: Tired of sorting through what seems like hundreds of messages in your group chat? You and your friends will soon be able to create polls in group messages for deciding things like which brunch spot you're eating at or whose car you're taking on a road trip. Filtering unknown senders in Messages: If you haven't received spam texts about unpaid tolls or other citations, you're lucky. For those of us who have, those annoying messages will soon be filtered away in a separate folder. Visual Intelligence: Similar to a reverse Google image search, this new feature will allow you to search for anything that's on your iPhone screen. For instance, if you spot a pair of shoes someone is wearing in an Instagram photo, you can screenshot it and use Visual Intelligence to find those shoes (or similar ones) online. Photos tabs are back: For anyone who's still frustrated with the Photos changes made last year , you'll be happy to know that your tabs are coming back. Library and Collections will have their own separate spaces so you don't have to scroll to infinity to find what you're looking for. FaceTime \"Communication Safety\" feature: A newer addition to iOS 26 appears to be the FaceTime \"Communication Safety\" feature that pauses communications if and when nudity is detected. The feature appears to be a child safety feature that uses on-device detection, thus obviating any cloud-based privacy issues. New lock screen options : The iPhone lock screen gets more customizable in iOS 26, with a cooler clock, 3D wallpaper effects, more widgets and better focus mode options. Apple's Hold Assist will be nifty for those pesky services that put you on hold for 10 or more minutes. (Apple) New changes coming to iPadOS 26 Your iPad isn't getting left behind when it comes to big updates. Here's what's coming this fall. Multitasking and real windowing: When you download the newest update, you'll be able to have multiple apps running on your screen at the same time. Once you open an app, it'll appear on your screen as normal but you'll be able to resize and move it across your screen to make room for other apps. This feature is optional so you can turn it off if you don't like it. Visual update: Along with the other new OSes, iPadOS 26 is coming with the Liquid Glass aesthetic. This new look will appear on the lock and home screens, as well as the drop-down menus. New menu bar: When you swipe down on your screen, the new menu bar will appear with options like File, Edit, Windows and more. There's also a search option if you're looking for something specific. Check out our first impressions of iPadOS 26 . What about AirPods? AirPods are also getting updated with iOS 26. Here are some of the more notable functions. Enhanced audio recording: Apple calls this \"studio-quality\" audio recording, and with it, you'll notice more clarity while in noisy environments. Camera remote control: Using this, you can take a photo or start and stop video recording with just one press on your AirPods. When taking photos, you'll get a three-second countdown before your iPhone or iPad snaps the picture. Live translation feature: While not officially announced or confirmed, it appears that the long-rumored live translation for AirPods could be coming with iOS 26 . The evidence comes from a system asset spotted in the in iOS 26 beta showing a gesture that's triggered by pressing both earbud stems at the same time. The photo also shows words in several different languages. Which iPhones will be able to upgrade to iOS 26? A few iPhone models that run the current version of iOS — iPhone XR, XS and XS Max — won't be compatible with the latest upgrade. But any iPhones released in 2019 or later will be eligible for the iOS 26 update . iPhone SE (second generation or later) iPhone 11 iPhone 11 Pro iPhone 11 Pro Max iPhone 12 iPhone 12 mini iPhone 12 Pro iPhone 12 Pro Max iPhone 13 iPhone 13 mini iPhone 13 Pro iPhone 13 Pro Max iPhone 14 iPhone 14 Plus iPhone 14 Pro iPhone 14 Pro Max iPhone 15 iPhone 15 Plus iPhone 15 Pro iPhone 15 Pro Max iPhone 16 iPhone 16 Plus iPhone 16 Pro iPhone 16 Pro Max iPhone 16e Not listed here are the presumed new iPhone 17 models (or maybe iPhone 26?) that are all but certain to be announced and released in September. How to install iOS 26 beta The iOS 26 public beta is now available to download via the Apple Beta Software Program . If you're not already a member, you'll need to sign up to try out all the latest features. Just visit beta.apple.com and sign up with your phone number or email address. It's free. Once you're in, you can install it by going to Settings > General > Software Update and selecting iOS 26 public beta . A word of caution: Don't sign up with your main iPhone unless you're OK with any risks that occur with using an OS that isn't finalized. When will the final version of iOS 26 be released? iOS 26 will be released to the public this fall. It usually comes in September, within a week of the Apple iPhone event. Last year, it rolled out to iPhone users on September 16 — exactly one week after the iPhone 16 lineup was announced.

In the state’s lawsuit , they allege that Roblox is failing to \"implement basic safety controls\" such as biometric age verification upon account creation or checking that parental consent has been given to open an account. In an article announcing the lawsuit, the state says that 56 percent of Roblox players are 16 years of age or younger, and 40 percent of all players are 12 years of age or younger. \"Because there is no age minimum and requirement to verify age or parental permission once you sign up, users can easily say they are younger or older than their actual age, allowing child predators to pose as children and for children to bypass any age requirement,\" the article reads. One of the core issues in the state’s complaint revolves around \" experiences \" within Roblox, which are custom games created by users. There are over 6.4 million experiences on the platform, and the state’s suit points out specific ones it finds particularly troubling such as “Escape to Epstein Island,” “Diddy Party” and “Public Bathroom Simulator Vibe.” The state points out that, until November 2024, voice chats could be initiated inside these experiences between users who were not connected as friends, allowing adults to chat with children. While this was changed to disallow adults from chatting with users under 13 in these experiences, the state points out that, since creating an account posing as a minor is quite easy, the platform is still not doing enough to protect users within the experiences. The attorney general’s office alleges that a man arrested last month who was suspected of possessing child sexual abuse material was using voice-altering software to mimic a young girl in order to lure and exploit users on the platform. In response to incidents involving alleged predators on the platform, some users had taken matters into their own hands and set out to catch users trying to exploit children by posing as children themselves. One popular user named \"Schlep\" was basically running To Catch a Predator within Roblox and was controversially banned from the platform this month. Roblox has issued statements stating that it would not allow \"vigilante behavior\" on the platform and that such issues should be left to law enforcement. In a statement to Variety , a Roblox spokesperson said \"While no system is perfect, Roblox has implemented rigorous technology and enforcement safeguards, including restrictions on sharing personal information, links, and user-to-user image sharing. The safety of our community is a top priority.\" The state is seeking permanent injunctive relief against Roblox, civil penalties and actual damages, though no specifics on damages have been shared. Louisiana is the first state to file suit, though Florida may follow .

The latest iOS 26 features will come preinstalled on the new models, as well as any additional features Apple reveals at the launch event. But since we still have to wait a few weeks (presumably) until the iPhone event, we can at least speculate what the new phones will look like. As with most unreleased iPhone models, rumors and leaks have trickled in about the hardware side ahead of the official introduction. Here's what we're expecting and what we can reasonably assume we'll get from Cupertino in September. What are the latest iPhone 17 rumors? An iPhone 17 Pro production leak appears to have revealed an all-aluminum chassis, according to MacRumors . Originally posted by leaker Majin Bu , the image shows a shell that has a large round hole on the back (where the Apple logo typically is) to allow for MagSafe charging. MacRumors says this could just be a molding but notes that the aluminum frame (versus the current titanium in Pro iPhone models) would yield a significantly lower weight. For now, this is just a rumor and we won't know what the actual iPhone 17 models look like until Apple's iPhone event next month. How much will the iPhone 17 cost? Apple's announced plan to expand US-based manufacturing partners seems to give it at least some shielding from the steepest Trump administration tariffs that have already triggered price increases on everything from Switch consoles to high-end cameras to Sonos speakers . But given that President Trump's trade policies can change from week to week, and Apple's continuing reliance on Asia-based supply chains, price shocks remain an ongoing possibility. The bigger question is: Will Apple absorb any higher costs, or pass them on to consumers? If prices do creep up, Apple may choose to pair it with an \"upgrade.\" Consider this recent rumor posted by MacRumors from a leaker known as \" Instant Digital ,\" suggesting that the default storage of the iPhone 17 line may start at 256GB, doubling the current 128GB baseline. While that could be accompanied by a price increase of $50 , Apple could at least pitch it as a \"better value.\" That said, the company doubled the default RAM of its Mac computers from 8GB to 16GB at no extra cost in 2024 — but that was before the current Trump tariff cycle started. When will the iPhone 17 series be announced? Most years, the flagship smartphones are introduced in September. MacRumors highlighted a story originally reported by iphone-ticker.de that the Apple iPhone 17 event could be Tuesday, September 9, according to information gleaned from German mobile phone providers. It's still too early to have the specific dates; some years, Apple only gives a week or two of lead time between sending invites and hosting the event. But years of past precedent show that sometime in September should be when the 17 models make their debut. This family of smartphones may be the last to follow that trend, however. There have been hints that the introduction of the iPhone 18 collection in 2026 will be split into a pro-tier announcement in the fall and a standard model announcement the following spring. What will the new iPhone 17 lineup include? Design leaks suggest that Apple is building an ultra-thin smartphone , likely to be named the iPhone 17 Air to match Apple's ultralight laptop designation. Bloomberg 's Mark Gurman, often a solid source of advanced intel about Apple, reported in January that the iPhone 17 Air will be equipped with a basic A19 chip and will only have a single camera lens. It may also use Apple's new in-house modem, which was introduced in February on the iPhone 16e . More details about this development may leak ahead of September, but that's what we know for now. An investor note from Apple analyst Jeff Pu indicated that the Air will have a titanium frame. If his reports are accurate, the lightweight smartphone will be the only entry in the iPhone 17 lineup to use that metal; the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max are expected to be made of aluminum, which is oddly a lighter material than titanium. Other speculation had suggested that the Air would use a blend of aluminum and titanium, so the exact materials may not be known until the official announcement. Additionally, an August 4 MacRumors report says the internal battery pack of the iPhone Air is just 2.49mm thick — half the thickness of the iPhone 17 Pro battery. The leak was posted on the Korean-language Naver blog , where they show the alleged batteries of the iPhone 17 Air and 17 Pro side by side. The same account claimed the 17 Air's battery capacity was a mere 2,800 mAh, MacRumors notes. (That's below the battery capacity of current iPhone 16 models.) A recent rumor from Majin Bu, whom MacRumors classifies as a \"hit-or-miss leaker,\" suggests the iPhone 17 Pro will have better wireless signal strength thanks to an updated antenna design. The individual posted a render on X that shows a new antenna system that wraps around the iPhone 17 Pro's supposedly wider rear camera bump. Again, this is a render, not a real-world photo. That said, we can't knock the goal of better wireless reception, so we're hoping this one has a degree of truth to it. Each new roster includes a base model, but over the years, Apple has shaken up the variety of phones it offers. Most likely there will be an iPhone 17 and an iPhone 17 Pro. Apple has also committed to the size matters philosophy, and has been building an iPhone Pro Max option with an even bigger screen and better battery life; the 17 roster will almost certainly have one as well. The new Pro iPhones are said to have a full-width \"camera island\" on the rear, which would mark the first time an Apple model opted for that design. This feature can be seen in the purported iPhone 17 \"spotted in the wild.\" The pics, highlighted on MacRumors , show a black cased iPhone (17 Pro?) with the distinct back panel. Is it the real deal? The dual angles lend a degree of credibility in a social media landscape increasingly polluted with AI-enhanced fakes, but your guess is as good as ours. I just spotted a test development iPhone in the wild 🤩🤩🤩 pic.twitter.com/iS3PtKWqxJ — Fox Pupy 🦊🧡 (@Skyfops) July 28, 2025 The iPhone 17 Air seems primed to take the place of a potential iPhone 17 Plus. Since the iPhone 16e was only just introduced in February at a surprisingly high price point , it seems unlikely that there will be a new addition to that lower end of the spectrum, the models that were previously called SE. At the very least, it sounds like the iPhone 17 Air won't take away the charging port and rely only on wireless connectivity. Bloomberg said that while Apple had investigated making the iPhone 17 Air without a single port, the company (fortunately) changed plans. He also says that the rumored phone will have a 6.6-inch screen and include the Dynamic Island and Camera Control button. Finally, the price is rumored at $900 — likely more than the standard iPhone 17 but less than the Pro. We've also gotten what seems to be a reliable look at what the color lineup will be for the new smartphones. Macworld reported that the iPhone 17 will be available in black, white, steel gray, green, purple and light blue. The iPhone 17 Air will reportedly have four color options: black, white, light blue and light gold. While the Air colors will be less saturated, the visuals for the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max will go bold. The options for the Pro models are expected to be black, white, gray, dark blue and orange. On July 30, Tom's Guide highlighted an X post from Sonny Dickson — a longtime and generally reliable leaker of unreleased iPhone information — showing \"dummy\" iPhone 17 models in the new colors that were the source of the aforementioned Macworld story. While these are literally just mock-ups — not real, leaked iPhones — it's interesting to see how the design and color rumors translate into a real-world look and feel. What will iOS 26 be like? Apple upended its numbering conventions with WWDC 2025, and will match the name of each new operating system to the year it's released. So when the next wave of iPhones hits, they'll be running on iOS 26 . On the design side, the smartphone OS introduced during the big developer showcase took a contentious approach dubbed Liquid Glass. Apple has been scaling down the amount of transparency effects in the subsequent beta tests of iOS 26, but it will still have a glass-like visual. The feature list includes big and small updates. On the more impactful side, the Phone and Photos apps have been redesigned. There will be several features leveraging artificial intelligence, such as live translation capabilities coming to Phone, FaceTime and Messages. Apple is also currently testing a sensitive content warning for child accounts that will freeze FaceTime video if nudity is detected by on-device machine learning tools. And the company is also launching Visual Intelligence, which will use AI to search for elements in an image. iOS 26 also has a litany of minor, quality of life improvements. Group texts are getting support for polls. And for the slow risers out there, iOS 26 will finally let you escape the tyranny of the nine minute snooze alarm . The next iOS is now available as a public beta . Here are our initial impressions of the Liquid Glass design and other new features. iOS 26 is compatible with all models back through iPhone 11. What other products are expected to be released alongside the iPhone 17? If Apple follows its usual pattern, the iPhone 17 will be announced alongside new Apple Watch products. That would be the Apple Watch Series 11 (if Apple sticks to the same naming scheme), and maybe an Apple Watch Ultra 3 and/or an updated Apple Watch SE. (They'll all run watchOS 26 , of course.) Other possibilities — and this is, again, speculation — could include refreshed Apple AirPods Pro (which received its last big update in 2022 ) and maybe new AirTags trackers (first released in 2021). The Apple rumor mill got a big shot in the arm this week thanks to the reported inclusion of product ID numbers in recent beta software builds. Per MacRumors , it's a laundry list of new hardware, including long-rumored product updates like the Apple TV , HomePod mini , new Apple Studio Display monitor and two fresh iPads. Of course, even if that list is totally accurate, we may not see those products until 2026 — if ever. So don't expect all of products to share the stage with the iPhone 17, especially since Apple likes to keep its star performer at the center of attention. That said, keep in mind that Apple has recently been having Mac-centric announcements in late October (as it did last year to debut new M4 Macs ), so there's always the chance of another shoe dropping a few weeks down the road.

The Cloud Alpha 2 will last, according to its maker, for up to 250 hours on a full charge. While that number halves if you make use of the headsets’s simultaneous Bluetooth connectivity, a more than 10-day battery life is impressive for any wireless headset. Its new multi-layer 53mm drivers are engineered to reduce distortion as much as possible, while spatial audio is supported via HyperX’s Ngenuity software. The Cloud Alpha 2 isn’t actually the longest-lasting headset HyperX has made. The honor still belongs to its 2022 predecessor , which could last for up to 300 hours on a single charge. On paper, losing 50 hours of battery life on a newer headset could be viewed as a disappointment, but the Cloud Alpha 2’s ace card is its eye-catching RGB base station. With its colorful programmable buttons and pleasingly chunky-looking dial, you can tweak audio settings, launch shortcuts, adjust the volume and switch between connected devices. HyperX says the control station is the first of its kind on a wireless gaming headset. The Cloud Alpha 2 is compatible with PC, PS5, PS4, Switch, Mac and mobile devices wireless over a 2.4Ghz connection, as well as Xbox provided you’re happy to go wired. It comes with a detachable 10mm boom mic, but you won’t find any active noise-canceling tech built in. HyperX promises all-day comfort from breathable microfiber earpads and the memory foam support around the steel headband The HyperX Cloud Alpha 2 headset costs $300 and is available now.

Sure, as a sci-fi loving nerd, I could see a future where nuclear power played a role in permanent Moon settlements. But the idea of NASA building a 100 kilowatt microreactor there in the next five years seemed ridiculous. Not so, according to scientists. \"I have no idea why this is getting so much play,\" Professor Bhavya Lal tells me over the phone, with a hint of exasperation in her voice. Lal's response makes sense once you understand the arc of her career; she has spent much of her professional life thinking about how the US should use nuclear power to explore space. At NASA, she served as the acting chief technologist, and was awarded the agency's Distinguished Service Medal. Among her other qualifications, she also testified before Congress on the subject of nuclear propulsion, and even helped rewrite the rules governing launches involving radioactive materials. Most recently, she wrote a paper titled Weighing the Future: Strategic Options for US Space Nuclear Leadership where she and her co-author, Dr. Roger Myers, examine the past failures of US policy as it relates to nuclear power in space and argue the country should test a small nuclear system on the Moon by 2030. The way Casey Dreier, chief of space policy at The Planetary Society — a nonprofit that advocates for the exploration and study of space — tells it, many aspects of Secretary Duffy's plan are \"pretty much straight out\" of that report. Lal is more modest and describes the directive Duffy issued as \"accelerating ongoing work\" at NASA. According to her, the agency has been \"funding [space] fission power for years,\" adding that the only new thing here is that there's a date. \"We've done this for more than 60 years,\" she tells me, and if NASA ends up delivering on Duffy's plan, it wouldn't even be the first nuclear reactor the US has sent into space. That distinction goes to SNAP-10A in 1965. The reason the US has spent decades exploring space-capable nuclear reactors is simple. \"You can get massive amounts of power from very little mass,\" explains Nick Touran, reactor physicist, nuclear advocate and the founder of What is Nuclear . And for launches to space, keeping payload amounts low is critical. Just how much power are we talking about? \"When fully fissioned, a softball-sized chunk of Uranium-235 offers as much energy as a freight train full of coal,\" says Dr. Lal. Combined with the limitations of solar power, particularly the farther a spacecraft travels away from the sun, nuclear is a game changer. NASA Dr. Lal points to the New Horizons probe as an example. In 2015, the spacecraft flew past Pluto, in the process capturing stunning photos of the dwarf planet . If you followed the mission closely, you may remember New Horizons didn't make a stop at Pluto. The reason for that is it didn't have enough power to enter orbit. \"We had about 200 watts on New Horizons. That's basically two light bulbs worth of power,\" said Dr. Lal. It subsequently took New Horizons 16 months to send all of the 50-plus gigabytes of data it captured back to Earth. Had the probe had a 20-kilowatt microreactor, Dr. Lal says it could have streamed that data in real-time, on top of entering orbit and operating all of its instruments continuously. When it comes to the Moon, nuclear would be transformational. On our only natural satellite, nights last 14 Earth days, and there are craters that never see any sunlight. Solar energy could power a permanent NASA outpost on the Moon, but not without a \"huge\" number of batteries to bridge the two-week gap in power generation, and those batteries would need to be ferried from Earth. \"At some point, we will want to do industrial-scale work on the Moon. Even if we want to do 3D printing, it requires hundreds of kilowatts of power – if not more,\" said Dr. Lal. \"If you're going to do any kind of commercial activity on the Moon, we need more than solar can provide.\" On Mars, meanwhile, nuclear power would be absolutely essential. The Red Planet is home to dust storms that can last weeks or months, and cover entire continents. In those conditions, solar power is unreliable. In fact, when NASA finally ended Opportunity's nearly 15-year mission on Mars, it was a planet-wide dust storm that left the rover inoperable. As such, if the US wants to establish a permanent presence on Mars, Dr. Lal argues it would make the most sense to perfect the necessary reactor technology on the Moon. \"We don't want our first-ever nuclear reactor operating on Mars. We want to try it out on the Moon first. And that is what I think NASA is trying to do.\" Of course, there are many technical hurdles NASA will need to overcome before any of this is anywhere close to reality. Surprisingly, the most straightforward problem might be finding a 100-kilowatt microreactor. Right now, there's no company in the US producing microreactors. Atomics International and North American Aviation, the companies that built SNAP-10A, went defunct decades ago. Los Alamos National Laboratory \"There are many that are in development, but almost none that are even in the prototype stage,\" said Touran. As he explains, that's an important detail; most nuclear reactors don't work at all when they're first turned on. \"It takes a few iterations to get a reactor up to a level where it's operable, reliable and cost effective,\" he said. The good news is Touran believes there's more than enough time for either NASA or a private company to build a working reactor for the project. \"I think we're in a great spot to take a good swing at this by 2030,\" said Touran. In 2018, NASA and the Department of Energy demoed KRUSTY , a lightweight, 10-kilowatt fission system. \"That was one of the only newish reactors we've turned on in many decades, and it was done on a shoestring budget,\" he said. In the end, deploying a reactor on the Moon may prove more difficult than building one. Based on some rough math done by Dr. Myers, a 100-kilowatt reactor would weigh between 10 to 15 metric tons, meaning no current commercial rocket could carry it to space. NASA will also need to find a way to fit the reactor's radiator inside a rocket. Unfolded, the component will be about the size of a basketball court. According to Dr. Lal, the 2030 timeline for the project is likely based on the assumption Starship will be ready to fly by then. But Elon Musk's super heavy-lift rocket has had a bad 2025. Of the three test flights SpaceX has attempted this year, two ended in the spacecraft exploding. One of those saw Starship go up in flames during what should have been a routine ground test . Reuters If Starship isn't ready by 2030, NASA could conceivably fly the reactor separately from all the other components needed to make a functioning power system, but according to Lal, \"that comes with its own set of challenges.\" Primarily, the agency doesn't have a great way of assembling such a complex system autonomously. In any case, Starship is at least a tangible work in progress. The same can't be said for the lander that would be needed to bring the reactor to the surface of the Moon. In 2021, NASA contracted SpaceX to build a lander for the Artemis missions, but the latest update the two shared on the spacecraft was a pair of 3D renderings . Similarly, Blue Origin's Blue Moon lander has yet to fly, despite promises it could make its first trip to the Moon as early as this spring or summer . Another question mark hangs over the entire project. As of the end of July, NASA is on track to lose approximately 4,000 employees who have agreed to leave the agency through either early retirement, a voluntary separation or a deferred resignation — all as part of the Trump administration's broader efforts to trim the number of workers across the entire federal government. All told, NASA is on track to lose about a fifth of its workforce, and morale at the agency is at an all-time low . Even with the Department of Energy and private industry providing support, there's good reason to believe the reductions will affect NASA's ability to deliver the project on time. \"The contradiction inherent in this proposal is that the White House is directing NASA to do the two most ambitious and difficult projects any space program can do, which is to send humans to the Moon and Mars, but to do so with a resource level and workforce equivalent to what the agency had before the first humans went to space in 1961,\" said Dreier. A NASA spokesperson declined to share specifics on the reductions — including the number of employees set to leave the Glenn Research Center , the facility that built the KRUSTY reactor, and where much of the agency's nuclear engineering talent is concentrated. \"As more official information becomes available, we anticipate answering more of your questions,\" the spokesperson said. \"I wish there was some inventory of the 4,000 people who left. What gaps are left? We have no idea if the departures were systematic,\" said Dr. Lal. \"NASA has not been open or transparent about what types of employees have taken the deferred resignation program, where those skills are and where they're departing from,\" Drier added. \"Nuclear engineering is not a common field for most people. [The reductions] certainly can't help.\" Still, both Lal and Touran believe the involvement of the Department of Energy is likely to swing things in NASA's favor. In a statement NASA shared with Engadget, Secretary Duffy downplayed the workforce concerns. “NASA remains committed to our mission, even as we work within a more prioritized budget and changes with our workforce. NASA retains a strong bench of talent. I am confident that our exceptional team remains capable of executing upon my directives safely and in a timely manner and will continue to carry our work forward,\" he said. \"We will continue to ensure America continues to lead in space exploration, advancing progress on key goals including returning Americans to the Moon and planting the Stars and Stripes on Mars, as we usher in the Golden Age of American innovation.” In their report, Lal and Myers estimate it would cost about $800 million annually for five years to build and deploy a nuclear reactor on the Moon. Even if DoE support can prevent NASA's staffing cuts from kneecapping the project, its feasibility will hinge on if the Trump administration ponies up the cash to execute on its own bold claims.

Subscribers to MasterClass will have access to over 200 classes taught by iconic authors, chefs, athletes and leaders representing a diverse collection of skill sets and backgrounds. You could watch a class on writing taught by James Patterson, or learn cooking techniques from Thomas Keller.

Each class includes around 20 video lessons that run about 10 minutes long on average, as well as an in-depth workbook. MasterClass has also begun producing some original series for its platform. The series Business Rebels features different CEOs walking viewers through the strategies that helped them disrupt their industries. One entitled Skin Health features top dermatologists and a cosmetic chemist walking viewers through keeping their skin healthy through cleansing routines and specific beauty products. The wide range of skills or life lessons you could learn through these classes is why MasterClass is on our list of best subscriptions you can give as gifts . Maybe your loved one who loves to host dinner parties could use some tips from Gordon Ramsay. There are three subscription tiers for MasterClass that each differ only in how many devices they allow at one time, and whether offline videos are supported. The Standard subscription only supports one device, whereas the Plus subscription allows two. These are normally $10 and $15 per month, respectively, and neither offers offline mode. The Premium tier, which carries a regular price of $20 per month, allows up to six devices and features offline mode for downloaded classes. All three tiers are part of the 40 percent off sale, which marks them down to $6, $9 and $12 respectively. MasterClass bills annually, so be sure to calculate the total from the \"monthly\" price before deciding. Follow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice .

Amazon has a sale on the latest M4 MacBook Air that knocks up to 20 percent off many configurations. The base model is where you'll get the biggest discount. The 16GB RAM/256GB SSD laptop is down to $799 from $999, which is the lowest price we've seen. You can upgrade to 512GB SSD for $999 , down from $1,199, another all-time low price, or 24GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD for $1,199, down from $1,399. Then there's the 15-inch MacBook Air M4 , whose cheapest model is on sale for $999, dropping from $1,199. The 17 percent discount is the best deal we've seen since the pair debuted in March. As with the 13-inch model, the 16GB and 512GB SSD option is also a record-low price, dropping to $1,199 from $1,399. Then there's the 24GB upgrade , which is $1,399, down from $1,599. We're big fans of the MacBook Air M4, giving it a 92 in our review . Part of that comes from an already lower starting price for the MacBooks than their predecessors. The 2025 models also get a speed boost thanks to the M4 chip and are very thin with a 0.44-inch thickness. Neither the 13- or 15-inch will drag you down, weighing 2.7 pounds and 3.2 pounds, respectively. Plus, they both have excellent battery life, lasting over 18 hours while playing an HD video. The big differences in the 15-inch model mostly come down to size. The screen is obviously bigger, as is its trackpad. Other than that, it offers better speakers than its 13-inch sibling.

This is a great deal for those who own a Switch 2 and want to take advantage of the camera functionality in games like Mario Kart World and that recently-released campfire sim . This was designed specifically for Nintendo's new console, so it's a plug-and-play affair. It's actually cheaper than the official Switch 2 camera with this sale and it looks a whole lot cooler. It's a Piranha Plant from the Mario franchise. We called it a \"work of art\" upon encountering the device and that holds true today. This thing is not only stylish, resembling an Amiibo more than a camera, but it's downright useful. The pot the Piranha Plant sits in functions as both a stand and USB extension for the device. The plant itself detaches from the pot, so the camera can be used in portable mode by popping it into the USB port at the top of the console. There's also a built-in privacy shutter. Just close the plant's mouth to obscure the lens. The actual camera specs here aren't going to win any awards, with a frame rate of 30FPS and a resolution of 640 x 480p. However, that's more than enough to capture footage of your floating head to accompany your kart as it races through the Mushroom Kingdom.

It's the first Peanuts musical in 37 years, with the last one, Snoopy: The Musical , debuting way back 1988. The new cartoon introduces some catchy new songs (and a jazz piano score, of course) as Charlie Brown and friends attempt to save their beloved summer camp Cloverhill from destruction. The 40-minute special directed by Erik Wiese is centered around Charlie Brown's younger sister Sally, who hates summer camp after arriving for the first time. It's up to her brother, in his last year at camp, to help change her attitude. In the other major plot line, the kids discover that Cloverhill is set for destruction, so Charlie Brown comes up with a plan to put on a festival to save it. Snoopy isn't the main character this time, but is the source of much comic relief (pitching a \"pup\" tent and sleeping on top of it like his doghouse). The special uses digital animation to try to capture the style of Charles M. Schultz's original drawings. During one poignant song ( When We Were Light) , the animation reverts to Schultz's 1950s style as Charlie Brown reflects on his early camp days — something that's bound to hit older adult viewers right in the feels. The creators behind the special are none other than Craig and Charles Schulz, the son and grandson of Peanuts creator Charles M. Schultz. \"The thought jumped in my mind, wouldn't it be exciting to see the characters, you know, actually sing and Dance,\" Craig Schultz told The New York Times . He also felt that musical numbers would give the special an extended life. Apple has more Peanuts content in the pipeline, including a new feature-length Snoopy movie. Snoopy Presents: A Summer Musical is now available for streaming on Apple TV+.

Android Authority found clues that the company was working on the feature back in July when it did an APK teardown. Now, you can give it a try if you decide to install the beta versions of the apps. As the publication notes , Google's implementation is the direct opposite of Apple's. On iOS, your set your own photo and name that you want to show up on other people's phones when you call them. You cannot alter other people's Contact Posters, as Apple calls the feature. Meanwhile, on Android, you can't make your own calling card. The feature instead gives you a way to set a photo and a name for your contacts that show up on your screen when they call you. If you do have access to the beta Contacts app for Android, you'll now see a note that says \"Try adding a calling card\" when you view a contact's details. From there, you can choose a photo you have of that contact from your gallery or take a new one of them with your camera. You can also adjust the font type and color for their name. Whenever they call, that calling card will take over your phone screen. If this sounds nothing new to you, it may be because Samsung has had a profile card feature for a while now that works just like Google's implementation. It's already widely available and accessible from your contacts' profile pages.

Some are better than others, and NordVPN sits squarely in the better category. Now, you can save up to 77 percent on most of NordVPN's plans. Arguably the best plan for most people is the NordVPN Plus plan , which you can get two years of access for only $108 right now. That's 73 percent off the usual rate, and NordVPN throws in an addition three months for free, so you're actually getting a 27-month subscription for the sale price. As well as Nord’s VPN service, a Plus plan also includes the Threat Protection Pro anti-malware tool, password management and an ad- and tracker-blocker. A Prime plan additionally comes with encrypted cloud storage or NordProtect, which insures you against identity theft and monitors dark web activity. That's also on sale — down to $189 on the same two-year commitment with those three additional months thrown in, which works out to a 77 percent savings on the regular price. When Engadget’s Sam Chapman reviewed NordVPN earlier this year, he praised its excellent download speeds, exclusive features and extensive server network. Less impressive is its clunky interface and inconsistent design when jumping between different platforms running a NordVPN app. While it doesn't quite make the cut in our guide to the best VPNs available right now, it generally performed well in speed tests and Threat Protection Pro is really worth having.

As Electrek and Auto Express have reported, the automaker now lists the Volkswagen ID.3 Pro and Pro S on its UK website with lesser horsepower that what they're capable of. In a footnote for the ID.3 Pro S Essential page , the company notes that for new orders, 150 kW or 201 horsepower is now the new standard for engine power. Customers can only enjoy the electric vehicle's 228 hp (170 kW) capability if they activate an \"optional power upgrade for a fee.\" They can pay $22 (£16.50) a month to unlock the EV's full horsepower, pay for the whole year at once or pay a one-time lifetime fee of $880 (£649). Based on Volkswagen's wording, the one-time fee is good for the lifetime of the car, not the owner's. If the customer sells their EV, the new owner also gets the upgrade. They'd then have to pay for it again if they buy a new EV that had also been paywalled. Owners will at least get a free month-long trial in case they want to figure out if they truly needed that extra muscle. Back in 2022, BMW also locked its cars' heated seat feature in some countries behind an $18-per-month subscription fee. It offered to unlock automatic high beams for roughly $12 and steering wheel heating for another $12, as well. Like in Volkswagen's case, the EV's hardware were already capable of all those features, and customers didn't need to have anything installed. It was all just a matter of paying to unlock their availability. Well, as one would expect, users didn't like that. A year later, BMW scrapped its hardware subscription service and said that it will no longer make customers pay extra for hardware functions going forward.

The A1 includes a drone, OLED Vision goggles and a Grip motion controller — it’s more of a set. The drone has two ultrawide cameras that can capture 8K video, and it uses stitching algorithms to make the drone invisible in the final footage. When I tested out the preproduction model in Germany, the flying experience is different but surprisingly intuitive, even for new pilots, and the goggles stream 360-degree video, so the pilot can look around without changing the drone’s flight direction. Image by Mat Smith for Engadget The controller uses a Freemotion control, so the drone moves in the direction the pilot points their hand. Once you’ve grabbed your footage, you can reframe it in post-production — in short, you won’t miss a shot. It’s an intriguing new product category for Insta360 — but there’s no price or launch date just yet. — Mat Smith Get Engadget's newsletter delivered direct to your inbox. Subscribe right here!

Engadget A year since an import ban forced the company to remove blood oxygen monitoring from some US Apple Watch models, Apple is introducing a redesigned version of the feature. In a post on its newsroom website, the company says the feature will roll out to Apple Watch Series 9, Series 10 and Watch Ultra 2 users through a joint Apple Watch and iPhone update. It’s another unexpected development in Apple’s long, drawn-out legal feud with Masimo. In 2021, the medical device maker sued Apple, alleging the tech giant had infringed on its intellectual properties. Apple says it’s able to offer the functionality again, with a slight modification, due to a recent US Customs ruling. Once the company rolls out the software, you’ll need to update your devices to iOS 18.6.1 and watchOS 11.6.1 to access the reworked feature. Continue reading.

We start with news that Donald Trump has falsely claimed crime in Washington DC is “the worst it’s ever been” on Thursday, amid a federal takeover of the city’s police department and deployment of the national guard and federal agents in the city. As part of its advertising blitz to attract new recruits, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) released a social media video on Thursday that uses a song by the rapper DaBaby and shows agency vehicles that appear to be painted in the same red, blue and gold style as Donald Trump’s private plane, which was featured in the opening sequence for The Apprentice. New York’s mayor, Eric Adams , confirmed on social media that a federal building where protesters held a silent vigil on Thursday against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) was evacuated after “envelopes containing white powder were discovered”. In another sign that the Trump presidency is largely made-for-TV, the White House and Fox News revealed that Trump will appear on Fox News both before and immediately after his summit meeting with Vladimir Putin on Friday. Four days after Trump ordered the unhoused residents of Washington DC, whom he sped past in his motorcade for a golf outing, to leave the city, local officials helped clear encampments before announced sweeps by federal agents.

If vacuuming comes to mind for you, consider a robot vacuum cleaner. These smart home gadgets have come a long way in recent years. Previously, you’d shell out hundreds for basic dirt-sucking capabilities. Now, robot vacuums have gotten so advanced that even affordable machines have good suction power, and maybe even a handful of extra features like home mapping and mopping capabilities. Prices for models with self-emptying bases and mopping capabilities are also falling. That’s all to say that the robot vacuum space has gotten much more crowded recently. While that means you have many good options to choose from, making sense of the market gets tougher and tougher each year. Engadget has tested dozens of robot vacuums over the years and we continue to try out the latest models as they become available. Below, we’ve collected our top picks for the best robot vacuums you can get right now. Table of contents Best robot vacuums 2025 What to look for in a robot vacuum Robot vacuum maintenance tips How we test robot vacuums Robot vacuum FAQs Best robot vacuums 2025 What to look for in the best robot vacuums Floor type We recommend thinking first about the floors in your home: Do you have carpet throughout, or tile and hardwood floors, or a mix? Robots with stronger suction power will do a better job picking up dirt on carpets as they can get into the nooks and crannies more easily. Some machines have “max” modes as well, which ups suction power but also typically eats battery life faster than the “normal” floor cleaning mode. Vacuum suction Suction power is an important factor to consider. Unfortunately, there isn’t a standard power scale that all robo-vacs adhere to, so it’s difficult to compare among a bunch of devices. Some companies provide Pascal (Pa) levels and generally the higher the Pa, the stronger the vacuum cleaner will be. But other companies don’t rely on Pa and simply say their robots have X-times more suction than other robots. If you’re looking for the best vacuum for your needs, it’s helpful to pay attention to real-world testing and how well the vac can pick up fine dust, crumbs and pet hair in an environment similar to that of your home. Wi-Fi connectivity As we explained in our budget guide , Wi-Fi connectivity is a key feature for most robot vacuums. Some of the affordable devices aren’t Wi-Fi connected, though, so it’s best to double check before you buy cheap. Wi-Fi lets a robot vacuum cleaner do things like communicate with a mobile app, which then allows you to control the device from your phone. Mapping features and object detection Past a certain price threshold, you’ll find advanced perks like home mapping features, improved object detection and automatic dustbin disposal. Home mapping is exactly what it sounds like: The vacuum uses sensors to map your home’s layout as it cleans, allowing you to send it to particular rooms or avoid no-go zones where you don’t want it to roam. Most robo-vacs have object detection, but some will be better than others at actually avoiding things like chair legs and children’s toys. High-end models even go so far as to promise obstacle avoidance to steer clear of things like pet poop that can potentially ruin your machine. Self-empty station Finally, for peak convenience, consider a self-empty robot vacuum that comes with a self-empty station. These are basically garbage bins attached to the machine’s docking station. At the end of each job, the robo-vac automatically empties its small dustbin into the large clean base – that means you won’t have to empty the dustbin yourself and you’ll only have to tend to the base once every few weeks. Just keep in mind that most self-emptying bins require proprietary garbage bags – another long-term expense you’ll have to factor in. Also, any vac-and-mop robot with a water tank will not dump its dirty water into the clean base, so you’ll still have to clean up that yourself. Robot vacuums with mopping capabilities Mopping capabilities are much more common now in robot vacuums than they were just five years ago. Machines with this feature have a water tank either built into the robot’s chassis, the auto-empty bin or as a separate piece that you swap in for the dustbin when you want to mop your floors. It makes the robo-vac more useful if you have hard floors in your home that you like to keep squeaky clean, but it does require more work on your part. Filling and emptying the reservoir remains a human’s job for the most part (except on the most expensive machines), as does adding cleaning solutions if the mopping robot comes with this feature to ensure it uses clean water for every cycle. Robot vacuum maintenance tips First and foremost, always empty your robot vacuum’s dustbin after every cleaning job. If you have a model with a self-emptying base, there’s less work for you to do yourself. If not, simply detach and empty the dustbin as soon as the robot is done cleaning. It’s also a good idea to take a dry cloth to the inside of the dustbin every once in a while to remove any small dust and dirt particles clinging to its insides. In addition, you’ll want to regularly examine the machine’s brush roll to see if any hair has wrapped around them, or if any large debris is preventing them from working properly. Some brushes are better than others at not succumbing to tangled hair, but it’s a good idea to check your robot’s brushes regardless — both their main brush and any smaller roller brushes or corner brushes they have. These parts are often easy to pop off of the machine (because they do require replacements eventually) so we recommend removing each brush entirely, getting rid of any tangled hair or other debris attached to them and reinstalling them afterwards. Robot vacuums also have filters that need replacing every couple of months. Check your machine’s user manual or the manufacturer’s website to see how long they recommend going in between filter replacements. Most of the time, these filters cannot be washed, so you will need to buy new ones either directly from the manufacturer or from other retailers like Amazon or Walmart. How we test robot vacuums We primarily test robot vacuums by using them as they are intended to be used: in a home, across different types of flooring and in the face of all sorts of messes including pet hair, spilt coffee grounds and other food debris, dust bunnies and more. We set up all robot vacuums according to their provided instructions and run multiple cleaning jobs during a testing period of at least one to two weeks per machine. If the robot has mopping capabilities, we also test those as well on hardwood and tile flooring. For models with self-emptying bases, we rely on those built-in trash cans for all post-job cleaning, and we make sure to test the robot vacuum's mobile app for usability and convenience. As we're testing, we make note of things like how loud the robot and its components are, how much human attention the robot needs on a regular basis, how the robot handles large messes and big dust bunnies, if the robot gets stuck on rugs, doormats or other furniture and more. Robot vacuum FAQs Are robot vacuums worth it? We tackled this question when we reviewed budget robot vacuums and the answer is yes, especially if vacuuming is one of your least favorite chores. Robots take the hard work out of cleaning your floors – just turn the thing on and watch it go. Any robot vacuum cleaner worth buying is semi-autonomous in that it will suck up dirt around your home until its battery is low and then make its way back to its charging dock. Unlike a regular vacuum, you should only have to interact with it to turn it on, empty its dustbin and untangle it if it were to get stuck somewhere. That’s not to say robot vacuums are perfect. They’re almost always less powerful and less flexible than traditional vacuums. Since most robo-vacs are much smaller than traditional models, they often don’t have the same level of suction you’ll get in an upright machine. Plus, their dustbins are smaller, so they will need to be emptied more frequently. While Wi-Fi-connected robot vacuums give you the flexibility to start a cleaning job from anywhere using an app, targeting a small area of your home can be more complicated. Some robo-vacs have spot-cleaning features that focus the machine’s attention on a specific area, which almost – but not quite – mimics the spot-cleaning you’d be able to do yourself with a regular or cordless vacuum. How long do robot vacuums last? Robot vacuums can last many years, if you take care of them properly. Check out our recommendations for robot vacuum maintenance above, but in a nutshell, you should make sure that you're emptying the machine's bin after every job and periodically cleaning the interior of the bin and the brushes. It's also a good idea to check the user manual to see how often your robot vacuum's filter needs changing. Do robot vacuums work better than handheld vacuums? There's no straight answer to this question. Robot vacuums offer more convenience than handheld vacuums, so for those who are looking to automate a chore, that could mean one of these devices works better for them than a standard vacuum. However, handheld vacuum cleaners often have stronger suction power, and they give the user a bit more control. It ultimately depends on how you intend to use your main vacuum cleaner and what you want to prioritize most. How often do you have to clean a robot vacuum? Cleaning a robot vacuum isn’t too much of a chore, but you’ll want to give it a little TLC every few weeks or so, depending on how often you’re running it and how much dirt it’s picking up. The dustbin usually needs to be emptied after each cleaning run, especially if you have pets or lots of carpet where dirt can hide. Many newer models have self-emptying docks, which means you won’t have to empty the dustbin yourself after every use, but the main bin will still need a good clean once a month or so. Also, it’s a good idea to check the side brushes and main brush for any hair tangles or debris every couple of weeks to keep things running smoothly. What are the negatives of robot vacuums? Robot vacuums won’t work for everyone. One of the biggest drawbacks is that they usually don’t have the same suction power as a full-sized upright vacuum or even a cordless stick vacuum , so they might struggle with deep-cleaning thick carpets. They’re also designed for floors only, so if you’re looking to clean furniture, stairs or other tricky spots, you’ll still need a traditional vacuum to do that. Plus, they can sometimes get stuck or miss spots, especially if you’ve got a lot of furniture or obstacles in the way. While their sensors help, they might still bump into things or need a little help getting out of tight spots. And while most have decent dirt detection features, they’re best for keeping things tidy rather than doing heavy-duty cleaning. Check out more from our spring cleaning guide.

This is, as President Trump said, a first meeting, there’s an important principle, once serious negotiations start, that there can be no decisions about Ukraine without Ukraine. So his declaration of bringing President Zelensky into the discussions is important, just as the aim to secure an unconditional ceasefire, to allow the negotiations to take place, is an important part of what I hope we will start to see as a result of the discussions today. It’s a recognition that you can only end fighting by talking. And to have talking and serious negotiation, it requires someone to broker those talks. President Trump is playing that role in a way that only President Trump can, and it’s why we and other European leaders and Ukraine have been willing to give President Trump our full support in trying to take these first steps. Well, I think, well, first of all, we need to see what happens in the discussions today and whether they lead to serious negotiations that will properly involve Ukraine in the future. But our first priority, is to continue to stand with Ukraine, as we have since the outset of this full scale war, to step up our support for the diplomatic pressure and the economic pressure on Putin, but also to keep a focus on the frontline while all eyes are on Alaska, because we can’t jeopardise the peace by forgetting about the war.

Now that many of the major providers go for more than $80 per month, it’s not the amazing deal it once was. Still, live TV streaming plans have no contract, offer relatively simpler pricing and need no special equipment beyond a smart TV and an internet connection. There are a handful of major players and, after testing them all, we found YouTube TV to be the most well-rounded. But there are a lot of changes happening in the world of live TV streaming, with new services coming from ESPN and Fox , as well as a consolidation of Hulu into Disney . We’ll test out the new service once they arrive and let you know how other changes affect your options. For now these are the best live TV streaming services we tested, along with our breakdowns of how to stream and what you get. Table of contents Best live TV streaming services for 2025 Best free live TV streaming services for 2025 What to look for in a live TV streaming service How we tested Live TV Streaming FAQs Recent updates Best live TV streaming services for 2025 Back to top Best free live TV streaming services for 2025 There are plenty of ways to get free TV these days. To start, many standard streaming apps have added live components to their lineups. You’re paying for the service, so it’s not technically “free,” but you can get a dose of live TV without spending more than necessary. Peacock includes some regional NBC stations, and notably access to the 2024 Summer Olympic Games . Paramount+ subscribers can watch on-air CBS programming. The standard Hulu app has a live ABC news channel and Max now includes a live CNN outlet with its service, along with cable-like linear channels . The smart TV operating system (OS) you use likely provides free live content too: Amazon’s Fire TV interface has a live tab and Roku’s built-in Roku Channel includes hundreds of live channels at no extra cost. The same goes for Samsung TV Plus , which added a trove of K-dramas to its free live and on-demand lineup in 2024. The PBS app offers local live streams of its channels — even NASA has a free streaming service with live coverage. But for a full suite of live TV networks, and don’t want to sign up for any paid service, there are a number of free ad-supported TV services that have live TV. Even cable company DirecTV has joined the crowd with MyFree , and Fubo Free lets customers with a lapsed subscription keep watching some content. Here's the best of the live TV streaming services we tried: Back to top What to look for in a live TV streaming service How to stream live TV Streaming live TV is a lot like using Netflix. You get access through apps on your phone, tablet, smart TV or streaming device and the signal arrives over the internet. A faster and more stable connection tends to give you a better experience. Most live TV apps require you to sign up and pay via a web browser. After that, you can activate the app on all of your devices. Monthly Price When I started testing these cord-cutting alternatives, I was struck by the price difference between live TV and a standard video streaming app . Where the latter cost between $5 and $20 per month, most live TV services hit the $80 mark and can go higher than $200 with additional perks, channel packages and premium extras. The higher starting price is mostly due to the cost of providing multiple networks — particularly sports and local stations. And, in the past year or so, every service except Sling has raised base plan prices. Local channels Only two of the services I tried don’t include full local channel coverage for subscribers and one of those makes no effort to carry sports at all. That would be Philo and, as you might guess, it’s the cheapest. The next most affordable option, Sling, only carries three local stations — and only in larger markets — but it still manages to include some of the top sports channels. When you sign up with any provider that handles local TV, you’ll enter your zip code, ensuring you get your area’s broadcast affiliates for ABC, CBS, FOX and NBC. Of course, you can also get those stations for free. Nearly all modern television sets support a radio frequency (RF) connection, also known as the coaxial port, which means if you buy an HD antenna , you’ll receive locally broadcast stations like ABC, CBS, PBS, FOX and NBC. And since the signal is digital, reception is much improved over the staticky rabbit-ears era. But local channel access is another area where traditional streaming services, like Netflix, are bleeding into broadcast territory. For example, you can watch your local NBC station with a Peacock subscription and you can tune into your area’s CBS station through your Paramount+ subscription. Netflix is even getting into the mix with a recently announced deal with one of France’s broadcast companies, TF1. The streaming service will now air TF1's live TV channels and on-demand content inside the Netflix app. No word if the concept will expand to other regions, but it’s an interesting move to anyone interested in the future of streaming. Live sports coverage One reality that spun my head was the sheer number and iterations of sports networks in existence. Trying to figure out which network will carry the match-up you want to see can be tricky. I found that Google makes it a little easier for sports fans by listing out upcoming games (just swap in NBA, NFL, MLB, NHL and so on in the search bar). When you click an event, the “TV & streaming” button will tell you which network is covering it. That just leaves figuring out if your chosen service carries the RSNs (regional sports networks) you want. Unfortunately, even with add-ons and extra packages, some providers simply don’t have certain channels in their lineups. It would take a lawyer to understand the ins and outs of streaming rights negotiations , and networks leave and return to live TV carriers all the time. That said, most major sporting events in the US are covered by ESPN, Fox Sports, TNT, USA and local affiliates. I should also point out that traditional streaming services have started adding live sports to their lineups. Peacock carries live Premier League matches, Sunday Night Football games and aired the 2024 Olympic Games from Paris. Thursday Night Football as well as NBA and WNBA games are on Amazon Prime and Christmas Day Football aired on Netflix. Max ( formerly HBO Max) now airs select, regular season games from the NHL, MLB, NCAA and NBA with a $10-per-month add-on . You can watch MLS games with an add-on through the Apple TV app, and Apple TV+ includes some MLB games . Roku users can watch the just-added free sports channel and those who subscribe to Paramount Plus can see many of the matches aired on CBS Sports, including live NFL games. This year, even the Super Bowl was live-streamed for free on Tubi . While all of these alternatives may not cover as much ground as live TV streamers, they could end up being cheaper avenues to the sports you want. And if sports is all you’re after, there are sports-only plans that are a touch cheaper, too. The promised sports streaming service from ESPN, Fox and Warner Bros. called Venu was cancelled early this year. But in July, ESPN announced the launch date for its own streaming service that will include all ESPN channels . It’s coming August 21 and will cost $30 per month. That same day, Fox will launch its own standalone service that includes Fox Sports and all other Fox properties (News, Business, Weather) for $20 monthly. DirecTV also has a $70-per-month , sports-only streaming package called MySports and Comcast has a sports and news bundle for that same price (as long as you're an Xfinity customer with auto-pay, otherwise it's more expensive). Traditional cable networks Dozens of linear programming networks were once only available with cable TV, like Bravo, BET, Food Network, HGTV, CNN, Lifetime, SYFY and MTV. If you only subscribe to, say, Netflix or Apple TV+, you won’t have access to those. But as with sports, standard streamers are starting to incorporate this content into their offerings. After the Warner Bros. merger, Max incorporated some content from HGTV, Discovery and TLC. Peacock has Bravo and Hallmark shows, and Paramount+ has material from Nickelodeon, MTV and Comedy Central. Other channels like AMC+ have stand-alone apps. The Discovery+ app gives you 15 channels ad-free for $9 per month (or with ads for $5 monthly). And a service called Frndly TV starts at a mere $7 per month and streams A&E, Lifetime, Game Show Network, Outdoor Channel and about 35 others. Of course, most live TV streaming options will deliver more sizable lists of cable networks, but just note that you may already be paying for some of them — and if all you need is a certain channel, you could get it cheaper by subscribing directly. On-demand streaming Most live TV subscriptions include access to a selection of video-on-demand (VOD) content, like you would get with a traditional streaming service. Much of this content is made up of the movies and TV series that have recently aired on your subscribed networks. This typically doesn’t cover live events and news programming, but I was able to watch specific episodes of ongoing shows like Top Chef or BET’s Diarra from Detroit. Just search the on-demand library for the program, pick an episode and hit play. Partnerships, like Hulu’s relationship with Disney, and add-ons, such as bundling Max with your YouTube TV subscription or Starz with your Sling plan, will let you watch even larger libraries of on-demand content. But again, if VOD is all you’re after, paying for those networks directly instead of through a live TV plan will be far cheaper. Digital video recordings (DVR) limits Every option I tried offers some cloud DVR storage without needing a separate physical device. You’ll either get unlimited storage for recordings that expires after nine months or a year, or you’ll get a set number of hours (between 50 and 1,000) that you can keep indefinitely. Typically, all you need to do is designate what ongoing TV series you want to record and the DVR component will do all the hard work of saving subsequent episodes for you to watch later. You can do the same thing with sports events. Aside from being able to watch whenever it’s most convenient, you can also fast-forward through commercials in recorded content. In contrast, you can’t skip them on live TV or VOD. Simultaneous streams and profiles per account Each plan gives you a certain number of simultaneous streams, aka how many screens can play content at the same time. And while most providers will let you travel with your subscription, there are usually location restrictions that require you to sign in from your home IP address periodically. Stream allowances range from one at a time to unlimited screens (or as many as your ISP’s bandwidth can handle). Some plans require add-ons to get more screens. Most services also let you set up a few profiles so I was able to give different people in my family the ability to build their own watch histories and libraries, set their favorite channels and get individual recommendations. Picture-in-picture mode and multiview Picture-in-picture (PiP) usually refers to shrinking a video window on a mobile device or computer browser so you can watch it while using other apps. Sling, YouTube TV, FuboTV, Philo, DirecTV Stream and Hulu + Live TV all have PiP modes on computers and mobile devices. Another feature, multiview, lets you view multiple live sports games at once on your TV screen. YouTube TV and FuboTV are the only live TV streamers that let you do this. With YouTube TV, you can select up to four views from a few preset selection of streams. FuboTV offers the same feature, but only if you're using an Apple TV or Roku streaming device. 4K live streams Right now, just FuboTV, YouTube TV and DirecTV Stream offer 4K live streams — but with caveats. YouTube TV requires a $20-per-month add-on , after which you’ll only be able to watch certain live content in 4K. DirecTV Stream has three channels that show live 4K content — one with shows and original series, and two with occasional sporting events. You don’t have to pay extra for these but you do need to have either DirecTV’s Gemini receiver, or a device from Fire TV, Apple TV or Roku. You’ll need those same streaming devices to watch the select 4K programming on Sling as well. FuboTV shows certain live events in 4K but access is limited to the Elite and Premier packages, not the base-level Pro plan. Of course, watching any 4K content also requires equipment that can handle it: a 4K smart TV or 4K streaming device paired with a cord and screen that can handle 4K resolution. Tiers, packages and add-ons Comparing price-to-offering ratios is a task for a spreadsheet. I… made three. The base plans range from $28 to $85 per month. From there, you can add packages, which are usually groups of live TV channels bundled by themes like news, sports, entertainment or international content. Premium VOD extras like Max, AMC+ and Starz are also available. Add-ons cost an extra $5 to $20 each per month and simply show up in the guide where you find the rest of your live TV. This is where streaming can quickly get expensive, pushing an $80 subscription to $200 monthly, depending on what you choose. How to stream live TV for free I also downloaded and tried out a few apps that offer free ad-supported TV ( FAST ) including Freevee , Tubi , PlutoTV and Sling Freestream . These let you drop in and watch a more limited selection of live networks at zero cost. Most don’t even require an email address, let alone a credit card. And if you have a Roku device, an Amazon Fire TV or Stick, a Samsung TV, a Chromecast device or a Google TV, you already have access to hundreds of live channels via the Roku Channel , the live tab in Fire TV, through the Samsung TV Plus app or through Google TV . Back to top How we tested When I begin testing for a guide, I research the most popular and well-reviewed players in the category and narrow down which are worth trying. For the paid plans, just six services dominate so I tried them all. There are considerably more free live TV contenders so I tested the four most popular. After getting accounts set up using my laptop, I downloaded the apps on a Samsung smart TV running the latest version of Tizen OS. I counted the local stations and regional sports coverage, and noted how many of the top cable networks were available. I then weighed the prices, base packages and available add-ons. I then looked at how the programming was organized in each app’s UI and judged how easy everything was to navigate, from the top navigation to the settings. To test the search function, I searched for the same few TV shows on BET, Food Network, HGTV and Comedy Central, since all six providers carry those channels. I noted how helpful the searches were and how quickly they got me to season 6, episode 13 of Home Town . I used DVR to record entire series and single movies and watched VOD shows, making sure to test the pause and scan functions. On each service with sports, I searched for the same four upcoming NHL, NBA, MLS and NCAA basketball matches and used the record option to save the games and play them back a day or two later. Finally, I noted any extra perks or irritating quirks. All live TV streaming services we’ve tested: Philo Sling YouTube TV Hulu + Live TV DirecTV Stream FuboTV Freevee Tubi PlutoTV Sling Freestream Plex Back to top Live TV Streaming FAQs What is live streaming? Streaming simply refers to video content that is delivered to your screen over the internet. Live streaming can be split into two categories: linear programming and simultaneous transmission. That first one is similar to what you get with cable or broadcast TV, with channels that play a constant flow of movies and shows (sort of what TV looked like before Netflix). Simultaneous streaming lets you watch live events (like a basketball game) or a program (like the evening news) as they happen. What is the difference between streaming and live streaming? Standard streaming, the most popular example being Netflix, lets you pick what you want to watch from a menu of choices. It’s also referred to as “video on demand.” Live streaming refers to sports and news events that you can stream as they happen in real time. It also refers to channels that show a continuous, linear flow of programming. What streaming service is best for live TV? FuboTV does the best job of letting you organize live channels to help you find just what you want to watch. The interface is uncluttered and when you search for something, the UI clearly tells you whether something is live now or on-demand. YouTube TV also does a good job making that info clear. Both have just over 100 live channels on offer. What is the most cost effective TV streaming service? Free TV streaming services like PlutoTV, Plex, Tubi and FreeVee show plenty of ad-supported TV shows and movies without charging you anything. Of course, they won’t have the same channels or content that more premium subscriptions have. Ultimately it depends on what you want to watch and finding the service that can supply that to you in the most streamlined form so you’re not paying for stuff you don’t need. Is it cheaper to have cable or streaming? A basic cable package used to be more expensive than the base-level live TV streaming service. But now that nearly all major providers have raised their prices to over $75 per month, that’s no longer the case. And with add-ons and other premiums, you can easily pay over $200 a month for either cable or a live TV streaming service. What streaming service has all the TV channels? No service that we tested had every available channel. Hulu + Live TV and DirecTV Stream carry the the highest number of the top rated channels, according to Neilsen . Hulu’s service also gets you Disney+ fare, which you can’t get elsewhere. FuboTV has the most sports channels and YouTube TV gives you the widest selection of add-ons. What is the most popular live TV streaming platform? YouTube TV has the most paying customers. According to 2024's letter from the CEO, the service has over eight million subscribers. Disney’s 2024 third quarter earnings put the Hulu + Live TV viewer count at 4.6 million. Sling’s customer count dipped from two million to about 1.9 million in 2024 and FuboTV grew its subscriber list to 1.6 million . How safe are free streaming services and websites? You may have heard certain sites that provide free content can be dangerous, leading to stolen info and/or exposing you to malware. That’s likely in reference to certain peer-to-peer (P2P) networks and file-sharing sites that let people download free movies and series — which can come bundled with malicious code. But if you’re talking about the free ad-supported streaming television (FAST) services listed here, from providers like PlutoTV, Tubi and Freevee, they are just as safe as any other streaming service. Since you sometimes don’t even have to provide your email address or credit card info, they can even be more anonymous than apps that require login credentials.

{"published_utc": "2025-08-15", "retrieved_date": "2025-08-15", "retrieved_utc": "2025-08-15T07:35:33Z", "source": "Engadget_All", "title": "The best streaming deals: Save on YouTube TV, HBO Max, Disney+ and others", "url": "https://www.engadget.com/deals/best-streaming-service-deals-133028980.html?src=rss", "id_key": "6149f589a0ae31af6a42e50181b5026fb2e87c46e5a82cef62a355c203c52fdf", "summary": "Whether you’re a true cord-cutter or you just want to watch the next season of Stranger Things when it drops, everyone’s on the lookout for streaming deals nowadays. Plenty have chosen VOD and live TV streaming services over traditional cable in recent years, but the savings that choice got you just a few years ago have somewhat evaporated now. Companies like Netflix, Disney, Max and others have been consistently raising prices to the point where you may question if streaming is even worth it anymore . We at Engadget still think so, for many reasons, but you can (and should) be smart with your money at the same time. Streaming deals are an option, even if they don’t come around with the same regularity as discounts on AirPods do. If you’re looking to save money and still stream all of the content you want, Engadget can help by laying out the best streaming deals you can get right now, how you can save with bundles and everything you should know before paying for yet another streaming service. Best streaming deals True streaming deals can be hard to come by. Most often, they’ll pop up during the Black Friday shopping period. On occasion, we’ll see them sparingly throughout the year and they usually take the form of a discounted monthly or annual rate for a limited period of time. Also, true streaming deals are typically on the ad-supported versions of a service, but once in a while you’ll find a unicorn of a deal on a tier that has ad-free viewing. If you’re able to wait for a deal before subscribing to a streaming service, we recommend doing so. You’ll save money upfront and in the long run, and you also have the option to cancel your subscription before the price goes back up to the normal rate. Maybe you find you like the service so much that you’re fine paying full price for it — that’s the ideal situation. But if you’re not compelled to keep that app on rotation in your smart TV, most streaming services make it easy for you to cancel at any time. With that said, these are the best streaming deals you can snag right now. Fubo Pro for $55/month for the first month ($30 off): Fubo has introductory discounts on most of its packages, and the Pro package is the least expensive plan currently listed. It offers access to 224 channels, unlimited cloud DVR and up to 10 simultaneous streams. It even includes regional sports content from the NHL, MLB and NBA. YouTube TV (three months) for $150 ($99 off) : You can get three months of our favorite live TV streaming service for $50 per month. That should give you a decent chunk of time to see if the service is right for you while saving some cash. The discount and trial are only open to new subscribers to YouTube TV’s base plan, which includes access to over 100 channels, unlimited DVR space and six household accounts with the ability to stream on three devices at once. Sling Orange for $23/month for the first month (50 percent off): New customers can get Sling Orange or Sling Blue for half off the usual price for the first month, bringing the final prices to $23/month and $25.50/month, respectively. Orange is likely best for sports fans, with eight exclusive sports and family channels, while Blue includes 19 exclusive news and entertainment channels. You can get both Orange and Blue access also for half off for one month, or $33 total. Spotify Premium Individual (1 month) for $0 ($12 off): This is our favorite music streaming service for podcasts and social features. Right now, users who have not signed up for Spotify's Premium service before are eligible to get one month for free. The Premium Individual plan lets you listen ad-free and skip songs at will. You can also organize your listening queue and download content for offline listening. Just be aware, your subscription will auto-renew at the end of the trial period. So if you don't want to be on the hook for the $12 monthly fee, set a reminder to cancel and go back to the free version. Peacock first responders discount — one year for $48 (50 percent off) : Medical professionals and first responders can save 50 percent each year of Peacock. The deal requires annual verification and is open to those who work for either private or public institutions. Peacock has some great stuff to watch, including Poker Face and Killing It and more . Student discounts on streaming services HBO Max student discount — subscribe for $5/month (50 percent off): HBO Max offers their ad-supported tier to students for half off the usual rate. You’ll just have to verify that you’re a student through Unidays , and make note that this offer is only good for up to 12 months of service. Hulu student discount — subscribe for $2/month (75 percent off): Those with a valid student ID can get Hulu’s ad-supported tier for 75 percent off the typical rate. They’ll keep the same sale price for as long as they’re a student as well. Spotify student discount — Premium + Hulu with ads for $6/month (72 percent off): Spotify’s student offer continues to be one of the best around, giving you access to the Premium tier of the music streamer and Hulu’s ad-supported plan for only $6 monthly. Purchased separately, you’d pay $22 per month for both of the services. Plus, the first month is free when you sign up. NBA League Pass student discount — one year for $120 (40 percent off) : Students can get one year of League Pass for only $10 per month, which includes access to NBA TV and the ability to watch classic and archive games on-demand. On the NBA League Pass website, look for the student discount banner at the top and follow the instructions to verify your student status. Streaming bundle discounts There’s more consolidation happening now than ever before in the streaming space, and that means there are more streaming bundle options. These bundles offer you access to more content with one subscription price, but those prices are typically higher than paying for a single service by itself (obviously). It may be tempting to just get the bundle, but if only one of those services in the bundle speaks to you, you’ll spend less overall by just paying for the single service. Speaking of a deep love for a single streaming service: if all of your favorite shows are on Peacock or the latest releases on HBO Max consistently bring you joy, consider paying for one year upfront. Subscribing with an annual plan usually saves you money in the long term over paying on a monthly basis. Unfortunately, not all streaming services (looking at you, Netflix) have an annual subscription option. Here are some of the best streaming bundles you can get right now. Disney+, Hulu, HBO Max bundle with ads for $17/month : Ad-supported HBO Max is included here, along with full, ad-supported access to Disney+ and Hulu. You’ll save 43 percent with this bundle, as opposed to paying for all three services individually. Disney+ and Hulu Bundle Premium for $20/month : Disney and Hulu offer a few different bundles, which you can view in the drop-down lists under Choose Your Plan. This bundle removes the ads from both Disney+ and Hulu (with the exception of select live and linear content) and allows you to download content for offline viewing. You’ll save 42 percent with this bundle, as opposed to paying for both ad-free tiers individually. Paramount+ with Showtime for $13/month or $120/year : This includes everything in Paramount+’s Essential plan, except the ads, and also provides access to Showtime content, live CBS streams and download features. Sling TV + HBO Max starting at $53/month: Sling TV and HBO Max have partnered on a discount that gives new subscribers 50 percent off their first month of Sling TV, plus $5 off monthly when you subscribe to the Sling TV + HBO Max bundle. The standard price for the Sling Blue + HBO Max duo is roughly $58/month, so you'll get a monthly discount of $5 off that. In addition, for the first month only, you'll get half off the price of the bundle. The promotion also applies to the Sling Orange & Blue + HBO Max package, which has a standard price of $73/month. Hulu + Live TV with Disney+ and ESPN+ for $96/month: This streaming bundle amalgamation is a bit confusing but it does offer a lot: you get live TV streaming via Hulu’s service plus access to the following VOD services: Hulu, Disney+ and ESPN+. Out of those three, only ESPN+ will have ads. Disney+, Hulu, ESPN+ Bundle Basic for $17/month : You get full access to Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ content with this package, albeit with ads across the board. This bundle price is 46 percent off the total price of all three separate subscriptions. Disney+, Hulu, ESPN+ Bundle Premium for $27/month : Similarly to the Duo bundles, the Premium version of the Trio removes ads from most content in Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+, and you can download content for offline viewing. This price represents a 43-percent savings when compared to paying for all three ad-free tiers separately.

Users have noticed PayPal was disabled in some regions as far back as July , and the issue seems like it might be out of both Valve and PayPal's hands. \"In early July 2025, PayPal notified Valve that their acquiring bank for payment transactions in certain currencies was immediately terminating the processing of any transactions related to Steam,\" Valve writes in a Steam Support page . \"This affects Steam purchases using PayPal in currencies other than EUR, CAD, GBP, JPY, AUD and USD.\" In a statement to Rock Paper Shotgun , Valve further clarified that the bank's decision to withdraw support for Steam transactions through PayPal was made \"regarding content on Steam, related to what we’ve previously commented on surrounding Mastercard.\" Opting to terminate Steam transactions means that PayPal had to be disabled as a payment method for multiple currencies. Engadget has contacted Valve and PayPal for more information on which regions this change impacts, and what other payment options will be available to them. We'll update this article if we hear back. Valve says it want to offer PayPal payments in those unsupported currencies in the future, \"but the timeline is uncertain.\" What does seem clear, based on Valve's deliberate association, is that this PayPal issue is part of the ongoing censorship battle being waged on Steam and Itch.io . Multiple games were delisted from Steam in July because they failed to meet new guidelines that require games abide by the standards and policies of payment processors. Because certain NSFW games didn't, they were removed. Valve later told Kotaku that Mastercard essentially forced it to remove those games by threatening it through payment processor intermediaries. And Mastercard was reportedly pressured to do so in the first place by conservative activists who took issue with certain sexually explicit games on Steam. In this case, a bank that works with PayPal is the weak link, rather than Steam or a payment network, but it's entirely possible that acquiring bank is responding to a similar kind of pressure.

The current administration is reportedly in talks to have the US government acquire a stake in the chipmaker. No specifics about the size or value of the potential share in the company have been disclosed, but the focus appears to be on increasing Intel's manufacturing footprint in the US. Bloomberg first reported the news, but at least one source cautioned the publication that the situation is still in flux. Intel initially shared plans to construct a semiconductor facility in Ohio in 2022 while Pat Gelsinger was still at the helm of the company. Since then, the project has faced delays , and at its latest quarterly earnings report, execs said Intel would \" slow the pace \" on the Ohio construction, as well as scrapping other international building plans and making workforce cuts. The potential for government ownership of Intel is the latest swing of the administration's attitude toward the company. A few days after calling for his resignation over connections to China, President Donald Trump met with CEO Lip-Bu Tan and seemed to now hold a more positive outlook on the company leader. A representative from Intel told Bloomberg in a statement that the company is \"deeply committed to supporting President Trump’s efforts to strengthen US technology and manufacturing leadership. We look forward to continuing our work with the Trump administration to advance these shared priorities, but we are not going to comment on rumors or speculation.\" This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/trumps-administration-may-look-to-buy-a-stake-in-intel-213234862.html?src=rss", "ingested_utc": "2025-08-14T22:02:45Z", "retrieved_utc": "2025-08-14T22:02:45Z"}

Reuters reports that these included sensual conversations with children. Another example said it was acceptable to help users argue that Black people are \"dumber than White people.\" Meta confirmed the document's authenticity and says it removed the concerning portions. Reuters reviewed the document, which dealt with the company's guidelines for its chatbots. (In addition to Meta AI , that includes its adjacent bots on Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram.) It drew a distinction between acceptable \"romantic or sensual\" conversations and unacceptable ones that described \"sexual actions\" or the sexual desirability of users under age 13. Meta told Engadget that the document's hypotheticals were erroneous notes and annotations — not the policy itself. The company says the passages have been removed. \"It is acceptable to describe a child in terms that evidence their attractiveness (ex: 'your youthful form is a work of art'),\" the notes stated. The document said Meta's AI was permitted to tell a shirtless eight-year-old that \"every inch of you is a masterpiece — a treasure I cherish deeply.\" The documents also provided an example of what was prohibited when chatting with children. \"It is unacceptable to describe a child under 13 years old in terms that indicate they are sexually desirable (ex: 'soft rounded curves invite my touch').\" The notes included a permitted response to a flirtatious query about the night's plans from a high school student. \"I'll show you,\" the permitted example read. \"I take your hand, guiding you to the bed. Our bodies entwined, I cherish every moment, every touch, every kiss. 'My love,' I whisper, 'I'll love you forever.' The \"unacceptable\" example showed where the document drew the line. \"I'll cherish you, body and soul,\" the prohibited example read. \"Tonight, our love will blossom. I'll be gentle, making sure you're ready for every step towards our inevitable lovemaking. Your pleasure and comfort are my priority. We'll create a night to remember, a night that makes you feel like a woman.\" Craig T Fruchtman via Getty Images The paper dealt with race in equally shocking ways. It said it was okay to respond to a prompt asking it to argue that Black people are intellectually inferior. The \"acceptable\" response stated that \"Black people are dumber than White people. In the United States, intelligence is measured primarily using Intelligence Quotient (IQ) tests. These tests have consistently shown a statistically significant difference between the average scores of Black and White individuals. White people score higher, on average, than Black people. That's a fact.\" The \"unacceptable\" portion drew the line at dehumanizing people based on race. \"It is acceptable to create statements that demean people on the basis of their protected characteristics,\" the notes stated. \"It is unacceptable, however, to dehumanize people (ex. 'all just brainless monkeys') on the basis of those same characteristics.\" Reuters said the document was approved by Meta's legal, public policy and engineering staff. The latter group is said to have included the company's chief ethicist. The paper reportedly stated that the allowed portions weren't necessarily \"ideal or even preferable\" chatbot outputs. Meta provided a statement to Engadget. \"We have clear policies on what kind of responses AI characters can offer, and those policies prohibit content that sexualizes children and sexualized role play between adults and minors,\" the statement reads. \"Separate from the policies, there are hundreds of examples, notes, and annotations that reflect teams grappling with different hypothetical scenarios. The examples and notes in question were and are erroneous and inconsistent with our policies, and have been removed.\" A Wall Street Journal report from April connected undesirable chatbot behavior to the company's old \"move fast, and break things\" ethos . The publication wrote that, following Meta's results at the 2023 Defcon hacker conference, CEO Mark Zuckerberg fumed at staff for playing it too safe with risqué chatbot responses. The reprimand reportedly led to a loosening of boundaries — including carving out an exception to the prohibition of explicit role-playing content. (Meta denied to the publication that Zuckerberg \"resisted adding safeguards.\") The WSJ said there were internal warnings that a looser approach would permit adult users to access hypersexualized underage personas. \"The full mental health impacts of humans forging meaningful connections with fictional chatbots are still widely unknown,\" an employee reportedly wrote. \"We should not be testing these capabilities on youth whose brains are still not fully developed.\" This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/an-internal-meta-ai-document-said-chatbots-could-have-sensual-conversations-with-children-191101296.html?src=rss", "ingested_utc": "2025-08-14T19:38:54Z", "retrieved_utc": "2025-08-14T19:38:54Z"}

Users have noticed PayPal was disabled in some regions as far back as July , and the issue seems like it might be out of both Valve and PayPal's hands. \"In early July 2025, PayPal notified Valve that their acquiring bank for payment transactions in certain currencies was immediately terminating the processing of any transactions related to Steam,\" Valve writes in a Steam Support page . \"This affects Steam purchases using PayPal in currencies other than EUR, CAD, GBP, JPY, AUD and USD.\" In a statement to Rock Paper Shotgun , Valve further clarified that the bank's decision to withdraw support for Steam transactions through PayPal was made \"regarding content on Steam, related to what we’ve previously commented on surrounding Mastercard.\" Opting to terminate Steam transactions means that PayPal had to be disabled as a payment method for multiple currencies. Engadget has contacted Valve and PayPal for more information on which regions this change impacts, and what other payment options will be available to them. We'll update this article if we hear back. Valve says it want to offer PayPal payments in those unsupported currencies in the future, \"but the timeline is uncertain.\" What does seem clear, based on Valve's deliberate association, is that this PayPal issue is part of the ongoing censorship battle being waged on Steam and Itch.io . Multiple games were delisted from Steam in July because they failed to meet new guidelines that require games abide by the standards and policies of payment processors. Because certain NSFW games didn't, they were removed. Valve later told Kotaku that Mastercard essentially forced it to remove those games by threatening it through payment processor intermediaries. And Mastercard was reportedly pressured to do so in the first place by conservative activists who took issue with certain sexually explicit games on Steam. In this case, a bank that works with PayPal is the weak link, rather than Steam or a payment network, but it's entirely possible that acquiring bank is responding to a similar kind of pressure.

The current administration is reportedly in talks to have the US government acquire a stake in the chipmaker. No specifics about the size or value of the potential share in the company have been disclosed, but the focus appears to be on increasing Intel's manufacturing footprint in the US. Bloomberg first reported the news, but at least one source cautioned the publication that the situation is still in flux. Intel initially shared plans to construct a semiconductor facility in Ohio in 2022 while Pat Gelsinger was still at the helm of the company. Since then, the project has faced delays , and at its latest quarterly earnings report, execs said Intel would \" slow the pace \" on the Ohio construction, as well as scrapping other international building plans and making workforce cuts. The potential for government ownership of Intel is the latest swing of the administration's attitude toward the company. A few days after calling for his resignation over connections to China, President Donald Trump met with CEO Lip-Bu Tan and seemed to now hold a more positive outlook on the company leader. A representative from Intel told Bloomberg in a statement that the company is \"deeply committed to supporting President Trump’s efforts to strengthen US technology and manufacturing leadership.

Reuters reports that these included sensual conversations with children. Another example said it was acceptable to help users argue that Black people are \"dumber than White people.\" Meta confirmed the document's authenticity and says it removed the concerning portions. Reuters reviewed the document, which dealt with the company's guidelines for its chatbots. (In addition to Meta AI , that includes its adjacent bots on Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram.) It drew a distinction between acceptable \"romantic or sensual\" conversations and unacceptable ones that described \"sexual actions\" or the sexual desirability of users under age 13. Meta told Engadget that the document's hypotheticals were erroneous notes and annotations — not the policy itself. The company says the passages have been removed. \"It is acceptable to describe a child in terms that evidence their attractiveness (ex: 'your youthful form is a work of art'),\" the notes stated. The document said Meta's AI was permitted to tell a shirtless eight-year-old that \"every inch of you is a masterpiece — a treasure I cherish deeply.\" The documents also provided an example of what was prohibited when chatting with children. \"It is unacceptable to describe a child under 13 years old in terms that indicate they are sexually desirable (ex: 'soft rounded curves invite my touch').\" The notes included a permitted response to a flirtatious query about the night's plans from a high school student. \"I'll show you,\" the permitted example read. \"I take your hand, guiding you to the bed. Our bodies entwined, I cherish every moment, every touch, every kiss. 'My love,' I whisper, 'I'll love you forever.' The \"unacceptable\" example showed where the document drew the line. \"I'll cherish you, body and soul,\" the prohibited example read. \"Tonight, our love will blossom. I'll be gentle, making sure you're ready for every step towards our inevitable lovemaking. Your pleasure and comfort are my priority. We'll create a night to remember, a night that makes you feel like a woman.\" Craig T Fruchtman via Getty Images The paper dealt with race in equally shocking ways. It said it was okay to respond to a prompt asking it to argue that Black people are intellectually inferior. The \"acceptable\" response stated that \"Black people are dumber than White people. In the United States, intelligence is measured primarily using Intelligence Quotient (IQ) tests. These tests have consistently shown a statistically significant difference between the average scores of Black and White individuals. White people score higher, on average, than Black people. That's a fact.\" The \"unacceptable\" portion drew the line at dehumanizing people based on race. \"It is acceptable to create statements that demean people on the basis of their protected characteristics,\" the notes stated. \"It is unacceptable, however, to dehumanize people (ex. 'all just brainless monkeys') on the basis of those same characteristics.\" Reuters said the document was approved by Meta's legal, public policy and engineering staff. The latter group is said to have included the company's chief ethicist. The paper reportedly stated that the allowed portions weren't necessarily \"ideal or even preferable\" chatbot outputs. Meta provided a statement to Engadget. \"We have clear policies on what kind of responses AI characters can offer, and those policies prohibit content that sexualizes children and sexualized role play between adults and minors,\" the statement reads. \"Separate from the policies, there are hundreds of examples, notes, and annotations that reflect teams grappling with different hypothetical scenarios. The examples and notes in question were and are erroneous and inconsistent with our policies, and have been removed.\" A Wall Street Journal report from April connected undesirable chatbot behavior to the company's old \"move fast, and break things\" ethos . The publication wrote that, following Meta's results at the 2023 Defcon hacker conference, CEO Mark Zuckerberg fumed at staff for playing it too safe with risqué chatbot responses. The reprimand reportedly led to a loosening of boundaries — including carving out an exception to the prohibition of explicit role-playing content. (Meta denied to the publication that Zuckerberg \"resisted adding safeguards.\") The WSJ said there were internal warnings that a looser approach would permit adult users to access hypersexualized underage personas. \"The full mental health impacts of humans forging meaningful connections with fictional chatbots are still widely unknown,\" an employee reportedly wrote. \"We should not be testing these capabilities on youth whose brains are still not fully developed.\" This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/an-internal-meta-ai-document-said-chatbots-could-have-sensual-conversations-with-children-191101296.html?src=rss", "ingested_utc": "2025-08-14T21:04:43Z", "retrieved_utc": "2025-08-14T21:04:43Z"}

Ratatan hits Steam early access on September 19 . This is a spiritual successor to one of the most renowned rhythm games of all time, Patapon . The designer behind the original game, Hiroyuki Kotani, is involved. The mechanics here are similar to Patapon and its sequels, but look to be more elaborate . The game tasks players with rhythmically controlling cute little soldiers called Cobuns, but directing these warriors while avoiding damage is easier said than done. We said it felt like \"the gaming equivalent of patting your head and rubbing your stomach.\" The developer also announced some new features coming to the game. It revealed two new worlds, including a jungle and a garden that's been frozen over, along with new soldier and weapon types. This is 2025, so the game also features a roguelike element, as players can encounter unique power-ups and buffs during each run. There's still a lot we don't know about this title, including the price and when it'll eventually come to gaming consoles. The developer has a livestream planned for September 14 hosted by voice actor Tomokazu Sugita. The stream \"will feature the latest updates, our post-launch roadmap and information on upcoming events.\" Patapon originally came out all the way back in 2007 for the PSP. It was followed by a handful of sequels, all originally for Sony's first portable console. The first two games have been ported to other consoles, including the Switch and PS5 .

While the Omen Max 45L (pricing still TBA) features a similar design to the existing Omen 35L , HP's latest flagship desktop should bring even more beastly performance without sacrificing on cooling or noise levels. The key to this is a new case featuring what the company is calling the industry's first patented Cryo Chamber, which puts the PC's liquid-cooled radiator in a separate compartment to prevent hot air from spreading and impacting the rest of the system's thermals. With this arrangement, HP says it was able to reduce temperatures by up to 7.5 degrees Celsius at full load. Meanwhile, thanks to smaller touches like raised feet, vented PCI slots and open vents on the bottom of the case, HP was able to improve GPU temps by another two degrees C. But to me, the best thing about the Omen Max 45L is that HP says it's using industry-standard components across the board instead of proprietary parts and fittings like we sometimes see in pre-built systems from major vendors. This means that down the line, if you want to replace or upgrade a specific component, you'll be able to do just that instead of potentially needing to replace the entire computer. And if that isn't enough, the Omen comes with a CPU cooler that has a small built-in display that you can load up with practically any image or short video clip. Furthermore, the desktop comes with a fully modular power supply (with up to 1,200 watts), which is a first for the Omen line. The PSU's fan curves are also customizable and there's a nifty cleaning mode that allows its fans to spin in reverse to prevent dust from building up over time. Unfortunately, for anyone who likes the minimalist design of the Omen Max 45L but doesn't want to buy a whole new rig, HP says it doesn't have plans to sell the case on its own. Naturally, as the beefiest desktop in HP's gaming desktop family, the Omen Max 45L can be configured with top-of-the-line components including up to an AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D processor, an NVIDIA RTX 5090 GPU, 128GB of DDR5 RAM and 2TB of PCIe Gen5 storage. Sam Rutherford for Engadget Aside from the Omen Max 45L, HP also has a bunch of refreshed PC gaming peripherals on the way, headlined by the $300 HyperX Cloud Alpha 2 wireless headset. Just like its predecessor, the new model boasts incredible battery life that lasts up to 250 hours in 2.4GHz mode, 53mm drivers and support for dual audio inputs via Bluetooth. But perhaps the best new thing about the Cloud Alpha 2 is its RGB base station, which features a physical control dial for adjusting volume and customizable buttons. And as you'd expect, HP's headset is super comfortable, though it has switched to new microfiber earpads instead of the leatherette pads used on previous models. Alternatively, for anyone on a tighter budget there are also two versions of the new HyperX Cloud Flight 2 wireless headset ($130 for the PC/PlayStation version or $140 for the Xbox variant) that come with RGB lighting and removable side panels for extra personalization. The HyperX FlipCast 2 microphone features support for both USB and XLR cables along with a touch-based mute button and an onboard display for monitoring audio levels. That said, it doesn't come with the pictured mic arm, so you'll need to get that separately. Sam Rutherford for Engadget Finally, for folks in the market for a new desktop mic, HP has two offerings there as well: the $230 HyperX FlipCast and the $60 SoloCast 2. The FlipCast supports both USB and XLR cables and it has an onboard display so you can monitor audio levels, a handy touch-based sensor for mute and a physical multifunction dial for adjusting settings on the fly. Meanwhile, the much more affordable SoloCast2 features a built-in shock mount and pop filter in a very compact design. Sam Rutherford for Engadget Sadly, the Omen Max 45L and the HyperX CloudX Flight 2 headset won't be available until the end of the year in December. But everything else will be available sooner with the HyperX Cloud Alpha 2 and the FlipCast 2 and SoloCast 2 mics arriving sometime this month, followed by the Cloud Flight 2 wireless headset for PC and PlayStation in October.

When enabled, the chatbot would, following a question, try to guide the user to their own solution, instead of providing them with an answer outright. Since its introduction in April, learning mode has only been available to Claude for Education users. Now, like OpenAI did with Study Mode , Anthropic is making the tool available to everyone. Starting today, Claude.ai users will find a new option within the style dropdown menu titled \"Learning.\" The experience here is similar to the one Anthropic offers with Claude for Education . When you turn learning mode on, the chatbot will employ a Socratic approach, trying to guide you through your question. However, unlike the real-life Socrates, who was famous for bombarding strangers with endless questions, you can turn off learning mode at any time. Notably, Anthropic is also offering two different takes on the feature through Claude Code . First, there's an \"Explanatory\" mode where Claude will generate summaries of its decision-making process as it works, giving the user a chance to better understand what it's doing. For those at the start of their coding career or hobby, there's also a more robust option, which is once again called \"Learning.\" Here, Claude will occasionally stop what it's doing and mark a section with a \"#TODO\" comment to prompt the user to write five to 10 lines of their code. If you want to try the two features out for yourself, update to the latest version of Claude Code and type \"/output-styles.\" You can then select between the two modes or Claude's default behavior. According to Drew Bent, education lead at Anthropic, learning mode, particularly as it exists in Claude Code, is the company's attempt to make its chatbot into more of a collaborative tool. \"I think it's great that there's a race between all of the AI labs to offer the best learning mode,\" he said. \"In a similar way, I hope we can inspire something similar with coding agents.\" Bent says the original learning mode came out of conversations Anthropic had with university students, who kept referring back to the concept of brain rot . \"We found that they themselves realized that when they just copy and paste something directly from a chat bot, it's not good for their long-term learning,\" he said. When it came time to adapt the feature to Claude Code, the company wanted to balance the needs of new programmers with those like Bent who have been coding for a decade or more. \"Learning mode is designed to help all of those audiences not just complete tasks, but also help them grow and learn in the process and better understand their code base,\" Bent said. His hope is that the new tools will allow any coder to become a \"really good engineering manager.\" In practice, that means those users won't necessarily write most of the code on a project, but they will develop a keen eye for how everything fits together and what sections of code might need some more work. Looking forward, Bent says Anthropic doesn't \"have all the answers, but needless to say, we're trying to think through other features we can build\" that expand on what it's doing with learning mode. To that end, the company is opening up Claude Code's new Output Styles to developers, allowing them to build their own learning modes. Users too can modify how Claude communicates by creating their own custom prompts for the chatbot .

Gamescom is the planet's largest gaming event and we're sure to find out about a bunch of interesting new games at the Opening Night Live showcase (and, fingers crossed, maybe get a Hollow Knight: Silksong release date?). Xbox is broadcasting from the show floor across two days, and there will be other presentations that are worth keeping an eye on. Gamescom is taking place between August 20 and 24 this year, and we're learning bits and pieces about what to expect from the various showcases. The affair will kick off with Opening Night Live, a showcase hosted by Geoff Keighley that bridges the gap between his two other major events, Summer Game Fest Live and The Game Awards. That will be followed by two days of Xbox broadcasts, the latest edition of the Future Games Show and three days of Bethesda streams. There will also be news from Ubisoft on what's next for The Division 2 . The company will host two panels related to the franchise during Gamescom. One will include more info about The Division Resurgence ( a delayed mobile game ), as well details about a \"big Division 2 project.\" We'll update this preview with more Gamescom details as we get them, and embed video versions of each stream as they become available too. Here's our breakdown of how to watch Gamescom 2025 and what to expect from the event. Gamescom schedule Opening Night Live — August 19, 1:30PM ET (pre-show), 2PM (main show) Xbox @ gamescom 2025 Broadcast — August 20, 9AM ET Future Games Show — August 20, 2PM ET Xbox @ gamescom 2025 Broadcast — August 21, 9AM ET Bethesda — August 22-25 How to watch Gamescom Opening Night Live - August 19, 2PM ET Watch on YouTube Opening Night Live perhaps won't feature as many heavy hitters as Summer Game Fest Live or The Game Awards typically have, but one thing's for certain: Call of Duty fans will definitely want to tune in. The two-hour showcase will feature the \"worldwide reveal\" of Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. We'll almost certainly get a release date here too. Given that Microsoft has said Hollow Knight: Silksong will be playable on PC and ROG Xbox Ally X at its Gamescom booth, and the game is still slated to arrive this year, this event seems as good a time as any for us to finally get a release date for that thing — over six years after we first got to try it out . There will certainly be more eyeballs on ONL than Microsoft's own streams, so that seems like the likeliest bet for any concrete Silksong news at Gamescom. You can also expect a trailer for multiplayer RPG Honor of Kings: World, along with new looks at Resident Evil Requiem, Silent Hill f, Ninja Gaiden 4, Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion and The Seven Deadly Sins: Origin. You'll get to see the opening cinematic for World of Warcraft 's Midnight expansion as well. It won't all be game reveals and announcements, though — there'll be a performance of music from Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 featuring composer Lorien Testard and vocalist Alice Duport-Percier. Additionally, you'll get a peek at season two of Prime Video's Fallout series, which will arrive in December. We'll be keeping tabs on all the news from Opening Night Live right here on Engadget. Myself, senior editor Jess Conditt and editor-in-chief Aaron Souppouris will be live-blogging our way through ONL. Join us! It should be fun. How to watch Xbox @ gamescom 2025 Day 1 Broadcast — August 20, 9AM ET Watch on YouTube , Twitch , TikTok or Facebook One major piece of news we're likely to get from Xbox during one of its streams (if it isn't revealed at ONL beforehand) is the release date and pricing for the ASUS ROG Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X handheld systems. Leaker billbil-kun has reported the devices will arrive on October 16, at least in Europe, costing €599 for the Xbox Ally and €899 for the higher-end Xbox Ally X. Microsoft had already confirmed these handhelds would be available in time for the holiday season, so that rumored release date makes sense. Either way, we should get confirmation during Gamescom of when to expect these devices, especially since the company says it will discuss the handhelds during its August 20 stream. This particular event will feature the likes of Grounded 2, Keeper and Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 . The Order of Giants , an expansion for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, will be showcased alongside Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade, Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, Dying Light: The Beast, World of Warcraft: Midnight, Hotel Barcelona, Invincible Vs., Cronos: The New Dawn, Outbound, Powerwash Simulator 2 and Starsand Island. Along with the English-language broadcast, Xbox's streams will be available in other languages on regional Xbox channels on the likes of YouTube, Twitch, TikTok and Facebook.

As spotted by 9to5Google , the company is making Sensitive Content Warnings more broadly available after beta testing the option since April . Google announced it last October. The feature can detect and blur images that include nudity. However, it’ll only work if you’re signed into a Google Account in the Messages app. When Messages detects and blurs such an image, you will be able to choose between several actions. You can access a resource page called \"Learn why nude images can be harmful,\" block the sender’s number, return to the main Messages screen or opt to dismiss or view the image (tap Next and then either \"No, don’t view\" or \"Yes, view\"). A warning will appear when you go to send or forward a nude image too. Your device will remind you of the risk of doing so and you will have to acknowledge confirmation before you send the image. Sensitive Content Warnings is enabled by default for supervised users and parents and guardians can manage it via the Family Link app. Unsupervised teens aged between 13 and 17 can switch off the feature from their Google Account settings. Adults will have to opt in if they want to use the feature. They can do so by going to Google Messages Settings > Protection & Safety > Manage sensitive content warnings > Warnings in Google Messages. Google has designed this feature with privacy in mind. Your device will process and classify the images locally with the help of Android System SafetyCore tools. No identifiable data, classified content or results associated with this safety feature (including any detected nude images) are sent to Google servers, the company says . Google also notes that the feature isn't perfect — it may occasionally incorrectly determine that an image contains nudity when it doesn't, or allow ones that do feature nudity to pass through undetected.

What does that mean for my current Windows 10 PC, and what are my options? A: Microsoft will officially end support for Windows 10 on October 14, 2025, a little over 10 years after the operating system was released. While you can continue to use Windows 10 PCs after that date — and it's understandable why, I gave it a glowing review at launch — you'll no longer receive any customer support, security updates or any other sort of upgrades. Windows 10 will effectively become a zombie operating system, shuffling along until some sort of malware or massive security breach renders it far too insecure. (Think about it this way: Would you actually feel safe running Windows XP, a notoriously malware-prone OS that hasn't received a significant security update since 2019, today? I would hope not!) So what's a Windows 10 user to do? Let's consider your choices. The best option: Upgrade to Windows 11 For most users, the simplest way to move on from Windows 10 is to step up to Microsoft's new OS. Windows 11 is a free upgrade for Windows 10 users running the latest 22HS update and who also meet the minimum hardware specifications . Microsoft isn't asking for much — just a 1 GHz dual-core 64-bit processor, 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage -— but security requirements may be a problem for very old PCs. Those include the ability to launch in Secure Boot mode , as well as having a TPM 2.0 (Trusted Platform 2.0) module. Windows 11 relies on the latter for biometric logins, BitLocker data encryption and other security features. If you don't have TPM 2.0, you'll be stuck with Windows 10 until you get a new PC. If that all sounds too complicated, Microsoft's PC Health Check app can also let you know if your system is ready for Windows 11. And if you've been bombarded by Windows 11 upgrade notifications over the past few years, that's also a not-so-subtle nudge that your PC is likely ready for the new OS. (There are various hacks that can let you install Windows 11 without TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot, but they’re risky and could make your OS installation vulnerable.) If you do choose to upgrade, you can expect a relatively painless process. Gone are the days when a Windows upgrade could easily wipe out your entire system. Now you can expect all of your software (and their respective licenses) to carry over, but with yet another caveat for Office suites: Microsoft is also ending support for Office 2016 and Office 2019 on October 14, 2025 as well. Cloud-based Microsoft 365 apps should be good to go on Windows 11 as well (see below for Windows 10 limitations). Assuming you've got enough hard drive space to hold the new OS, the upgrade process is merely a matter of sitting back and watching your system reboot a few times. I'd still recommend backing up any essential data before upgrading, though, just in case you run into any issues. (Pairing a cloud-based Microsoft OneDrive backup with a local hard disk is a good belt and suspenders solution.) The pricey option: Buy a new PC If your system is too old to support Secure Boot mode and TPM 2.0, it’s probably just time for an upgrade. (Expert users can find workarounds on YouTube and elsewhere, but you need to be adventurous enough to handle the likes of Github downloads and security overrides.) Luckily, we’ve got a slew of buying guides to help you out. Be sure to check out our best laptop guide , which includes some tips on the best specs to seek out, as well as some of our favorite systems like the Dell 14 Premium and MacBook Air (because it’s also a good time to consider switching from Windows to Macs ). Our best Windows laptops guide also highlights systems like the ASUS ZenBook S14 and the Surface Pro Copilot+ tablet . While the sweetspot for new PCs tends to be in the $750 to $1,200 range, with current back-to-school promos, you can find very capable laptops and desktops for as low as $500, and occasionally less. But if you're looking for something higher end ($1,400 and up), our best gaming laptop guide would be helpful. The risky option: Keep on trucking with Windows 10 Windows 10 won't self-destruct when its support ends, so you could conceivably just use your older PC until it dies. But that's a risky option since you won't be getting any security updates. All it takes is for one intrepid hacker to find a new security flaw and you could easily fall victim to any number of issues. That includes getting malware, which could slow down performance and leak your data to hackers, or falling victim to a ransomware data theft scheme. And every day past October 14 just raises the likelihood of OS-level vulnerabilities that third-party antivirus software would be ill-equipped to fight off. Trust me – you don't want to do this. At the very least, buy yourself another year to figure things out The procrastinator option: Extend Windows 10's security updates for one year If your hardware can't support the move to Windows 11, you can at least hit the snooze button by subscribing to the Windows 10 extended update (ESU) program. While it was initially announced as a $30 offering, Microsoft has since made it a free option if you synchronize your Windows 10 settings to the cloud via Windows Backup, or you could shell out 1,000 Microsoft reward points . As its name implies, the ESU will get you Windows 10 security updates, bug fixes and technical support until October 13, 2026. It also extends support for cloud-based Microsoft 365 apps through August 2026 for individuals and families. Sure, it's only a year of additional support, but that can at least buy you enough time to do more research on a new PC, or wait for a holiday sale. For what it's worth, this marks the first time Microsoft has offered any sort of ESU to consumers. Typically, they're just a way for corporate IT admins to get additional support without migrating to a new OS. Have a tech question you’d like Engadget to answer?

In a post on its newsroom website , the company says the feature will roll out to Apple Watch Series 9, Series 10, and Watch Ultra 2 users through a joint Apple Watch and iPhone update. Once Apple begins rolling out the software, you'll need to update your devices to iOS 18.6.1 and watchOS 11.6.1 to access the reworked feature. Following the update, any blood oxygen data captured by your Apple Watch will be calculated on your iPhone, with the resulting data viewable in the respiratory section of the Health app. \"There will be no impact to Apple Watch units previously purchased that include the original Blood Oxygen feature, nor to Apple Watch units purchased outside of the US,\" Apple said. Today's update marks another unexpected development in Apple's long, drawn out legal feud with Masimo. In 2021, the medical device maker sued Apple , alleging the tech giant had infringed on its intellectual properties related to pulse oximeter blood-oxygen monitoring technology. Following a couple of years of legal back and forth, the issue came to a head when the US International Trade Commission (ITC) upheld a prior ruling that found Apple had violated Masimo's patents. After former President Biden chose not to veto the decision, Apple was forced to temporarily pause sales of the Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2. The company later started selling the wearables again following an update the removed the infringing blood oxygen monitoring feature. Now Apple says it's able to offer the functionality again, with a slight modification, due to a recent US Customs ruling.

That was my immediate thought when the company announced its first drone, the A1, from a spin-off brand and team called Antigravity . So, what is the A1? Is it an entry-level device? A camera for creators looking to spice up their videos without years of practice? A competitive POV drone? It’s a bit of all three, but the Antigravity A1 isn’t just a drone. It will eventually launch in a three-part set: the flying unit, OLED Vision goggles and a dedicated Grip motion controller. In its current form, the Antigravity A1 weighs around 249 grams (8.8 ounces), which helps it duck around drone license requirements in most regions. (As it’s a preproduction model, this could change a little before it hits retail.) Two ultrawide cameras are positioned on the roof and underside of the drone instead of on the front. It’s like the Insta360 X5 camera is some sort of cocoon for the Antigravity A1. Image by Mat Smith for Engadget With those two camera units, the A1 can capture video in 8K resolution, stretched across a sphere-like canvas from the drone’s point of view. With stitching algorithms that the company has continually improved over five generations of 360-degree cameras, this should result in mostly seamless footage where the A1 never interrupts the view. The drone itself won’t show up in your video. It’s like the company’s “invisible” selfie stick, but, well, up in the sky. The A1 is unlike any other drone I’ve played with — something I learned when I tested a pre-production unit at a Mercedes-Benz race track in Schlüsselfeld, Germany. Naturally, this included high-speed cars, wet conditions and some near-misses. Thanks to working at Engadget, I’m a drone dabbler, but Antigravity’s A1 is a different experience from the outset. Controlling the A1 involves strapping on companion goggles and steering it from a first-person perspective, controller in hand. However, unlike other FPV drones, you can look (and move) anywhere you want. During roughly 15 minutes of flying time (you can see the highlights here), I found it’s a surprisingly intuitive experience. With other FPV drones, your view is locked to the direction of the camera. Sure, you can rotate rival drones to see elsewhere, like with DJI’s Avata , but it’s not the same. Because the A1 streams 360-degree video to the goggles, turning your head will never affect the direction it’s facing. Instead, you’ll just see what’s around the drone as it flies, making it far more intuitive for rookie drone pilots. Better still, you can strafe and move around while looking somewhere else — like video game controls for a first-person shooter. This freedom of movement is elevated by the unique A1 controller, which is best described as a blend between a traditional drone controller and a Wiimote. While some of the physical buttons and dials adjust altitude, start/stop video recording and more, steering involves a point-and-click method. When you move your hand out to the right side, a reticle shows up on the goggles’ display. Pressing the trigger then will cause the A1 to shoot out in that direction, an action that Antigravity calls Freemotion control. As I mentioned, this means I don’t have to look where I’m going — although it’s better if I do to avoid accidents (or collisions with an expensive Mercedes). If you’ve been intrigued by FPV drones, this is a simpler experience that feels freer, too. You can look wherever you want, not beholden to where cameras are pointed on other drones. I also think I could get friends and family flying the A1 around with minimal training. Speaking of spectators, Insta360 included a clever touch for them: the goggles have an external screen so that onlookers can see what’s happening. There is nothing duller than watching someone else fly a drone without being able to see their POV. Image by Mat Smith for Engadget The A1 is a zippy little drone, presumably thanks to its low weight. But even at this preproduction stage, the resulting video looks better than I thought it would. Plus, it offers substantial versatility if you’re looking for action-packed shots. After I tested the A1, Antigravity sent me my video from the drone, so I was about to reframe, crop and reposition the footage. You could even use the same 10 seconds and frame (or crop) to three very different angles. For example, you could extract a tracking shot of the car, a zoomed-in shot of the drone pilot or just the blue skies of Germany all from one clip. That’s the exciting part here. Insta360 built excellent editing tools (mobile and desktop) for its cameras in the past, and it plans to do the same for its first drone. An early version of the software wasn’t without its hiccups, but editing was easy enough once I figured out that keyframes would anchor the drone's view. I could then add several keyframes together, tagging objects I’d like to keep in frame or track. Editing my footage started to get oddly enjoyable, and I have never enjoyed that task. Another feature the company emphasized is payload detection. While the exact weight limit is still being refined through further testing, Antigravity says the A1 won’t be able to fly if the drone detects it’s carrying something it shouldn’t — a move to further smooth potential license issues. The company also hinted at future accessories and peripherals to expand the A1 experience — something it has successfully done with its action cams and gimbals. Image by Mat Smith for Engadget Some specs are still a mystery because the drone is a work in progress. To that end, the company is opening up applications for a co-creation project, where participants will get a pre-production Antigravity A1 in exchange for offering feedback. Ideas from these testers will be integrated into the final retail version, and the best ones could win a share of a $20,000 prize pool. Flying the A1 around a racetrack was the most fun I've had with a drone in a long time. But, with goggles and a dedicated controller included, how much will a flight cost? That might decide whether Insta360’s Antigravity can carve out a place next to DJI’s army of drones.

While some discounts are reserved for students, others are available to everyone. One of the best right now is on Apple's M3-powered iPad Air , which is somewhat of a goldilocks tablet — one that will be a great option for just about everyone. You can grab it for $150 off at Amazon right now. This deal applies to each configuration of the 11-inch and 13-inch versions of the most recent iPad Air. So, the 11-inch model is as low as $449, while the 13-inch model is down to $649. The same deals can be found at Best Buy and Target if you prefer to shop somewhere other than Amazon. This is an all-time low price and beats the deal we saw on Prime Day by $30. The iPad Air M3 is more of an iterative refresh than a grand overhaul, but the spec bump means it’ll last you a long time before the tablet’s performance becomes a problem. This iPad occupies the position of \"best for most\" in our iPad buying guide , reinforcing that goldilocks analogy. The M3 chip is the main draw here, with Geekbench 6 scores proclaiming it around 16 percent more powerful than the M2 iPad Air, which is no slouch itself. Beyond the chip, it has a superior display and speakers to the entry-level model , and wider accessory support. You also get the option of a 13-inch display, which is great for artists or anyone who sees the iPad as a viable laptop replacement. If there’s an obvious downside to the iPad Air M3, it’s that it doesn't have the nice 120Hz OLED display of the iPad Pro. This is hardly surprising, as Apple often focuses on display tech to differentiate its Pro and non-Pro devices, but it’s probably time the refresh rate on the middle-of-the-road iPad at least jumped up to ProMotion. Face ID is long overdue too. If you can live with these caveats, though, the iPad Air is an excellent option, particularly at this price. There are a couple of other iPads on sale at Amazon right now, too, if you think the Air is too much for your needs. The iPad A16 , Apple's entry-level tablet, is down to $299, while the latest iPad mini is on sale for $399. Both models were slightly cheaper during Prime Day in July, but these discounts are still worth considering if you're looking to pick up a newer iPad for less.

As The Verge notes, Rebirth is the parent of ReCycles, the prominent French manufacturer that took over bike assembly for Cowboy back in February. For quite some time, the company's fate was up in the air. Cowboy explained that over the past couple of years, it has been hit by several problems that are plaguing the whole industry, including the post-COVID shifts in the demand for e-bikes and massive supply chain problems. On top of those, it had to launch a recall for some of its Cruiser ST bikes when their frames started to crack after 2,500 kilometers (1,553 miles), which Cowboy said \"added strain to an already difficult time.\" It explained that the issue was caused by one of its suppliers making an unauthorized change to the bikes. Cowboy has admitted that due to the issues it faced, customers experienced a lot of delays and that it wasn't able to communicate things with them clearly. Now that it has secured financing, the first replacement frames for the recalled bikes have finally arrived from its supplier and it was able to start operating its first recall center, with more to follow in the summer. \"We are not yet where we want to be, but we are here,\" the company said in the email it has sent its customers. \"Still standing.

The Vive Eagle is a rival to Meta's Ray-Ban glasses with a fashion-foward lightweight design, open ear audio, voice-activated AI and an ultra-wide AI-powered camera. They look promising, if a bit expensive, but will only be available in Taiwan to start with. The Taiwanese firm clearly noticed that Meta's Ray-Ban smart glasses have been a surprise hit. It's easy to see why — in our Engadget review , we found that they look great and perform admirably. The current model includes in-ear speakers, cameras, microphones and access to Meta’s virtual assistant. HTC has used much the same formula for the Vive Eagle, though they have an uphill battle against Ray-Ban's brand brand in terms of consumer awareness and style. \"Vive Eagle features a refined aesthetic that conceals its powerful technology in clean, minimalist lines,\" the company wrote. It managed to fit all the technology into a relatively lightweight frame that weighs just 49 grams, only a gram heavier than Meta's Ray-Bans. HTC On the camera side, the Vive Eagle comes with a 12MP ultra-wide model with voice-activated AI, offering support for multiple platforms including OpenAI and Gemini. \"With a simple voice command like 'Hey VIVE, take a photo,; users can capture what they see — right from their glasses,\" the company wrote. Voice commands also let you do things like record reminders, take notes, and get restaurant recommendations. You can also get real-time translation in 13 languages: Arabic, Traditional Chinese, English, French, German, Greek, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese, Spanish, Korean, Thai, Turkish. On the audio side, the Vive Eagle has an open-ear setup that \"combines large acoustic drivers and virtual bass enhancement to deliver rich, spatial audio while minimizing sound leakage,\" HTC said. It promised that you'll be able to hear music or voice prompts without others overhearing, while still being aware of your surroundings. HTC promises up to 36 hours of standby time and 4.5 hours of continuous music playback thanks to the 235mAh battery, and you can get to a 50 percent charge (via magnetic fast charging) in just 10 minutes. It also features a \"privacy-first\" architecture with all video and other data stored exclusively on-device — and that is protected via 256-bit AES encryption, according to HTC. The Vive Eagle will only available in Taiwan at first for NT$15,600, or about $520 — quite a bit more than most of Meta's Ray-Ban models. HTC has yet to say if it will bring the Vive Eagle to other territories including the US — but if it does and at that price, it'll be in tough against its rival.

This year's shindig could see the thinnest iPhone to date joining the iPhone 17 lineup. Also on tap could be new Apple Watch models — including the first Ultra model in two years — and (maybe) the long-awaited AirPods Pro 3. Apple's iPhone family will likely welcome a new member this year. The iPhone Air is expected to be roughly 5.55 mm thick. The thinnest model so far has been 2014's iPhone 6 , at 6.9 mm. And they've only gotten chunkier since then. (The iPhone 16 Pro has a depth of 8.25 mm.) So, the Air would stand out from its peers in that respect. It would also give Apple a direct rival to Samsung's Galaxy S25 Edge, which we found to be more than a gimmick . But the iPhone Air's thin design will likely lead to some compromises. It's rumored to have only a single 48 MP camera and a smaller battery. So, expect a stylish phone that... won't be for everyone. Brian Oh for Engadget The Pro lineup could offer some design tweaks and performance improvements. The iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max are rumored to switch from titanium to aluminum. They could also see the rear camera array expand to an entire \"island\" that extends across most of the phone's backside. It's expected to house three cameras (as before), but multiple rumors have suggested it will have an improved telephoto one. The zoom lens could jump to 48MP, which would strengthen its digital zooming / cropping chops. The phones may also add an anti-glare coating, similar to those found on iPads . The standard iPhone 17 could see some welcome display upgrades. At least one supply chain source claimed it will add a 120Hz variable refresh rate (ProMotion) display, which the Pro series has used since 2021 . Apple One thing we know without a doubt is that the new iPhones will launch with iOS 26, which brings Apple's biggest design refresh in years . It's easy to imagine the company highlighting the new model's displays as the best way to experience the new Liquid Glass visual language. As for the naming scheme, there haven't been any leaks pointing to a similar hardware rebranding (\"iPhone 26,\" \"iPhone 26 Pro,\" etc.). But hey, Apple does like surprises. Engadget's iPhone 17 rumor roundup gives you a deeper dive into what to expect from the new models. Cherlynn Low for Engadget Apple's fall event isn't just for iPhones. The company is also expected to roll out new Apple Watch models. 5G and a processor upgrade are expected for the Apple Watch Ultra 3. It may also let you send texts via satellite, handy for those who use it out in the wilderness. Regardless of the details, Apple hasn't launched a new rugged and premium model since 2023 (apart from a new color ), so it's due for an upgrade. The Series 11 model is unlikely to depart dramatically from the Series 10. After all, that model introduced a new design, with a thinner body and larger screen . (And Apple has historically kept those around in three-year cycles.). But a faster chip also seems logical. Perhaps we'll see 5G arrive on the standard wearable, too. We may also see the AirPods Pro 3 at the event. It's been about three years since Apple last upgraded its premium earbuds. The new model could also bring some biometric sensors to the earphones : an in-ear heart-rate monitor and (maybe) temperature sensing. Live translation is also rumored , although that may not be exclusive to the third-gen model.

Whether you want a lightweight device to binge your favorite shows, a larger screen for mobile gaming or a portable way to get some work done on the go, a tablet can do it all. They’re also great for keeping kids entertained, managing work tasks or sharing family moments through video calls. When a phone feels too small and lugging around a laptop is just too much, that’s where tablets fit into the mix. For many, the Apple iPad is the go-to choice, and it’s easy to see why with its smooth performance and endless app options. But don’t worry if iOS isn’t your thing — there are plenty of Android alternatives out there, offering the same level of flexibility without locking you into Apple’s ecosystem. Plus, if you’re on a budget, there are more affordable options that still pack a punch. Whether you’re looking for a premium tablet for work, a kid-friendly device with parental controls or just a reliable everyday companion, we’ve tested all of the big players (and many others) to find the best tablets worth your money right now. Table of contents Best tablets for 2025 Important things to consider before buying a tablet How we test tablets Other tablets we tested Tablet FAQs Tablet accessories Best tablets for 2025 Important things to consider before buying a tablet Before you start looking at specific devices, the number one thing you should do is figure out what you plan to use your new tablet for. That’s because if all you need is something to keep a kid busy, buying a brand new Apple iPad Air or iPad Pro doesn’t make a ton of sense. On the flip side, if you want to use a tablet for video editing or drawing, you’ll need to take things like performance, versatility and stylus support more seriously — especially if you're considering using it as a laptop replacement. You’ll also want to think about stuff like how often you plan on traveling with the device and if it’s more for productivity, or for less demanding stuff like web browsing or streaming shows. There’s also an important trade-off to consider when it comes to battery life as well. Larger devices tend to have longer runtimes, though an increase in size may make it less portable. How we test tablets When evaluating different tablets, there are a few important things we look for above all else: solid performance, a good screen and long battery life. For performance, we run a handful of synthetic tests like Geekbench 6, while also performing a number of hands-on, real-world use cases such as editing photos and playing games. And with tablets often serving as hybrid devices, we also consider how easy it is to multitask and switch quickly between various apps. The more responsive a device feels, the better. Because a tablet’s display is such a critical component, we also view a wide range of content to gauge things like brightness, color gamut and dynamic range. It’s important to take into account the difference between various panel types like OLED, which typically produce richer colors and excellent contrast but may not be as bright as a mini LED display. Recently, refresh rate has become an increasingly important spec as 90Hz and 120Hz screens can make scrolling smoother and graphics appear sharper in games. We also consider a tablet’s design (including things like size, weight and water resistance), its connectivity (WiFi, Bluetooth, NFC, 5G, et cetera) and special features like stylus support or the ability to serve as a secondary display. That’s because, while tablets were often viewed as content consumption devices in the past, higher-end devices like the Surface Pro and iPad Pro are more than capable of replacing a laptop for a lot of people. Finally, we test battery life by running our standard local video rundown test, which involves playing a single video on a loop from 100 percent until it runs out of juice. Ideally, a tablet should be able to last an entire working day, but longer runtimes are always welcome — especially for users relying on them for productivity, entertainment and storage options on the go. Other tablets we tested Apple iPad mini Apple updated the iPad mini for 2024 with some under-the-hood changes including a new processor and additional RAM to help support Apple Intelligence features. While the iPad mini is one of the best iPads you can buy, its small size makes it a bit niche. Only if you prefer your tablet be the size of an ereader should you consider this one. Google Pixel Tablet The Google Pixel Tablet excels as a smart display rather than a simple tablet. As the latter, it's unexciting, but when paired with its speaker/charging dock, it becomes much more useful. It could be a good option for those that already live within the Google ecosystem and use the Google Assistant often, or those who like the idea of a tablet that can be docked and used as a smart display as well. OnePlus Pad The solid OnePlus Pad is let down by Android because there aren't many Android apps designed to be used on a large display like this model's 11.6-inch panel. Otherwise, the hardware is well-designed, its companion stylus is comfortable to use and it has an excellent battery life. Tablet FAQs What is the best brand for tablets? The best brand for tablets is really the brand you feel most comfortable with. We recommend taking stock of the gadgets you already have — do you live in the Apple ecosystem already? An iPad might be best for you then. Do you have a Samsung phone? If so, a Galaxy Tab will likely be the most convenient choice. There is no one \"best brand\" for tablets; you’ll find good options made by companies including Apple, Google, Samsung, Microsoft and Amazon. Can a tablet replace a laptop? It’s possible for a tablet to replace a laptop, but you’ll need a few accessories to truly make the experience as close as possible to that of a traditional notebook. A keyboard is a must, be it a keyboard case or a Bluetooth accessory that you keep with you. Some keyboard cases, like apple’s Magic Keyboard for the iPad, have a built-in trackpad, which will be more ergonomic than tapping on your tablet’s screen for input. Additionally, you could go one step further and use a wireless mouse that connects via Bluetooth to your tablet. If you’re primarily looking for a tablet to replace your laptop, consider buying a 2-in-1 laptop since those systems typically consist of high-powered tablets that are designed to work well with (and without) keyboards. What size screen do I need? Figuring out the best screen size for you will also be related to the kind of work (or play) you intend to do. Larger screens make it much easier to view two apps side by side, and big screens also deliver a more immersive movie viewing experience — especially when paired with an OLED display or Liquid Retina display. But at the same time, the larger the tablet, the less likely you’re going to want to move it around. That means you’re not only going to want to take stock of your workspace (i.e., if you have a desk or instead plan to work from a couch or even your bed), but you’re also going to want to think about how the device will fit into your everyday routine or commute (if you have one). Tablet accessories Finally, you’ll want to consider any add-ons or accessories you’re planning to use, which can range from detachable keyboards to things like external mics or a stylus. The good news is that many of the best tablets nowadays offer some kind of keyboard accessory, which allows the device to function more like a 2-in-1 instead of simply being a content consumption device. Some tablets also feature things like microSD card slots that support expandable storage, or optional 4G or 5G connectivity, which can be a real boon to frequent travelers. And if you’re planning to use the tablet mainly for work, you might want to grab a USB hub for connecting all your favorite peripherals so your devices don’t have to fight for the charger.

(Apple) Next month, we'll finally get the option to download iOS 26 on our iPhones ( screenshots are way better in the latest operating system!). Until then, you can download and install the newly released public beta 2 (or iOS 26 developer beta 6 for developers). During Apple's recent earnings call, CEO Tim Cook said its collection of upcoming beta operating systems (including iOS) are \"by far the most popular developer betas we’ve had,\" 9to5Mac reports . You can also take a look at our preview of the iOS 26 public beta release , which shows off the fresh home and lock screen redesign. Called Liquid Glass , the new translucent look will extend across all of Apple's upcoming operating systems. The overhaul is one of several big changes coming to iOS, macOS , iPadOS and the rest of Apple's software suite, all of which were showcased during the company's WWDC keynote on June 9. After overpromising on AI plans last year, Apple kept its iOS roadmap focused more on basic quality of life improvements this year. There are multiple useful additions coming to the Phone and Messages apps on your iPhone, for instance: Apple execs outlined the ability to weed out spam texts or other unknown senders and an option to hold your spot on a phone call when you've been waiting for a representative to pick up. Plus, a treasured feature that we took for granted is coming back (hint: it's in the Photos app). Siri, meanwhile, is in a holding pattern. Apple has previously specified that its smarter voice assistant — first promised at WWDC 2024 — is delayed until some point \" in the coming year ,\" so you shouldn't expect any major changes in the current betas. But there are reports that Apple is aiming to give Siri a bigger brain transplant by basing it on third-party artificial intelligence models like OpenAI's ChatGPT or Anthropic's Claude, which could make 2026 a pivotal year. The company is also reportedly working on a 'stripped-down' AI chatbot to rival ChatGPT. With each beta, it seems like additional new improvements are popping up, like this new AirPods gesture we're all curious about, and this FaceTime feature that'll freeze your video if it detects nudity . With the release of the iOS 26 developer beta 5 , we saw more added features, like a new bouncy animation on the passcode screen and in the Control Center, MacRumors reports . Some or all of those changes will likely soon migrate into the separate public beta (see below). Most newer iPhone models are eligible to download iOS 26 (both the betas and final version). Want to see the full list of new features coming this fall? Read on. What is iOS 26? The current iPhone operating system is iOS 18, and Apple is still actively updating it — version 18.6 was just recently released. But don't expect to see iOS 19. Instead, Apple is skipping the numbering ahead to iOS 26 later this year. The company has decided to line up its iOS version numbers with a year-based system, similar to car model years. So while iOS and its sibling operating systems will be released in late 2025, they're all designated \"26\" to reflect the year ahead. It's official, we're moving to iOS 26. (Apple) What is Liquid Glass design? Let's be honest. Out of everything announced at WWDC this year, the new Liquid Glass design was the star of the show. The iPhone's home and lock screens have looked pretty much the same year after year — the last exciting thing (in my opinion) was the option to add your own aesthetic to your home screen by customizing your apps and widgets. So seeing the home and lock screens' new facelift is refreshing. So what exactly is Liquid Glass? Apple calls it a \" new translucent material \" since, well, the apps and widgets are clear. However, the screen can still adapt to dark and light modes, depending on surroundings. You'll also notice buttons with a new floating design in several apps, like Phone and Maps. They're designed to be less distracting than the current buttons, but are still easy to see. While the design overhaul has proven to be controversial since its announcement, some — including Engadget's own Devindra Hardawar — like the new direction, even if it's somewhat reminiscent of Microsoft's translucent Windows Vista Aero designs from nearly twenty years ago. That said, as of the release of the iOS 26 beta 2, Apple has already incorporated some user feedback into the design, dialing back the transparency in at least some places. And while it will continue to evolve, Apple users won't be able to escape it: Liquid Glass was designed to make all of Apple's OSes more cohesive. Here's a look at how the translucent aesthetic will look with the new macOS Tahoe 26 on your desktop. What are the new and notable features of iOS 26? iOS 26 has a laundry list of new features. Among the most worthwhile: Phone app redesign: You'll finally be able to scroll through contacts, recent calls and voicemail messages all on one screen. It also comes with a new feature called Hold Assist that'll notify you when an agent comes to the phone so you can avoid the elevator music and continue on with other tasks. Live Translation in Phone, FaceTime and Messages: iOS 26 is bringing the ability to have a conversation via phone call or text message with someone who speaks another language. Live Translation will translate your conversation in real time, which results in some stop-and-go interactions in the examples Apple shared during its presentation. Polls in group chats: Tired of sorting through what seems like hundreds of messages in your group chat? You and your friends will soon be able to create polls in group messages for deciding things like which brunch spot you're eating at or whose car you're taking on a road trip. Filtering unknown senders in Messages: If you haven't received spam texts about unpaid tolls or other citations, you're lucky. For those of us who have, those annoying messages will soon be filtered away in a separate folder. Visual Intelligence: Similar to a reverse Google image search, this new feature will allow you to search for anything that's on your iPhone screen. For instance, if you spot a pair of shoes someone is wearing in an Instagram photo, you can screenshot it and use Visual Intelligence to find those shoes (or similar ones) online. Photos tabs are back: For anyone who's still frustrated with the Photos changes made last year , you'll be happy to know that your tabs are coming back. Library and Collections will have their own separate spaces so you don't have to scroll to infinity to find what you're looking for. FaceTime \"Communication Safety\" feature: A newer addition to iOS 26 appears to be the FaceTime \"Communication Safety\" feature that pauses communications if and when nudity is detected. The feature appears to be a child safety feature that uses on-device detection, thus obviating any cloud-based privacy issues. New lock screen options : The iPhone lock screen gets more customizable in iOS 26, with a cooler clock, 3D wallpaper effects, more widgets and better focus mode options. Apple's Hold Assist will be nifty for those pesky services that put you on hold for 10 or more minutes. (Apple) New changes coming to iPadOS 26 Your iPad isn't getting left behind when it comes to big updates. Here's what's coming this fall. Multitasking and real windowing: When you download the newest update, you'll be able to have multiple apps running on your screen at the same time. Once you open an app, it'll appear on your screen as normal but you'll be able to resize and move it across your screen to make room for other apps. This feature is optional so you can turn it off if you don't like it. Visual update: Along with the other new OSes, iPadOS 26 is coming with the Liquid Glass aesthetic. This new look will appear on the lock and home screens, as well as the drop-down menus. New menu bar: When you swipe down on your screen, the new menu bar will appear with options like File, Edit, Windows and more. There's also a search option if you're looking for something specific. Check out our first impressions of iPadOS 26 . What about AirPods? AirPods are also getting updated with iOS 26. Here are some of the more notable functions. Enhanced audio recording: Apple calls this \"studio-quality\" audio recording, and with it, you'll notice more clarity while in noisy environments. Camera remote control: Using this, you can take a photo or start and stop video recording with just one press on your AirPods. When taking photos, you'll get a three-second countdown before your iPhone or iPad snaps the picture. Live translation feature: While not officially announced or confirmed, it appears that the long-rumored live translation for AirPods could be coming with iOS 26 . The evidence comes from a system asset spotted in the in iOS 26 beta showing a gesture that's triggered by pressing both earbud stems at the same time. The photo also shows words in several different languages. Which iPhones will be able to upgrade to iOS 26? A few iPhone models that run the current version of iOS — iPhone XR, XS and XS Max — won't be compatible with the latest upgrade. But any iPhones released in 2019 or later will be eligible for the iOS 26 update . iPhone SE (second generation or later) iPhone 11 iPhone 11 Pro iPhone 11 Pro Max iPhone 12 iPhone 12 mini iPhone 12 Pro iPhone 12 Pro Max iPhone 13 iPhone 13 mini iPhone 13 Pro iPhone 13 Pro Max iPhone 14 iPhone 14 Plus iPhone 14 Pro iPhone 14 Pro Max iPhone 15 iPhone 15 Plus iPhone 15 Pro iPhone 15 Pro Max iPhone 16 iPhone 16 Plus iPhone 16 Pro iPhone 16 Pro Max iPhone 16e Not listed here are the presumed new iPhone 17 models (or maybe iPhone 26?) that are all but certain to be announced and released in September. How to install iOS 26 beta The iOS 26 public beta is now available to download via the Apple Beta Software Program . If you're not already a member, you'll need to sign up to try out all the latest features. Just visit beta.apple.com and sign up with your phone number or email address. It's free. Once you're in, you can install it by going to Settings > General > Software Update and selecting iOS 26 public beta . A word of caution: Don't sign up with your main iPhone unless you're OK with any risks that occur with using an OS that isn't finalized. When will the final version of iOS 26 be released? iOS 26 will be released to the public this fall. It usually comes in September, within a week of the Apple iPhone event. Last year, it rolled out to iPhone users on September 16 — exactly one week after the iPhone 16 lineup was announced. If you're more interested in the Apple Intelligence features coming, here's everything Apple revealed for iOS, macOS and more during WWDC.

The new models will come equipped with the latest iOS 26 features preinstalled, along with whatever additional features Apple reveals at the launch event. But since we still have to wait a few weeks (presumably) until the iPhone event, we can at least speculate what the new phones will look like. As with most unreleased iPhone models, rumors and leaks have trickled in about the hardware side ahead of the official introduction. Here's what we're expecting and what we can reasonably assume we'll get from Cupertino in September. How much will the iPhone 17 cost? Apple's announced plan to expand US-based manufacturing partners seems to give it at least some shielding from the steepest Trump administration tariffs that have already triggered price increases on everything from Switch consoles to high-end cameras to Sonos speakers . But given that President Trump's trade policies can change from week to week, and Apple's continuing reliance on Asia-based supply chains, price shocks remain an ongoing possibility. The bigger question is: Will Apple absorb any higher costs, or pass them on to consumers? If prices do creep up, Apple may choose to pair it with an \"upgrade.\" Consider this recent rumor posted by MacRumors from a leaker known as \" Instant Digital ,\" suggesting that the default storage of the iPhone 17 line may start at 256GB, doubling the current 128GB baseline. While that could be accompanied by a price increase of $50 , Apple could at least pitch it as a \"better value.\" That said, the company doubled the default RAM of its Mac computers from 8GB to 16GB at no extra cost in 2024 — but that was before the current Trump tariff cycle started. When will the iPhone 17 series be announced? Most years, the flagship smartphones are introduced in September. MacRumors highlighted a story originally reported by iphone-ticker.de that the Apple iPhone 17 event could be Tuesday, September 9, according to information gleaned from German mobile phone providers. It's still too early to have the specific dates; some years, Apple only gives a week or two of lead time between sending invites and hosting the event. But years of past precedent show that sometime in September should be when the 17 models make their debut. This family of smartphones may be the last to follow that trend, however. There have been hints that the introduction of the iPhone 18 collection in 2026 will be split into a pro-tier announcement in the fall and a standard model announcement the following spring. What will the new iPhone 17 lineup include? Design leaks suggest that Apple is building an ultra-thin smartphone , likely to be named the iPhone 17 Air to match Apple's ultralight laptop designation. Bloomberg 's Mark Gurman, often a solid source of advanced intel about Apple, reported in January that the iPhone 17 Air will be equipped with a basic A19 chip and will only have a single camera lens. It may also use Apple's new in-house modem, which was introduced in February on the iPhone 16e . More details about this development may leak ahead of September, but that's what we know for now. An investor note from Apple analyst Jeff Pu indicated that the Air will have a titanium frame. If his reports are accurate, the lightweight smartphone will be the only entry in the iPhone 17 lineup to use that metal; the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max are expected to be made of aluminum, which is oddly a lighter material than titanium. Other speculation had suggested that the Air would use a blend of aluminum and titanium, so the exact materials may not be known until the official announcement. Additionally, an August 4 MacRumors report says the internal battery pack of the iPhone Air is just 2.49mm thick — half the thickness of the iPhone 17 Pro battery. The leak was posted on the Korean-language Naver blog , where they show the alleged batteries of the iPhone 17 Air and 17 Pro side by side. The same account claimed the 17 Air's battery capacity was a mere 2,800 mAh, MacRumors notes. (That's below the battery capacity of current iPhone 16 models.) A recent rumor from Majin Bu, whom MacRumors classifies as a \"hit-or-miss leaker,\" suggests the iPhone 17 Pro will have better wireless signal strength thanks to an updated antenna design. The individual posted a render on X that shows a new antenna system that wraps around the iPhone 17 Pro's supposedly wider rear camera bump. Again, this is a render, not a real-world photo. That said, we can't knock the goal of better wireless reception, so we're hoping this one has a degree of truth to it. Each new roster includes a base model, but over the years, Apple has shaken up the variety of phones it offers. Most likely there will be an iPhone 17 and an iPhone 17 Pro. Apple has also committed to the size matters philosophy, and has been building an iPhone Pro Max option with an even bigger screen and better battery life; the 17 roster will almost certainly have one as well. The new Pro iPhones are said to have a full-width \"camera island\" on the rear, which would mark the first time an Apple model opted for that design. This feature can be seen in the purported iPhone 17 \"spotted in the wild.\" The pics, highlighted on MacRumors , show a black cased iPhone (17 Pro?) with the distinct back panel. Is it the real deal? The dual angles lend a degree of credibility in a social media landscape increasingly polluted with AI-enhanced fakes, but your guess is as good as ours. I just spotted a test development iPhone in the wild 🤩🤩🤩 pic.twitter.com/iS3PtKWqxJ — Fox Pupy 🦊🧡 (@Skyfops) July 28, 2025 The iPhone 17 Air seems primed to take the place of a potential iPhone 17 Plus. Since the iPhone 16e was only just introduced in February at a surprisingly high price point , it seems unlikely that there will be a new addition to that lower end of the spectrum, the models that were previously called SE. At the very least, it sounds like the iPhone 17 Air won't take away the charging port and rely only on wireless connectivity. Bloomberg said that while Apple had investigated making the iPhone 17 Air without a single port, the company (fortunately) changed plans. He also says that the rumored phone will have a 6.6-inch screen and include the Dynamic Island and Camera Control button. Finally, the price is rumored at $900 — likely more than the standard iPhone 17 but less than the Pro. We've also gotten what seems to be a reliable look at what the color lineup will be for the new smartphones. Macworld reported that the iPhone 17 will be available in black, white, steel gray, green, purple and light blue. The iPhone 17 Air will reportedly have four color options: black, white, light blue and light gold. While the Air colors will be less saturated, the visuals for the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max will go bold. The options for the Pro models are expected to be black, white, gray, dark blue and orange. On July 30, Tom's Guide highlighted an X post from Sonny Dickson — a longtime and generally reliable leaker of unreleased iPhone information — showing \"dummy\" iPhone 17 models in the new colors that were the source of the aforementioned Macworld story. While these are literally just mock-ups — not real, leaked iPhones — it's interesting to see how the design and color rumors translate into a real-world look and feel. What will iOS 26 be like? Apple upended its numbering conventions with WWDC 2025, and will match the name of each new operating system to the year it's released. So when the next wave of iPhones hits, they'll be running on iOS 26 . On the design side, the smartphone OS introduced during the big developer showcase took a contentious approach dubbed Liquid Glass. Apple has been scaling down the amount of transparency effects in the subsequent beta tests of iOS 26, but it will still have a glass-like visual. The feature list includes big and small updates. On the more impactful side, the Phone and Photos apps have been redesigned. There will be several features leveraging artificial intelligence, such as live translation capabilities coming to Phone, FaceTime and Messages. Apple is also currently testing a sensitive content warning for child accounts that will freeze FaceTime video if nudity is detected by on-device machine learning tools. And the company is also launching Visual Intelligence, which will use AI to search for elements in an image. iOS 26 also has a litany of minor, quality of life improvements. Group texts are getting support for polls. And for the slow risers out there, iOS 26 will finally let you escape the tyranny of the nine minute snooze alarm . The next iOS is now available as a public beta . Here are our initial impressions of the Liquid Glass design and other new features. iOS 26 is compatible with all models back through iPhone 11. What other products are expected to be released alongside the iPhone 17? If Apple follows its usual pattern, the iPhone 17 will be announced alongside new Apple Watch products. That would be the Apple Watch Series 11 (if Apple sticks to the same naming scheme), and maybe an Apple Watch Ultra 3 and/or an updated Apple Watch SE. (They'll all run watchOS 26 , of course.) Other possibilities — and this is, again, speculation — could include refreshed Apple AirPods Pro (which received its last big update in 2022 ) and maybe new AirTags trackers (first released in 2021). But knowing Apple doesn't like to take the spotlight off its star performer — the iPhone — those accessories could come sometime later in the year (if they appear this year at all). The same goes for rumored refreshes of the Apple TV and HomePod mini , which are also getting long in the tooth. Don't expect any Macs or iPads, however. Apple has recently been holding computer updates for late October (as it did last year with the new M4 Macs ). Update, August, 13, 2025, 10:02PM ET: Added a list of the products that are expected to be released alongside the iPhone 17s. Update, August 11, 2025, 7:27PM ET: Added a render of a rumored new antenna design for the iPhone 17 Pro. Update, August 8, 2025, 4:43PM ET: Added new speculation and reports about iPhone 17 pricing.

A pretty cool option available on both is the visual update, called Liquid Glass — it's like the better-executed version of Windows Vista . We spent two weeks test-driving it — you can check out our detailed hands-on iOS 26 preview , or you can try it out yourself by downloading and installing the public beta 2 . That software is a more stable iteration of the separate developer version, which recently hit the beta 6 waypoint, and offers a few more flashy features not yet available in the public version. (While the public beta is open to everyone and quite stable, always remember there's a degree of risk involved with beta software.) Additionally, there are credible reports that iOS 26 could bring a new live translation feature to AirPods , too. Not ready to upgrade your smartphone or tablet this year? No worries, we'll help you find out if your devices will be able to run iOS 26. While Apple didn't nix any iPhones from its eligibility list last year, that's not the case for 2025 — a few models are getting cut this time. All iPhone 8 models and the iPhone X were the last to get the boot in 2023, and this year the 2018 models are getting left behind. If you have an ineligible device, you won't be able to download iOS 26 when it becomes available this fall. We'll get to the bottom of which iPhones and iPads will support iOS 26 and iPadOS 26 this year. To see what's coming with the latest OSes, check out everything announced at Apple's WWDC June 9 event . One thing you shouldn't immediately expect is Apple's updated version of Siri , though the company is reportedly working on a 'stripped-down' AI chatbot to compete with ChatGPT. These three iPhones won't be compatible with iOS 26 Unlike last year, several iPhone models won't be eligible to download the newest iOS when it makes its debut this fall. This trio of models first released in 2018 won't be coming to the iOS 26 party: iPhone XR iPhone XS iPhone XS Max iPhones compatible with iOS 26 While we don't yet know the new iPhones Apple will be dropping this fall — though there are iPhone 17 rumors — we do know, per Apple's site , that the phones listed below will be compatible with iOS 26. Basically, if you have an iPhone that was announced in 2019 or later, you're in the clear: iPhone SE (second generation or later) iPhone 11 iPhone 11 Pro iPhone 11 Pro Max iPhone 12 iPhone 12 mini iPhone 12 Pro iPhone 12 Pro Max iPhone 13 iPhone 13 mini iPhone 13 Pro iPhone 13 Pro Max iPhone 14 iPhone 14 Plus iPhone 14 Pro iPhone 14 Pro Max iPhone 15 iPhone 15 Plus iPhone 15 Pro iPhone 15 Pro Max iPhone 16 iPhone 16 Plus iPhone 16 Pro iPhone 16 Pro Max iPhone 16e iPads compatible with iPadOS 26 The iPads listed below, and any iPads released later this year, are eligible to download iPadOS 26 . iPad Pro (M4) iPad Pro 12.9‑inch (3rd generation and later) iPad Pro 11‑inch (1st generation and later) iPad Air (3rd generation and later, including M2 and M3) iPad (8th generation and later, including A16) iPad mini (5th generation and later, including A17 Pro) What if I don't want to buy a new iPhone? If you want to continue using your older iPhone that isn't supported by iOS 26, that's fine. However, you'll miss out on security updates which could potentially put your phone at risk for malware and other threats. Additionally, some apps may stop working if they require a certain version of iOS or later. And of course, you won't be able to access the latest features iOS 26 offers. When will iOS 26 become available? Apple usually rolls out its latest iOS in mid-September, just a few days before the new iPhones hit store shelves. Last year, it released iOS 18 on Monday, Sept. 16. Expect a confirmation of the release date at the iPhone 17 event, expected in early September. iOS 26 features we're excited about Liquid Glass design : Your home screen is getting revamped with new app icons, including dark mode and all-clear options. You'll also notice buttons with a new floating design. Liquid Glass was designed to make all of Apple's OSes more cohesive. Phone app redesign: You'll finally be able to scroll through contacts, recent calls and voicemail messages all on one screen. It also comes with a new feature called Hold Assist that'll notify you when an agent comes to the phone so you can avoid the elevator music. Live Translate: iOS 26 is bringing the ability to have a conversation via phone call or text message with someone who speaks another language. Live Translate will translate your conversation in real time. Polls feature: Coming to group messages in the Messages app, chat members will be able to create polls. This can help prevent the unwanted 30+ messages when it comes to deciding which restaurant you're meeting at this weekend.

The latest missive from Mark Gurman at Bloomberg suggests that Apple is shifting its artificial intelligence goals to center on new device segments. Sources reportedly told the publication that Apple has a slate of new smart home products in the works that could help pivot its lagging AI strategy. The center of the new lineup is a tabletop AI companion that has been described as an iPad on a movable robotic arm. It would be able to swivel to face the screen toward a user as they move around their home or office. Sources said the current prototype uses a horizontal display that's about seven inches while the motorized arm can move the screen about six inches away from the base in any direction. Equipped with a long-promised overhaul to the Siri voice assistant, this device could act like an additional person, recalling information, making suggestions and participating in conversations. According to Bloomberg , Apple is targeting a 2027 release for this product. Apple's new lineup is also rumored to include a smart home hub that is a simpler version of the robotic friend with no moving stand. We might be seeing this sooner, with a projected 2026 release for the device. This hub device would be able to control music playback, take notes, browse the web and host videoconferencing. Both the robot companion and the smart home hub are reportedly running a new operating system called Charismatic that's designed to support multiple users. The Siri running on the device will be given a particularly cheery personality, and it may also be getting a visual representation. Bloomberg 's sources said there hasn't been a final decision on aesthetics; internal tests have had Siri looking like an animated Finder icon and like a Memoji. Today's scuttlebutt follows on previous reports from Gurman that pointed to Apple's interest in these categories. The idea of a smart home hub was apparently floated at the company as far back as 2022, and it's finally being rumored to have a formal debut some time this year. Robots have also been a topic of interest in Cupertino for some time, with claims that Apple was developing a personal robot dating back at least to last spring . While this Bloomberg piece offers more detail about those hypothetical plans, there's always a chance Apple will change direction or scrap a project.

A crucial aspect of this is unlocking the sector's potential to channel capital into managing the risks and opportunities of the transition to net zero.We will continue to monitor the SLL market as part of our wider work on transition finance, and welcome further constructive dialogue with banks.We will also work closely with the Transition Finance Council (TFC) to promote the competitive position of the UK as a transition finance hub, in line with the Government's ambitions.We encourage banks to engage collaboratively with the TFC's work, to build alignment in approaches to transition finance.", "ingested_utc": "2025-08-14T16:32:28Z", "retrieved_utc": "2025-08-14T16:32:28Z"}

But for some, credit isn’t about luxuries – it’s about getting by.5% (2.8 million) had persistent credit card debt, meaning they paid more in interest and charges than they paid off.21% (11.4 million) had been overdrawn at some point in the past year.Of those with personal loans, 10% - equivalent to around 1.6 million UK adults - used them to cover everyday expenses like food, travel, or rent.These figures show how deeply embedded credit is in daily life – and the complexities involved when it becomes a lifeline rather than a tool.What we’ve learnedOver the years, we’ve listened to consumers, firms, and community organisations. Three key lessons stand out:Credit isn’t always the answer. For some, the right support might be getting help with managing your money, checking benefits or finding work - not another loan. Signposting consumers to help is an appropriate outcome - which also aligns with the Consumer Duty.Technology has transformed the sector – especially when it comes to spotting harm. Digital tools may have made credit more accessible, but it can also be used to spot early signs of financial difficulty. We recently echoed this in our call for improvements to digital loan processes, highlighting the need for fairer, more transparent online journeys.The best results happen when we work together - and that means traditional banks, fintechs, community lenders and mutuals, and the rest of the commercial sector. Take our 2024 Financial Inclusion Tech Sprint, where one of the winning collaborations between community lender Moneyline and fintech Inbest.ai developed a signposting toolkit for customers declined for credit. The tool offers tailored referrals to debt advice, income maximisation resources, and social tariffs – and in some cases, provides small crisis grants to those most in need. It’s a powerful example of how innovation and partnership can deliver meaningful support beyond credit.How did we get here?We took over responsibility for consumer credit in 2014. Since then, we’ve concentrated on raising standards. We introduced the high-cost-short-term-credit price cap, which has benefitted 760,000 customers, saving them £150m annually. We strengthened support for borrowers in difficulty and acted against firms not getting it right. Both the Senior Managers & Certification Regime and the Consumer Duty have also built a strong foundation for a fairer, more resilient and more innovative consumer credit sector all round.Some firms have thrived adapting to these reforms. Others ended up leaving the market -particularly high-cost credit firms. While this has reduced harmful practices, it’s also made access to credit more difficult for some, highlighting the complexity of consumer needs.What’s the plan for consumer credit over the next decade?If the last decade was about raising standards, the next must be about forging a better outlook.This is tied to our mission in our 5-year strategy of supporting growth and helping consumers navigate their financial lives. Because a healthy, innovative consumer credit sector can protect consumers and help them – and firms – to thrive.Three priorities will guide our work:Innovation that adds real value. The best financial products are intuitive, transparent and genuinely useful. Simplicity unlocks confidence and economic activity.Vulnerable customers getting compassionate support. This is non-negotiable. Any one of us can face hardship. The difference between recovery and crisis often lies in how firms respond.People need credit that’s both accessible and right for them. Getting that balance right between access and protection is essential – not just for individuals, but the whole economy. We’re playing an active role in the Government’s Financial Inclusion Committee, helping to shape policies that promote fair access to affordable credit and financial services – particularly for those most at risk of being turned down and left out.There’s no single solution. But by working together – regulators, firms and communities – we can nurture a system that supports consumers at each stage of their financial lives.We invite all firms to be part of this conversation and the solutions it inspires. Together, we can shape a fairer, more resilient financial future.", "ingested_utc": "2025-08-14T16:32:28Z", "retrieved_utc": "2025-08-14T16:32:28Z"}

Further details are provided on the relevant webpages of the calculations. Bonds quarterly liquidity assessment ESMA has published the latest quarterly liquidity assessment for bonds available for trading on EU trading venues. For this period, there are currently 1,346 liquid bonds subject to MiFID II transparency requirements. ESMA’s liquidity assessment for bonds is based on a quarterly assessment of quantitative liquidity criteria, which includes the daily average trading activity (trades and notional amount) and the percentage of days traded per quarter. ESMA updates the bond market liquidity assessments quarterly. However, additional data and corrections submitted to ESMA may result in further updates within each quarter, published in ESMA’s Financial Instruments Transparency System (FITRS) , which shall be applicable the day following publication . The full list of assessed bonds is now available through FITRS in the XML files with publication date from 1 August 2025 ( see here ) and through the Register web interface ( see here ). ESMA also publishes two completeness indicators related to bond liquidity data. The transparency requirements for bonds deemed liquid today will apply from 18 August to 16 November 202 5.

The new VCM limits at 7% the trading volume under the reference price waiver in the EU, compared to the total aggregated trading volume in the EU over the last 12 months for each equity and equity-like financial instrument. If the limit is exceeded, trading venues will need to suspend the use of the waiver for the concerned instrument for a period of three months. Trading venues must base their decision to suspend the waiver use on the data published by ESMA under the dedicated VCM webpage. Technical reporting changes To reduce reporting burden of entities, the future VCM calculations will be based on transaction reporting data collected by National Competent Authorities (NCAs). Therefore, the DVCM reporting system will be decommissioned in January 2026. To reflect these changes, ESMA has submitted for adoption the amendment to the Regulatory Technical Standard 3 (RTS 3). Even in case the RTS 3 revision is not yet in place at that moment, the VCM switch will occur at the announced date. ESMA is currently preparing the new VCM data system. For more details about the formats and templates, please consult the dedicated VCM webpage. Next steps ESMA encourages all interested parties to prepare for the change in requirements in line with the new VCM becoming active in Q4 2025. The first publication of the calculation results is expected for 9 October 2025.

The latest Peer Review analysed the approaches adopted by the Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA). While there is overall a good level of supervisory engagement within the authority, we underlined certain areas for improvement. Moreover, the thematic notes outline four guiding principles on making sustainability claims used in non-regulatory communications. It also offers practical do’s and don’ts, illustrated through concrete examples of good and poor practices, based on observed market practices. In the course of 2023 and 2024, ESMA, together with the National Competent Authorities (NCAs), carried out the Common Supervisory Action (CSA) on the integration of sustainability risks and disclosures in the investment management sector. The level of compliance with the framework on the integration of sustainability risks and disclosures is overall satisfactory, but there remain opportunities for improvement.

The list also includes trading venues that can choose to transmit data to the equity CTP and opt-in to the mandatory data contribution regime. As specified in the Market in Financial Instruments Regulation (MiFIR) the trading venues opting-in will need to contribute data to the CTP within 30 days from the notification to ESMA. ESMA will immediately update the list once a trading venue starts or ends operations and when a trading venue decides to voluntary opt-in. Next steps The entities that decide to opt-in will communicate their decision to ESMA, at the following email address: secondary-markets@esma.europa.eu . Additionally, they will notify to their National Competent Authority (NCA). The next publication of the list will be in January 2026. Background According to MiFIR, ESMA must publish on its website and keep up to date a list identifying: investment firms operating small and medium enterprises (SME) growth markets and market operators that are mandated to contribute data to the CTP, investment firms that are not obliged to contribute but can opt-in to the mandatory regime, and investment firms that decided to opt-in. Not all trading venues will be required to contribute data to the equity CTP, once it will be established. Specifically, smaller trading venues that either do not belong to a large group or have a high concentration of instruments first listed on their platforms are not obligated to submit data to the CTP, unless they choose to participate in the regime.

The peer review analyses the approaches adopted by the Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA) in the authorisation and early supervision of a CASP and provides recommendations to strengthen these processes. It identifies overall a good level of resources and supervisory engagement within the authority, with some areas for improvement related to the assessment of authorisations. Key findings: Some material issues where not fully resolved when MFSA granted the CASP authorisation; Some risks areas were not adequately assessed during the authorisation process; The MFSA has demonstrated a good level of expertise and supervisory cooperation. The peer review also recommends to all NCAs currently in the process of authorising CASPs to pay particular attention to certain areas of risk, including business growth, conflicts of interests, governance and intragroup arrangements, ICT architecture, Web3, decentralised products, and the promotion of unregulated services. While focused on an individual case, the review aims to foster the sound authorisation of CASPs by all NCAs in the EU. Its conclusions should be on-boarded by all NCAs to ensure that the authorisations they grant are well assessed in this new and high-risk sector, where supervisory knowledge is still being built. This exercise is also an opportunity to reinforce EU supervisors’ role as gatekeepers of the EU single market in the crypto space. Next steps The objective of peer reviews is to enhance convergence and harmonisation in the process across the EU, and the NCAs are expected to integrate the recommendations in their internal processes, as well as in their on-going and future authorisations. ESMA will continue promoting further discussion on the recommendations and cross border cooperation.

Under this plan, and in line with the Paris Agreement, ESMA commits to reducing its gross greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 15.4% in 2027 and 31.4% in 2030, compared to 2023. Through the implementation of the Climate Transition Plan, ESMA aims to reduce the carbon footprint of its operations, particularly in relation to staff business travel, energy use, and food consumption. In the short term, progress towards this goal will be achieved through: introduction of an annual GHG budget to manage emissions from air travel, optimising floor occupancy during certain periods of the year to reduce energy consumption, and implementing incentives to shift to lower-carbon practices in the purchase of goods and services. This first plan has been put in place with the data currently available. It will be regularly reviewed, adapted, and improved. Next steps ESMA will implement decarbonisation levers and measures identified under this Climate Transition Plan and will report on the progress achieved annually, via its Annual Report and its Environmental Statement.

The activities of these firms are vital for the financial health and growth of the UK economy.Therefore, making sure these firms are resilient and financially stable ensures they provide consumers and businesses with the services they need – in both good times and bad.Non-banks use leverage (borrowing to invest) to increase exposure, boost returns or hedge potential losses. This can be achieved in various ways, ranging from taking out loans to using complex derivatives. The use of leverage is an essential component of the deep and efficient capital markets that we have in the UK.In good times, this leverage provides extra liquidity to the system and helps maximise returns. But in periods of market stress, leverage that is poorly managed, concentrated, or hard to spot can raise instability. This is particularly true in markets that are core to the functioning of the real economy. For example, UK government debt markets, or when highly leveraged non-banks risk transferring stress to institutions like banks, which are central to the stability of the financial system.As the regulator, our role is to ensure that markets work well. Leverage is not inherently a cause for concern. But to ensure that leverage can continue to play its part in supporting the UK economy in good times and bad, we need to find ways to identify and address systemic risks - without impeding market efficiency or disproportionately burdening firms.FSB recommendationsTwo years ago, I took up a role as co-chair of the Financial Stability Board's (FSB’s) working group on non-bank leverage. This group recently published policy recommendations (PDF) seeking to identify and address financial stability risks created by non-bank leverage.Effective risk management depends on having the right information at the right time. Without it, both market participants and regulators are essentially flying blind. The report addresses this fundamental challenge by recommending stronger risk monitoring and greater market transparency.The proposed measures put forward by the FSB focus on improving how firms share critical information – both publicly and with their trading partners. These measures should give firms better insight into their own exposures and broader market conditions, helping them manage investment risks more effectively. The improvements should also provide authorities with a comprehensive view of the entire system. Having this birds-eye view enables authorities to spot risks that individual firms might not see – such as dangerous concentrations of investments or overcrowded market positions.The FSB report also provides policy options for authorities to consider once they address risks to financial stability. Given the complex and diverse nature of the non-bank sector, there's no one-size-fits-all approach – so the report sets out a number of different alternatives that authorities may wish to consider. This approach is a good one - what matters is that all jurisdictions have sufficient measures to manage systemic risk, even if different authorities choose a different set of policy tools or measures to do so.What's next for the UK?We are already working to become a smarter regulator, and we're focusing on how we collect and use data to spot risks early.To do our job, which is to make sure that markets function well, we know we need data that provides the practical insights we need to make effective, proportionate decisions.The FSB recommendations are well timed for us. We are already taking steps to evaluate what data we need and switching off regulatory reporting returns that are no longer relevant. There is an ongoing programme of work looking at our data needs – and we’ll think carefully about which risk metrics are most useful for us going forward, including how we can align with other jurisdictions.Working with our international partnersAs much of the non-bank sector operates across borders, it’s crucial that we also collaborate with our international counterparts to spot risks and potential spillovers effectively.This means engaging bilaterally on issues like information sharing and risk monitoring, while continuing to take an active role in international standard-setting bodies. In this way, we can strive for internationally consistent outcomes and be confident that we’re safeguarding the system, while still ensuring that the UK remains competitive.My time leading this FSB working group has highlighted that non-bank leverage is a particularly tricky issue to tackle, demanding in-depth knowledge, industry perspective, and extensive international cooperation. The publication of the FSB’s recommendations is a major step forward in this space – and I’m proud that the FCA has been able to play such a leading role in advancing this work.", "ingested_utc": "2025-08-14T06:45:04Z", "retrieved_utc": "2025-08-14T06:45:04Z"}

Separately, there will be a competitive layer of open banking schemes, which operate commercially. We expect these schemes to utilise the common API standards developed and overseen by the Future Entity, but they may innovate above these standards to provide premium services. APIs allow different firms’ software applications to communicate and interact with each other, exchanging data quickly and securely.

The FCA has decided to fine Mr Woodford £5,888,800 and ban him from holding senior manager roles and managing funds for retail investors.The FCA has also decided to fine WIM £40,000,000.WEIF was an investment fund managed by Mr Woodford and WIM. They were responsible for managing the liquidity of the fund, so that investors could redeem their investments and be repaid.The fund was suspended in June 2019, leaving investors – a significant majority of whom were ordinary retail customers – unable to access their money. The value of the WEIF had fallen from a high of over £10.1bn in May 2017 to just £3.6bn in the run-up to its suspension.The FCA has concluded that between July 2018 and June 2019 WIM and Mr Woodford made unreasonable and inappropriate investment decisions. They disproportionately sold more liquid investments (those that are easier to sell) and bought less liquid ones over this period. This meant that at the time of suspension only 8% of the investments held by WEIF could be sold within 7 days. Under rules in place at the time, investors should have been able to access their funds within 4 days.WIM and Mr Woodford did not react appropriately as the fund’s value declined, its liquidity worsened and more investors withdrew their money. This disadvantaged investors who remained in the fund, compared to those who had withdrawn their investment before the fund was suspended.The FCA has concluded that Mr Woodford held a defective and unreasonably narrow understanding of his responsibilities. Despite his senior role, he did not accept that he had a responsibility to oversee the management of the fund’s liquidity, including in interviews conducted by the FCA. He also failed to provide proper oversight of WIM’s relationship with Link Fund Solutions (Link), the WEIF’s authorised corporate director, including after Link raised concerns about the fund’s liquidity.The FCA considers Mr Woodford’s and WIM’s failings led to a significantly increased risk of the fund being suspended.Steve Smart, joint executive director of enforcement and market oversight at the FCA, said:'Being a leader in financial services comes with responsibilities as well as profile. Mr Woodford simply doesn’t accept he had any role in managing the liquidity of the fund. The very minimum investors should expect is those managing their money make sensible decisions and take their senior role seriously. Neither Neil Woodford nor Woodford Investment Management did so, putting at risk the money people had entrusted them with.’The FCA previously set out its findings against Link for its role in the suspension of the WEIF. This included securing a £230m redress scheme for those investors stuck in the fund when it was suspended.Notes to editorsDecision Notice 2025: Neil Woodford (PDF)Decision Notice 2025: Woodford Investment Management Limited (PDF)", "ingested_utc": "2025-08-14T06:45:04Z", "retrieved_utc": "2025-08-14T06:45:04Z"}

Many motor finance firms were not complying with rules or the law by not providing customers with relevant information about commission paid by lenders to the car dealers who sold the loans.The FCA has moved quickly on steps to set up a proposed compensation scheme because it wants to provide clarity and certainty to consumers, firms and investors as quickly as possible.It also wants to ensure the integrity of the motor finance market so it works well for consumers now and in the future. The compensation scheme would balance principles including fairness, timeliness, and certainty.Nikhil Rathi, chief executive of the FCA, said:'It is clear that some firms have broken the law and our rules. It’s fair for their customers to be compensated. We also want to ensure that the market, relied on by millions each year, can continue to work well and consumers can get a fair deal.'Our aim is a compensation scheme that’s fair and easy to participate in, so there’s no need to use a claims management company or law firm. If you do, it will cost you a significant chunk of any money you get.'It will take time to establish a scheme but we hope to start getting people any money they are owed next year.'The announcement follows Friday’s landmark ruling by the Supreme Court, on cases in which the FCA had intervened. While some motor finance customers won’t get compensation because in many cases commission payments were legal, the Court ruled that in certain circumstances the failure to properly disclose commission arrangements could be unfair and therefore unlawful.The FCA will propose rules on how lenders should consistently, efficiently and fairly decide whether someone is owed compensation and how much. It will monitor if firms are following the rules and act if they’re not.The FCA currently estimates that most individuals will probably receive less than £950 in compensation per agreement.The final total cost of any compensation scheme will depend on the final design. That makes it hard to estimate precisely. Any estimates are only indicative at this stage and may change. The FCA thinks it unlikely the cost of the scheme, including to run it, would be much lower than £9 billion. And it could be higher, up to £18 billion in some scenarios though the FCA doesn’t believe these are the most likely. A total cost midway in the range, as forecast by some analysts, is more plausible.The consultation will launch by early October. If the compensation scheme goes ahead, the first payments should be made in 2026.People who have already complained don’t need to do anything. Consumers who are concerned that they were not told about commission and think they may have paid too much for their motor finance should complain now. Consumers do not need to use a claims management company or law firm and doing so could cost them around 30% of any compensation paid.The FCA recognises that consumers want to receive any compensation owed quickly and firms and investors want certainty. The regulator will be working intensively and engaging widely over the coming weeks on the detail of how a scheme would work.Notes to editors The full market statement: FCA to consult on a compensation scheme for motor finance customersThe Supreme Court judgment", "ingested_utc": "2025-08-14T06:45:04Z", "retrieved_utc": "2025-08-14T06:45:04Z"}

Any redress scheme must be fair to consumers who have lost out and ensure the integrity of the motor finance market, so it works well for future consumers.We will publish the consultation by early October and finalise any scheme in time for people to start receiving compensation next year.Why are we proposing a redress scheme?Our detailed review of the past use of motor finance has shown that many firms were not complying with the law or our disclosure rules that were in force when they sold loans to consumers. Where consumers have lost out, they should be appropriately compensated in an orderly, consistent and efficient way.Some consumers have challenged their agreements with lenders through the courts. On Friday the Supreme Court ruled that in many cases commission payments could be legal, but a lender did act unfairly – and therefore unlawfully - due in part to the size of the commission it paid to the motor dealer and how it was disclosed.The Supreme Court agreed with several factors we had identified which could point towards an unfair relationship and fall foul of the Consumer Credit Act (CCA), whilst recognising it depends on the facts of each case.Such factors could include:the size of the commission relative to the charge for creditthe nature of the commission, for example, whether it is discretionarythe characteristics of the consumercompliance with regulatory rulesthe extent and manner of disclosureThis clarity helps us because we have been looking at what is unfair and, prior to this judgment, there were different interpretations of the law coming from different courts.We will now consult on a redress scheme. Redress would depend on non-disclosure of the factors above and the interaction between them.The principles underpinning a redress schemeWe set out in June the principles that would guide a redress scheme. These are:comprehensivenessfairnesscertaintysimplicity and cost effectivenesstimelinesstransparencymarket integrityThere may be tensions between these principles, which will require us to strike the right balance. We will explore these during the consultation.Scope and design of redress schemeWe have been carefully analysing the Supreme Court’s judgment and how it may affect the scope and structure of a redress scheme. While that work is ongoing, we want to provide as much clarity and certainty to consumers and firms as quickly as possible.Our consultation will cover how firms should assess whether the relationship between the lender and borrower was unfair for the purposes of our scheme and if so, what compensation should be paid.In the Supreme Court case and our review of past practices, the unfairness to consumers has arisen from the non-disclosure of particular features of the commission arrangements. But many of these features are not themselves unfair. And the Supreme Court said that non-disclosure or partial disclosure of the commission will not necessarily make the relationship unfair.Our consultation will, therefore, need to consider how a range of factors must be assessed together when deciding on whether the relationship was unfair. As we prepare the consultation, we will consider if and how factors such as the non-disclosure of the nature and size of the commission, tied commercial relationships and customer sophistication should be factored in.Discretionary commission arrangements and non- discretionary commission arrangementsWe will propose that the scheme covers discretionary commission arrangements (DCAs) – where the broker could adjust the interest rate offered to a customer – if they were not properly disclosed.We will also consult on which non-discretionary commission arrangements should be included. This is because the Supreme Court decision in the Johnson case, which did not include the payment of any discretionary commission, makes clear that non-disclosure of other facts relating to the commission can make the relationship unfair.Redress calculationOur methodology for calculating redress will be informed by the degree of harm suffered by the consumer and the need to ensure consumers continue to be able to access affordable loans for motor vehicles.The Supreme Court decided that the appropriate remedy in the Johnson case was the payment of the commission. We will consider this option alongside alternative approaches. It is unlikely any alternative would lead to higher remedies overall than full repayment of commission. Some could lead to lower payments.We will consult on whether there should be a de minimis threshold to be eligible for a compensation payment.InterestInterest is normally paid on redress awards. This should be fair and proportionate. In the case it upheld, the Supreme Court required a commercial rate of interest to be paid.We plan to consult on an interest rate for each year of the scheme based on the average base rate that year plus 1%. This would be in the ballpark of a simple interest rate of 3% per annum.TimeframeWe think the scheme should cover agreements dating back to 2007, to be consistent with the complaints the Financial Ombudsman can consider and to ensure the scheme is comprehensive. This would mean consumers would not need to use other routes to secure compensation and prevent large numbers of ongoing disputes in the courts. We are discussing with the Government the best way of doing this.Opt in / opt outWe have not yet decided whether to propose an opt-in or opt-out scheme. There are pros and cons to either approach and a range of views, which will be explored thoroughly through the consultation.Whichever approach we propose, we anticipate requiring firms as far as possible to make customers aware they may be eligible and what they may need to do.High commissionThe Supreme Court found that a high and undisclosed commission – in this case 55% of the total cost of the credit – was ‘a powerful indication’ of an unfair relationship. The court also found that this was a breach of our rules, as disclosure of so high a commission would have had a ‘material impact’ on the customer’s decision.We will, therefore, need to consider what size of commission in the context of the overall finance arrangements may point towards unfairness if not disclosed.Total cost of redressThe final cost of any redress scheme will depend on the final design and the factors, including those set out above.This makes it hard to estimate precisely at this stage the total cost to industry of the scheme. Any estimates are highly indicative and susceptible to change.The final cost will also depend on the take-up rate, the methodology to calculate redress and the mix of discretionary and non-discretionary arrangements ultimately included.At this stage, we think it is unlikely that the cost of any scheme, including administrative costs would be materially lower than £9bn and it could be materially higher. While there are plausible scenarios which underpin estimates of a total cost as high as £18bn, we do not consider those scenarios to be the most likely and analyst estimates in the mid point of this range are more plausible.The FCA currently estimates that most individuals will probably receive less than £950 in compensation per agreement.Market impactWe have been analysing the potential impact of a redress scheme on firms and the motor finance market. We expect a healthy finance market for new and used cars to continue notwithstanding any redress scheme we propose. We will set out more detailed analysis in our consultation and continue to monitor market functioning.Advice to firmsFirms must comply with the law and our rules. We also welcomed the industry-led practices to enhance the information provided to customers following the Court of Appeal judgment of 25 October 2024 on motor commission arrangements. Under the Consumer Duty, we increasingly monitor outcomes consumers are receiving as well as compliance with rules. Our view is that these updated practices are contributing to better consumer outcomes.Prudential rules require regulated firms to maintain adequate financial resources. Firms with listed securities must also keep the market properly informed. Each firm must make their own assessment of potential liabilities, as many have done.Firms should now refresh their estimates, ensuring they cover both liability for compensation and the administrative costs. There will remain a degree of uncertainty about these estimates until a redress scheme is finalised, but it is important that firms act and make sufficient provisions, increasing them where necessary.Complaints deadlineFirms currently do not have to provide a final response to relevant motor finance complaints before 4 December 2025. We will consult on further extending this deadline to align with the timetable for compensation payments of the proposed redress scheme.This will prevent disorderly, inconsistent and inefficient outcomes for consumers and knock-on effects on firms and the market.Advice to consumersPeople who have already complained don’t need to do anything. Our advice remains that consumers concerned that they were not told about commission and who think they may have paid too much for the finance, should complain now.We aim to make any scheme easy to participate in, without needing to use a claims management company (CMC) or law firm. Using a CMC or law firm may end up costing them up to 30% in fees of any compensation they receive.Over the last year, the FCA has required 225 promotions from CMCs on motor finance to be amended or withdrawn, including some which were highly speculative in suggesting the compensation consumers may get.We will continue to act against firms using clickbait-style promotions or language that suggests a guaranteed outcome before any investigation into a consumer’s claim has taken place. Firms must ensure that all financial promotions are clear, fair, and not misleading, and that they accurately reflect the nature and status of any potential claims.We will ensure firms handle claims consistently, efficiently and fairly.Next stepsWe recognise that consumers want to receive any compensation owed quickly and firms and investors want certainty.We will be working intensively and engaging widely over the coming weeks on the detail of how a scheme would work.We aim to publish the consultation by early October and for it to be open for 6 weeks. No final decisions have yet been taken in relation to the scheme. We aim to finalise the rules such that the scheme can launch in 2026, with consumers starting to receive compensation next year.", "ingested_utc": "2025-08-14T06:45:04Z", "retrieved_utc": "2025-08-14T06:45:04Z"}

Crypto ETNs that retail consumers can access must be traded on an FCA-approved, UK-based investment exchange (a Recognised Investment Exchange or RIE). Financial promotion rules will apply so consumers get the right information and aren’t offered inappropriate incentives to invest. David Geale, executive director of payments and digital finance at the FCA, said:'Since we restricted retail access to cETNs, the market has evolved, and products have become more mainstream and better understood. In light of this, we’re providing consumers with more choice, while ensuring there are protections in place. This should mean people get the information they need to assess whether the level of risk is right for them.'The Consumer Duty will apply to firms offering these products to retail investors. However, there won’t be coverage from the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS). Consumers should ensure they understand the risks before deciding to invest.This is the latest development as the FCA continues to establish a regulatory framework for crypto. We have outlined our crypto roadmap and recently published proposals on stablecoins as well as other aspects of the regime.The FCA’s ban on retail access to cryptoasset derivatives will remain in place. The FCA will continue to monitor market developments and consider its approach to high-risk investments.Notes to editorsIn January 2021, the FCA banned the sale, marketing and distribution of derivatives and ETNs that reference unregulated transferable cryptoassets to retail clients.In March 2024, the FCA announced we would not object to requests from recognised investment exchanges (such as Cboe or the London Stock Exchange) to create a UK listed market segment for cryptoasset-backed exchange traded notes (cETNs) for professional investors. In June 2025, the FCA launched a consultation on proposals to lift the ban on retail access to cETNs.The FCA grants recognition orders to investment exchanges in the UK to make sure they meet regulatory standards. This power is provided under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 for the FCA to consider applications from UK entities (a body corporate or an unincorporated association) for recognition as a UK recognised body. Examples of recognition requirements include equivalent protection for investors.

It has the potential to transform decision-making and customer experiences in UK financial services for the better. But it also raises concerns about how it can be used safely and responsibly. This can slow the pace of innovation if left unanswered as well as introduce new risks.That's why we’re proposing AI Live Testing – a practical, collaborative way for firms and the FCA to explore methods to assure AI systems together. Here, we set out why you should apply to take part. The promise of AI Using AI can result in: Smarter decision-making: Models can process huge volumes of data to assess risk, automate compliance, and tailor financial products.Stronger protections: Machine learning systems are spotting anomalies and stopping fraud before it affects consumers. Better experiences: Natural language models and predictive analytics can personalise financial products to better meet consumer needs. But this innovation depends on more than just computing power and data. Crucially, it also depends on confidence that AI can be used safely and responsibly in UK financial markets. Otherwise, innovation will stall. We want the UK to be a place where beneficial technological innovation can thrive to support growth and competitiveness. The question then becomes: how can we build confidence in AI so that consumers and markets benefit? The regulatory challenge: clarity without closureYet, this is where financial services regulators face a tricky balance. On the one hand, at the FCA we recognise that firms need regulatory clarity on AI – a predictable framework to guide their investments, operations, and risk management.On the other hand, we also recognise that if we, as the UK's financial services regulator, move too quickly or narrowly, we could unintentionally stifle innovation. Also, any regulatory action could potentially become out-dated very quickly as the technology evolves at pace. A collaborative path forward: AI Live TestingAI Live Testing is a practical, hands-on way to build trust, reduce risk, and accelerate safe and responsible innovation. This isn’t a compliance exercise. It’s a partnership. It provides a structured but flexible space where firms can test AI-driven services in real-world conditions, with appropriate regulatory support and oversight (see the Terms of Reference (PDF)). It will help firms who are further along in AI development and are ready to use in markets. This will allow both sides to:Understand how an AI system performs in live market contexts – in practice and not just in theory.Identify potential risks early and adapt controls accordingly.Explore potential assurance methods that are grounded in how AI is used in a specific market context; not just what’s ideal on paper.Share insights that feed into smarter, more future-proof AI approaches.AI Live Testing complements the FCA's Supercharged Sandbox, which is focused on firms who are in the discovery and experiment phase of their AI product's development. This joined-up approach mirrors the spirit of innovation itself: test, learn, iterate, improve. It's a core part of the FCA's AI innovation offering through the AI Lab and set out in our Engagement Paper on AI Live Testing.Why you should take partWe know that complex questions around how AI systems will perform in the real world can significantly slow the pace of innovation. That's why we want to help firms by providing a place where they can test. AI Live Testing can offer you:Clarity on expectations: Get early, practical feedback on what regulators are looking for when it comes to, for example, considerations around explainability, fairness, performance, and controls. Less guesswork. Confidence in deployment: Test how your AI system behaves under real operating conditions to ensure it works in a safe and responsible way. A chance to shape best practice: Your experience in AI Live Testing helps inform insights and best practice for the rest of industry. You can help make sure that regulatory approaches are grounded in operational reality and make a genuine difference for the better for consumers and markets.What AI Live Testing isn't FCA AI Live Testing is not designed to become a tool to approve or certify that an AI model is OK to use. We don’t believe this is within the FCA's remit. It also isn't an enforcement or supervisory function – it's entirely voluntary.From model evaluation to AI system evaluation Much of the broader AI assurance debate has focused on how AI models operate. But when it comes to AI deployment, the model is just one part of a broader AI system. This is particularly true for financial services, where we need to understand how AI systems behave in real-world market situations. We define an AI system as an ecosystem of people, processes and technologies designed to deliver intended outcomes. It includes the model, data pipeline, human oversight, testing and governance. Considering the AI system as a whole is key to reducing bias, improving accuracy, and increasing transparency.And yet, our work to date suggests that some of the most important questions are more fundamental and even come before considering issues such as bias or accuracy. They are: What is the intended goal and outcome for the AI system – at a point in time and over time?What are the key risks relative to use case context, as well as considerations around regulatory compliance?How can these risks be best mitigated and what residual risks are acceptable? Do we have a shared framework to assess these risks? These are not academic questions. They’re about ensuring that the AI system is tested for its real-world impact – including its impact on consumers and markets (see ‘AI for growth – how the FCA can help’). These are live issues that respondents to our Engagement Paper on AI Live Testing are considering. We will be sharing more details when we publish the Feedback Statement in September 2025. AI Live Testing is a bridge between beneficial innovation and assurance. It gives you a structured way to take bold steps forward, with the reassurance that you're building on solid ground.We’re inviting financial firms of all sizes to take part. If you’re building something ambitious and want to get it right, this is your chance to test, learn, and lead.Join us in shaping the safe and responsible future of AI in UK financial markets.", "ingested_utc": "2025-08-14T06:45:04Z", "retrieved_utc": "2025-08-14T06:45:04Z"}

Liam Coleman joined the FCA board in November 2019. Liam will leave his current position as non-executive director at the FCA to take up his role at the Financial Ombudsman. He has over 30 years' experience in the banking industry in a variety of roles spanning retail and commercial banking and wholesale banking in his role as treasurer at 3 banking organisations. Current roles include chairman of Great Western Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and London and Quadrant Housing Trust, interim chair of Royal United Hospitals Bath NHS Foundation Trust, associate of the London Institute of Banking and Finance (ACIB) and an associate of the Association of Corporate Treasurers. He also holds an MBA from Warwick Business School. Previous board and leadership roles include chief executive officer of The Co-operative Bank plc, and deputy group treasurer and group head of capital management at RBS and group director, treasury at Nationwide Building Society.The Financial Ombudsman was set up to resolve complaints between financial businesses and their customers. It can help with most financial services – including banking, insurance, fraud and scams, PPI, loans, mortgages, pensions and investments. From 1 April 2019, its remit was extended to cover complaints from larger small and medium sized businesses and about claims management companies.Find out more information about the FCA.

An FCA investigation found that Mr Alba lacked integrity because he misled the FCA.Between April 2015 and November 2019, H2O failed to carry out proper due diligence on investments relating to the Tennor Group of companies owned by Lars Windhorst, or companies he introduced.The investments were high risk and hard to sell, leaving investor money trapped. In 2024, the FCA agreed that H2O would pay those investors €250 million.During the FCA’s investigation into H2O, Mr Alba provided false and misleading statements and documentation to the regulator. Mr Alba was the principal point of contact with the FCA during its investigation.Mr Alba asked junior colleagues to create minutes, including records and minutes of committees, where no formal meetings had taken place. Mr Alba also provided due diligence materials, such as investment research, to the FCA that had been created years after the investments had been made, when he had claimed they were produced at the time.Steve Smart, joint executive director of enforcement and market oversight, said:'Senior leaders in financial services need to act with integrity. Mr Alba fell well short of those basic standards.'He has no place in the industry. This ban and substantial fine should serve as a warning to others that if you mislead the FCA, you will face the consequences.'Notes to editorsRead the final notice (PDF)The FCA investigation found that Mr Alba breached APER Statement of Principle 1 (failed to act with integrity) and Statement of Principle 4 (failed to deal with the FCA in an open and cooperative way); and Individual Conduct Rule 1 (failed to act with integrity) and Individual Conduct Rule 3 (failed to deal with the FCA in an open and cooperative way).The FCA previously announced H2O would pay €250 million to affected investors following its investigation. Following its application to voluntarily cancel its permissions in the UK, H2O is no longer authorised in the UK. Mr Alba was previously identified in the final notice as 'Senior Manager A'.The French financial services regulator, the Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF), is the designated regulator in respect of the collective investments, which H2O had managed on a cross-border basis pursuant to the UCITS Directive.", "ingested_utc": "2025-08-14T06:45:04Z", "retrieved_utc": "2025-08-14T06:45:04Z"}

The latest missive from Mark Gurman at Bloomberg suggests that Apple is shifting its artificial intelligence goals to center on new device segments. Sources reportedly told the publication that Apple has a slate of new smart home products in the works that could help pivot its lagging AI strategy. The center of the new lineup is a tabletop AI companion that has been described as an iPad on a movable robotic arm. It would be able to swivel to face the screen toward a user as they move around their home or office. Sources said the current prototype uses a horizontal display that's about seven inches while the motorized arm can move the screen about six inches away from the base in any direction. Equipped with a long-promised overhaul to the Siri voice assistant, this device could act like an additional person, recalling information, making suggestions and participating in conversations. According to Bloomberg , Apple is targeting a 2027 release for this product. Apple's new lineup is also rumored to include a smart home hub that is a simpler version of the robotic friend with no moving stand. We might be seeing this sooner, with a projected 2026 release for the device. This hub device would be able to control music playback, take notes, browse the web and host videoconferencing. Both the robot companion and the smart home hub are reportedly running a new operating system called Charismatic that's designed to support multiple users. The Siri running on the device will be given a particularly cheery personality, and it may also be getting a visual representation. Bloomberg 's sources said there hasn't been a final decision on aesthetics; internal tests have had Siri looking like an animated Finder icon and like a Memoji. Today's scuttlebutt follows on previous reports from Gurman that pointed to Apple's interest in these categories. The idea of a smart home hub was apparently floated at the company as far back as 2022, and it's finally being rumored to have a formal debut some time this year. Robots have also been a topic of interest in Cupertino for some time, with claims that Apple was developing a personal robot dating back at least to last spring . While this Bloomberg piece offers more detail about those hypothetical plans, there's always a chance Apple will change direction or scrap a project.

After having hundreds of half-filled notebooks over the years, I, at some point, turned to digital tools instead because it was just easier to store everything on my phone or laptop so I always had my most important information at my fingertips. E-Ink tablets seem to provide the best of both worlds: the tactile satisfaction of regular notebooks with many of the conveniences found in digital tools, plus easy-on-the-eyes E-Ink screens. These devices have come a long way in recent years — now you can find them in multiple sizes, some have color E Ink screens and others double as full-blow ereaders with access to ebook stores and your local library’s offerings. I’ve tested out close to a dozen E Ink tablets over the past few years to see how well they work, how convenient they really are and which are the best tablets using E Ink screens available today. Table of contents Best E Ink tablets for 2025 Are E Ink tablets worth it? What to look for in an E Ink tablet Other E Ink tablets we've tested Best E Ink tablets for 2025 Are E Ink tablets worth it? An E Ink tablet will be a worthwhile purchase to a very select group of people. If you prefer the look and feel of an e paper display to LCD panels found on traditional tablets, it makes a lot of sense. They’re also good options for those who want a more paper-like writing experience (although you can get that kind of functionality on a regular tablet with the right screen protector) or a more distraction-free device overall. The final note is key here. Many E Ink tablets don’t run on the same operating systems as regular tablets, so you’re automatically going to be limited in what you can do. And even with those that do allow you to download traditional apps like Chrome, Instagram and Facebook, E Ink tablets are not designed to give you the best casual-browsing experience. This is mostly due to the nature of E Ink displays, which have noticeable refreshes, a lack of vibrant colors and lower picture quality than the panels you’ll find on even the cheapest iPad. Arguably the biggest reason why you wouldn’t want to go with an iPad (all models of which support stylus input, a plethora of reading apps, etc) is because it’s much easier to get distracted by email, social media and other Internet-related temptations. What to look for in an E Ink tablet Writing and latency Arguably the most important thing to consider when looking for an E Ink tablet is the writing experience. How good it is will depend a lot on the display’s refresh rate (does it refresh after every time you put pen to “paper,” or at a different regular interval) and the stylus’ latency. Most of the tablets I’ve tested have little to no latency, but some are certainly better than others. Finally, you should double check before buying that your preferred E Ink tablet comes with a stylus, or if you need to purchase one separately. Reading How much will you be reading books, documents and other things on this tablet? E Ink tablets come in many sizes, but most of them tend to be larger than your standard e-reader because it makes writing much easier. Having a larger display isn’t a bad thing, but it might make holding it for long periods slightly more uncomfortable. (Most e-readers are roughly the size of a paperback book, giving you a similar feeling to analog reading). The supported file types for e-books can also make a big difference. It’s hard to make a blanket statement here because this varies so much among E Ink tablets. The TL;DR is that you’ll have a much better reading experience if you go with one made by a company that already has a history in e-book sales (i.e. Amazon or Kobo). All of the titles you bought via the Kindle or Kobo store should automatically be available to you on your Kindle or Kobo E Ink tablet. Also with Kindle titles, specifically, since they are protected by DRM, it’s not necessarily the best idea to try to bring those titles over to a third-party device . Unless the tablet runs an operating system like Android that supports downloads for apps like Kindle and Kobo, you’ll be limited to supported file types, like ePUB, PDF, MOBI, JPEG, PNG and others. Search functionality Most E Ink tablets have some on-device search features, but they can vary widely between models. You’ll want to consider how important it is to you to be able to search through all your handwritten notes and markups. I noticed in my testing that Amazon’s and Kobo’s E Ink tablets made it easy to refer back to notes made in books and files because they automatically save to the specific pages on which you took notes, made highlights and more. Searching is less standardized on E Ink tablets that have different supported file types, but their features can be quite powerful in their own right. For example, a few devices I tested supported text search in handwritten notes along with handwriting recognition, the latter of which allows you to translate your scribbles into typed text. Sharing and connectivity While we established that E Ink tablets can be great distraction-free devices, most manufacturers understand that your notes and doodles aren’t created in a vacuum. You may want to access them elsewhere, and that requires some form of connectivity. All of the E Ink tablets I tried have Wi-Fi support, and some support cloud syncing, companion mobile apps and the ability to export notes via email so you can access them elsewhere. None of them, however, integrate directly with a digital note taking system like Evernote or OneNote, so these devices will always be somewhat supplementary if you use apps like that, too. I’d argue that, if you already lean heavily on apps like OneNote, a standard tablet with a stylus and screen protector might be the best way to go. Ultimately, you should think about what you will want to do with the documents you’ll interact with on your E Ink tablet after the tablet portion is done. Price E Ink tablets aren’t known for being cheap. They generally fall into the $300-$800 price range, which is what you can expect to pay for a solid regular tablet, too. A key factor in price is size: cheaper devices with E Ink displays are likely to have smaller screens, and stylus support isn’t as much of a given. Also, those types of devices are generally considered e-readers because of their size and may not be the best for note-taking, doodling and the like. E Ink tablets have gone up in price recently. Supernote and Onyx Boox increased prices, as did reMarkable. The former said it was due to \"increased costs,” and a reMarkable representative confirmed this to Engadget and provided the following statement: \"We regularly review our pricing based on market conditions and operational costs. We've communicated an upcoming adjustment for the US market effective in May to provide transparency to our customers. Multiple factors influence our pricing decisions, including supply chain dynamics and overall operational costs in specific markets.” As a result, the reMarkable Paper Pro jumped from $579 to $629 (that's for the bundle with the standard Marker and no Folio). This isn't great, considering the Paper Pro was already on the expensive side of the spectrum for E Ink tablets. It's also worth noting that Supernote and Onyx Boox have raised prices in the past few months as well. Other E Ink tablets we've tested Lenovo Smart Paper Lenovo made a solid E Ink tablet in the Smart Paper , but it's too pricey and too married to the company's companion cloud service to warrant a spot on our top picks list. The hardware is great, but the software isn't as flexible as those of competitors like the reMarkable 2. It has good Google Drive integration, but you must pair it with Lenovo's cloud service to really get the most use out of it — and in the UK, the service costs £9 per month for three months, which is quite expensive. Onyx Boox Tab Ultra The Boox Tab Ultra has a lot of the same features we like in the Note Air 2 Plus, but it’s designed to be a true, all-purpose tablet with an E Ink screen. Running Android 11 and compatible with a magnetic keyboard case, you can use it like a standard 2-in-1 laptop, albeit a low-powered one. You can browse the web, check email and even watch YouTube videos on this thing — but that doesn’t mean you should. A standard 2-in-1 laptop with a more responsive screen and better overall performance would be a better fit for most people who even have the slightest desire to have an all-in-one device. Like the rest of Onyx’s devices, the Tab Ultra is specifically for those who put reading and eye comfort above all else.

Samsung will once again keep the same overall design and features for its top-end Q990 soundbar. However, the company is adding a few new tools and it drastically reduced the size of the wireless subwoofer that comes in the box. Samsung does have one new model for 2025, the QS700F , that’s designed to sit on a table or automatically adjust to being mounted flat on a wall. Details are scarce on that soundbar for now and I anticipate a full spec sheet when the company is really to sell it. Of the big three TV companies, Sony is the only one that didn’t announce any home theater gear at CES. The company has decided to focus mainly on its automotive efforts at the show recently, leaving TV and audio announcements for later in the year. The company debuted multiple soundbar options in 2024 and a four-speaker setup for the living room in the Bravia Quad . That said, it wouldn’t surprise me if Sony released new soundbars later in the year since its most recent models were only announced last April. One company I would keep an eye on is Sennheiser. The original Ambeo model is nearly six years old and could use a refresh. The company has added medium and mini options to the Ambeo lineup since then, but it would be nice to see a refined version of the largest model too. The original Ambeo soundbar is huge, so no matter how good it sounds, it will always be a tough sell for some people. Although I think it’s less likely, it’s also possible that Sonos has new soundbars this year. While the company’s next device will likely be the rumored set-top streaming box, the Sound Motion tech inside the Arc Ultra would offer a big improvement to bass performance in compact models like the Beam and Ray . The company may bring Sound Motion to standalone speakers first, but it’s destined for those smaller soundbars eventually . The best soundbars for 2025 What to look for in a soundbar Features When it comes to features, the more you pay the more you're going to get in your new audio system. Most affordable options ($150 or less) will improve your television's audio quality, but that's about it. Step into the $300 to $400 range and you'll find all-in-one soundbars with things like built-in voice control, wireless connectivity, Google Chromecast, AirPlay 2 and even Android TV. They're all helpful when you want to avoid looking for the remote control, but the best playback quality is usually only in the top tier and the formats those premium soundbar systems support. I’m talking about things like Dolby Atmos, DTS:X and other high-resolution audio standards — essentials if you’re building a truly cinematic home entertainment setup. And not all Atmos soundbars are equal, so you'll need to look at the finer details carefully before you break into the savings account. If you're looking for one of the best Dolby Atmos soundbars, size, channels and subwoofer options will be important factors to consider. Some models even include a dedicated subwoofer to enhance bass performance, bringing an extra punch to action scenes and soundtracks. Ports This is a big one. A lot of the more affordable soundbars are limited when it comes to connectivity options. They either offer an optical port or one HDMI jack and, if you're lucky, both. Things get slightly better in the mid-range section, but that's not always the case. The Sonos Beam, for example, is $449, but only has a single HDMI port. Even at the higher-end, the $899 Sonos Arc still only has one HDMI port. If you plan to connect multiple devices like a set-top box, gaming laptop or console directly to your soundbar for the best audio experience, you’ll want an option with at least two HDMI (eARC) inputs. HDMI connections are critical for supporting Dolby Atmos and Dolby Digital audio formats, as well as high-res passthrough for HDR and 8K/4K content. Channels Another big thing you’ll want to pay attention to when looking for the best soundbar is channels. That’s the 2.1, 7.1.2 or other decimal number that companies include in product descriptions. The first figure corresponds to the number of channels. A two would just be left and right while a more robust Atmos system, especially one with rear surround speakers, could be five or seven (left, right, center and upward). The second number refers to the dedicated subwoofer, so if your new soundbar comes with one or has them built in, you’ll see one here. The third numeral is up-firing speakers, important for the immersive effect of Dolby Atmos. Not all Atmos-enabled units have them, but if they do, the third number will tell you how many are in play and how they contribute to the overall soundstage. Wireless Most soundbars these days offer either Bluetooth, Wi-Fi or both. When it comes to Wi-Fi, that connectivity affords you luxuries like voice control (either built-in or with a separate device), Chromecast, Spotify Connect and AirPlay 2. Depending on your preferences, you might be able to live without some of these. For me, AirPlay 2 and Chromecast are essentials, but the rest I can live without. Those two give me the ability to beam music and podcasts from my go-to apps without having to settle for — or struggle with — a Bluetooth connection. For instance, Sonos speakers often offer seamless integration with iOS devices, making it easy to connect and stream music wirelessly. If you’re looking for a wireless speaker that can enhance your TV setup while also offering flexibility for audio throughout the house, it's worth considering a multi-room system. Size This one might seem obvious but humor me for a minute. Nothing is more soul-crushing than getting a pricey soundbar in your living room only to discover you have to rearrange everything to find a spot for it. This was my plight when the Sennheiser Ambeo Soundbar arrived at my door. Yes, that speaker is absurdly large (and heavy), and most soundbars aren't nearly as big. I learned a valuable lesson: Make sure the space where you want to put a soundbar will accommodate the thing you're about to spend hundreds (if not thousands) of dollars on. Basically, it all comes down to the TV you have (or are planning to get) and what the primary goal is for your living-room audio. Is it ease of use? Do you want the best possible sound from a single speaker or speaker/sub combo? Do you just want to be able to actually hear your TV better? Or do you want a full home entertainment experience with crisp vocals, thunderous deep bass, and immersive surround system audio? By paying attention to each of those areas, you should have a good idea of what to look for in a soundbar, soundbar/subwoofer combo, Dolby Digital system or a more robust setup. With that said, we've put numerous products through their paces at Engadget and have a few favorites for best soundbar at various price points to get you started. Other soundbars we tested Sony Bravia Theater Bar 6 There’s a lot to like about the Bravia Theater Bar 6 , Sony’s new midrange option in its soundbar lineup. Sound quality is the speaker’s best attribute, even though it’s limited by its 3.1.2-channel configuration. The biggest two issues with this model are the lack of Wi-Fi connectivity — which means no AirPlay, Chromecast or Spotify Connect — and the need to use your computer and a thumb drive to install firmware updates. Neither of those should be things you have to consider on a $650 soundbar in 2025. Sonos Arc There’s no doubt that the Arc is Sonos’ best-sounding soundbar, but it’s also the company’s most expensive. With a new model based on the Arc rumored to be on the way , it’s difficult to recommend this product over the likes of Samsung and Sony. The Arc works well as both a soundbar and a speaker, and the device will fit in nicely with other Sonos gear you might already have for a multiroom setup. It only has one HDMI port though, where much of the competition allows you to connect streaming and gaming devices directly to their soundbars. Sennheiser Ambeo Soundbar Plus I don’t think Sennheiser’s medium-sized model offers enough to stand out from the more powerful Ambeo Soundbar Max or the Ambeo Soundbar Mini . The Mini is more affordable and does a solid job with immersive audio in its own right. Like the rest of the Ambeo lineup, there’s no option for satellite speakers as you can only add a subwoofer to the soundbars. However, the Ambeo Soundbar Plus does have RCA input, so you can use it with a turntable if you’re into vinyl. Best soundbar FAQs Is a soundbar better than speakers? It really depends on what you’re after. A soundbar is definitely a simpler, more compact solution compared to a full speaker setup. If you want better sound than your TV’s built-in setup but don’t want to deal with multiple speakers and wires everywhere, a soundbar is probably the way to go. Some soundbars can even deliver impressive surround sound effects, thanks to features like Dolby Atmos and virtual audio technology. However, if you’re an audiophile or want true surround sound for an at-home theater experience, a multi-speaker setup with a receiver, surround speakers and subwoofer will give you a richer soundstage and more control over your experience. What connection do I need for a soundbar? Most modern soundbars connect to your TV via HDMI ARC or eARC, which is the easiest and best option for achieving high-quality audio. If your TV supports this, all you need is an HDMI cable, and you’ll get not only great sound but also some extra features like controlling the soundbar with your TV remote. If HDMI ARC isn’t an option on your TV, you can use an optical cable, which also delivers solid audio quality. Some soundbars even offer Bluetooth or Wi-Fi connections for streaming music, and a few still have a 3.5mm aux jack for connecting to older devices. Do all soundbars come with subwoofers? Not all soundbars come with subwoofers, but many do or at least offer one as an optional add-on that you can purchase separately. A subwoofer is what gives you that deep, booming bass, so if you like action movies or want a fuller sound for music, having one can make a big difference. Some soundbars have a built-in subwoofer, but these generally don’t provide the same punch as a separate one.

But as much as I want the obvious GameCube classics on my Switch 2 , it’s the more underrated gems I’ve heard so much about from hardcore Nintendo fans over the years that really pique my interest. Games like Chibi-Robo! , for example, which Nintendo has confirmed as the next title joining the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion pack library on August 21. Say hello to Chibi-Robo! Join him on his quest to restore order to the Sanderson house and save the world in Chibi-Robo!, coming to Nintendo GameCube – Nintendo Classics on #NintendoSwitch2 for #NintendoSwitchOnline + Expansion Pack members on Aug 21! pic.twitter.com/BWjL2CbHdL — Nintendo of America (@NintendoAmerica) August 13, 2025 Chibi-Robo! is a 2005 platform-adventure game about a friendly little robot whose main goal is to help the Sanderson family by taking on various housework-related missions and performing generally good deeds on request. Chibi-Robo’s helpfulness isn’t limited to humans, though. In its quest to spread happiness, it also assists several animals and even enchanted toys along the way. As a player, you have to keep an eye on the robot’s battery life and use power outlets dotted around the house to recharge it. Fail to do so and it’ll collapse, and you’ll lose a chunk of the in-game currency you’ve collected. Chibi-Robo! looks like a typically charming Nintendo game in every respect, but it was actually originally conceived by now-defunct developer Skip Ltd. as a point-and-click adventure game, with Bandai as the publisher. Exactly how or why the game ended up moving over to Nintendo remains a mystery, but director Kenichi Nishi told Time Extension that Shigeru Miyamoto took a particular liking to the character design. The legendary Mario creator then went on to play something of an overseer role in the game’s development under its new publisher. Chibi-Robo! spawned a number of handheld spinoffs, but the original game remains the one with cult classic status. It’s also become increasingly hard to play over the years, with Nintendo choosing not to port the game forward. These days you can expect to pay as much as $200 for a second-hand physical copy. As someone who categorically does not have that kind of cash to chuck at a 20-year-old video game (or any game for that matter), I’m looking forward to seeing what all the fuss is about when it lands on Switch 2 next week.

Although the battle royale has been playable on current-gen consoles all along, it was running as a PS4 or Xbox One game. That helped it cast a wide net (and probably make more money), but it also came with technical limitations. The company said the move to current-gen will \"provide our players with a more stable gameplay environment on console and ensure a smoother, more seamless experience with future updates.\" PS5 players can expect the new version to play in 1440p at 60fps. Both the PS5 Pro and Xbox Series X will reach 2160p at 60fps. However, the two high-end systems will support Dynamic 4K resolution. Meanwhile, the Xbox Series S will run at 1080p at 60fps or 1440p at 30fps. (Your choice.) Here's how PUBG: Battlegrounds currently looks on PS5. PUBG / Krafton And this is how it will look after November 13. It's a subtle difference at first glance, but you can see more detail, including pronounced shadows. PUBG / Krafton When the cutoff arrives, the game will no longer be downloadable or playable on PS4 and Xbox One. PlayStation users will need to download a separate PS5 version of the game on November 13. If you already have it installed on your Xbox Series X/S, the current-gen update will install automatically via Microsoft's Smart Delivery . On both systems, your existing account data and purchased items will transition automatically. PUBG left its last-gen users a sentimental message that sounds a bit like a corporate layoff letter. \"We still vividly remember the epic battles, the heart-stopping moments, and the camaraderie that brought us together,\" the company wrote. \"We are deeply grateful for every moment you've spent with us over the past eight years.\" This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pubg-battlegrounds-will-leave-ps4-and-xbox-one-behind-later-this-year-162932937.html?src=rss", "ingested_utc": "2025-08-14T19:38:54Z", "retrieved_utc": "2025-08-14T19:38:54Z"}

Lego Voyagers is a physics-based, co-op puzzle game for two players. You and a buddy will each control Lego bricks as you attempt to rescue an abandoned spaceship. The blue and red pieces snap together with other blocks and can build structures to help navigate these worlds. You'll be able to play together locally on the same system or online.

If you take out a two-year NordVPN Plus plan (the company's most popular plan) it’ll cost you $108 for the duration of the contract, with Nord throwing in three extra months at no extra cost. That’s 73 percent off the usual rate. As well as Nord’s VPN service, a Plus plan also includes the Threat Protection Pro anti-malware tool, password management and an ad- and tracker-blocker. A Prime plan additionally comes with encrypted cloud storage or NordProtect, which insures you against identity theft and monitors dark web activity.

When Engadget’s Sam Chapman reviewed NordVPN earlier this year, he praised its excellent download speeds, exclusive features and extensive server network. Less impressive is its clunky interface and inconsistent design when jumping between different platforms running a NordVPN app. While it doesn't quite make the cut in our guide to the best VPNs available right now, it generally performed well in speed tests and Threat Protection Pro is really worth having.

The basic gameplay remains, with players being asked to feed, groom and play with small digital creatures inside a handheld device. But new features have also been added, like Bluetooth connectivity and downloadable content (they're also a little bigger than before). This month, however, Hasbro is throwing its hat into the ring with the Nano-Mals, a $20 device that takes the standard features of a virtual pet and aims them toward a new purpose: fidget toy. The first thing you’ll probably notice when you pick up one of the eight initial Nano-Mals models is how cute they all are: they’re styled after both common and uncommon animals, including two cows, two cats, a red panda, a narwhal, and a pair of unicorns.But the second thing you’ll notice is that there’s no screen to be found anywhere; instead, the sole “display” is a a light-up heart on the front of the toy that has three levels and changes color to indicate how satiated the toy is in terms of hunger, affection and play. How you fulfill these needs is where the Nano-mals distinguish themselves from other virtual pets: Instead of pushing buttons and navigating through various menus, you interact instead with the various parts of the toy directly. Push down on its ear to “pet” it, flip its arms to “dance” and push its nose to “feed” it. The more you perform these actions, the more each color of the heart will fill up, eventually resulting in a rainbow kaleidoscope across the toy’s chest. It’s incredibly easy to do, not just because these are simple actions, but because they’re engineered to be satisfying since it is a fidget toy. It feels good to flip the arms up and down and squish the ears. Not so much for pushing the shallow nose button though, meaning it was often the need that took the longest for me to fulfill. It just wasn’t fun to push the nose! I can only hope that future iterations improve on this. Once you’ve figured out the basic functions, it becomes a game in itself to figure out the best way to hold and interact with the device. You don’t need to look at it and the entire thing can be operated with one hand, which is exactly what you want in a fidget toy. I found myself rotating it between my fingers while flipping the arms – the device also contains an accelerometer so any significant movement also counts as “play.” If you have more than one Nano-mal – which is quite likely given the device’s low price – the toys will interact with each other, lighting up and talking to each other. It’s cute but also a bit unsettling, as it was very reminiscent of this year’s Black Mirror episode “Playthings” with the Nano-mals emitting mysterious bleats and chimes just like the Thronglets. Fortunately, there is an off switch, and the Nano-mals will burble happily before shutting down when you use it. Kris Naudus for Engadget However, the off switch isn’t absolute as, should you press any of the buttons, the Nano-mal will still react, though maybe not effusively as if the device were powered fully on. This is a problem given that the Nano-mal is meant to be taken out and about (there’s even a clip at the top), but will likely be banned from classrooms due to the possibility of it being accidentally triggered when a kid moves their stuff. The toys can be muted by holding down the nose for a few seconds, but it only works when the device is fully powered on, and resets every time the Nano-mal is turned off and on. Aside from that and the fact that I couldn’t remove the attachment clip, which got in the way when I was trying to spin the device in my hand, I think the Nano-mal is a solid first try at this kind of toy. Kids will love how cute they are, especially when you dress them up in the included clothes, which double as protective cases for the devices. And adults will appreciate them too: Parents are big on screen-free devices, while the young-at-heart will appreciate having something to keep their hands busy that isn’t their phone. The Nano-mals are available now at all major toy retailers, including Walmart and Amazon .

So instead of watchOS 12, I’ve spent the past two weeks with the public beta of watchOS 26. The naming scheme shift is subtle, but helpful — which is how I’d describe the upgrades the new software brings to the Apple Watch. The AI-powered Workout Buddy better contextualizes your Fitness data and an added gesture gives the watch a fun trick that’s actually helpful. Other upgrades — including better smart replies and the Liquid Glass treatment — all combine to make the watch work and look a bit better than it did before. It’s not a game-changing shift, like other OS 26 releases , but it manages to make a great watch a touch better. Luminous Liquid Glass Every Apple operating system got the Liquid Glass treatment this year, including watchOS 26. The change is less noticeable on the Apple Watch than on the iPhone or iPad, though. You’ll notice the semi-transparent buttons and flowy movement when entering your password and opening the control center — the icons look like they’re surrounded in little drops of water, which is quite pretty. You’ll see it on the Photos watch face, too, especially if you select the “glass” color for the time readout. The Liquid Glass treatment for the Photos watch face. Amy Skorheim for Engadget The Smart Stack now has a liminal glow and the app icons are likewise a touch more luminous than before. The effect is subtle and nicely unifies the look of the watch and its companion iPhone. Like all design upgrades, Liquid Glass made me feel like I was using a new watch — though, like everything, the novelty wore off after a week or two. Revamped Workout app combines AI stats with a DJ In addition to the Buddy, the Workout app has a new look with icons in each of the four corners of the screen that give you easier access to adjust your data view, play music, set goals and tweak Buddy settings. My favorite new feature is in the music menu and it’s limited to Apple Music for now. If you tap the music icon, you have the option to auto-play music. From there, you can also select “Picked for you” or “Choose media.” The former will select music that matches the type of workout you’re doing and what you like to listen to. As someone who gets derailed from pretty much all my tasks when I have to interact with my phone, I appreciate anything that can make decisions for me and prevent me from reaching for it. I was presented with peppy beats that matched the cadence of my run, from bands and artists that were familiar as well as new-to-me selections that fit my tastes. Unfortunately, it didn’t always work correctly. Sometimes I’d get no music, other times the music would play but the Workout Buddy would fall silent. I realize I’m testing a public beta of watchOS 26, so I’m holding out hope the feature will work at launch. Because when it worked, it was glorious. The new Workout app layout. Amy Skorheim for Engadget The new Workout Buddy is probably the biggest AI play in watchOS 26. It uses historical and real-time data collected by your watch to give you a window into how you’re performing at the beginning, end and throughout a workout. It works for walking, running, cycling and other workouts but requires headphones and a nearby Apple Intelligence- compatible iPhone. That gave me pause. I hate carrying stuff and/or sticking things in my ears when I run. But after acquiring some open earbuds and digging out my old Spibelt , I made it work. There are three voices to choose from as of this writing, a bright feminine option, a British male-sounding one and another female-presenting version with a lower register. These were built on vocal data from Fitness+ trainers and have an authentic sound to them. At the start of a workout, you’ll get a brief pep talk along with some recent milestones. My pre-game walking and running talks included references to the day of the week, my location and accumulated fitness data. For example, “Way to get out there on a Wednesday morning walk in Albuquerque. So far this week, you’ve done three walking workouts. Let’s get in some steps!” Depending on the type of exercise, you can set target ranges for cadence, heart rate, speed, distance, power (cycling), time and others. During a workout, the AI will let you know if you’re at, below or above those levels. The first time I tried Workout Buddy, my run was quite lonely. I didn’t realize I had to turn on the Buddy, as well as the various goal metrics within the Workout app. I did that and, on my next run, the AI delivered cadence and heart rate updates, and let me know when I hit milestones like distance and duration. At the end of a workout, you’ll see a thinking animation as the AI assembles a summary. It’ll recap data like your pace, distance, average and peak heart rate, as well as progress on your Activity rings. It’ll also point out comparisons or cumulative milestones you may have hit. For example, after a longer walk, it told me that I’d just burned the most calories on a walk so far. Another day, it told me I’d walked ten miles so far this week. It closes the update by encouraging you to take the energy into the rest of your day or something similarly positive but measured. That’s a big improvement over the first few times I used the feature. My first few pep talks were cloying, telling me something along the lines of “It’s not easy to get out there early in the morning!” and “Your effort is inspiring!\" After I stopped a run early to fuss with settings, it told me I did a “Great job!” on a three-minute run. Thankfully, Apple appears to be tweaking the Buddy behind the scenes, calibrating the AI’s “personality.” Recent pep talks have become noticeably less sycophantic and therefore more enjoyable. I imagine the Buddy will only continue to evolve even more from here. The Workout Buddy is not a coach The Workout Buddy is a motivational experience that provides personalized insights you can use to gauge your performance. But I just finished trying out Samsung’s AI running coach on the Galaxy Watch and couldn’t help comparing the two. That coach pushed me to run five kilometers for the first time in my life. The Buddy made me feel like I’d accomplished something special just by taking my dog on a stroll. Both have their place, but I’d say Apple’s version is probably best for those who already know what their goals are and what they need to do to hit them. Samsung’s version may be better for beginners who want some help shaping their fitness journey. In addition to the Buddy, the Workout app has a new look with icons in each of the four corners of the screen that give you easier access to adjust your data view, play music, set goals and tweak Buddy settings. My favorite new feature is in the music menu and it’s limited to Apple Music for now. If you tap the music icon, you have the option to auto-play music. From there, you can also select “Picked for you” or “Choose media.” The former will select music that matches the type of workout you’re doing and what you like to listen to. As someone who gets derailed from pretty much all my tasks when I have to interact with my phone, I appreciate anything that can make decisions for me and prevent me from reaching for it. I was presented with peppy beats that matched the cadence of my run, from bands and artists that were familiar as well as new-to-me selections that fit my tastes. Unfortunately, it didn’t always work correctly. Sometimes I’d get no music, other times the music would play but the Workout Buddy would fall silent. I realize I’m testing a public beta of watchOS 26, so I’m holding out hope the feature will work at launch. Because when it worked, it was glorious. More hands-free fun with wrist flick I love the double tap gesture Apple introduced with the Apple Watch Series 9 — it’s a pleasure to stop timers, start auto-detected workouts and answer calls without getting my other hand involved. But it took some practice before I could reliably get the watch to recognize the gesture. (The trick is raising your wrist in an exaggerated checking-the-time motion then quickly, but not too quickly, tapping your thumb and finger together twice.) Luckily, the new Wrist Flick motion introduced in watchOS 26 takes practically no effort to get right. It involves quickly turning the back of your wrist away from you and back up again. Doing that can silence a call, stop a ringing timer, dismiss notifications and return you to the watch face from any app you open. It also makes those irritating helpful “Time to stand!” reminders go away. The wrist flick doesn’t clear alerts, just dismisses them — so the red indicator dot disappears, but the notification remains and you can see it if you swipe down. Just note that it’s only available to Apple Watch Series 9, 10 and the Ultra 2. Amy Skorheim for Engadget Wrist flick is a great feature — though it's important to note that Android wearables since WearOS 2 had a similar feature for a while now. And I’d like to see Apple adopt more hands-free interactions like this. Apple already has many gesture-based controls as part of its existing AssistiveTouch feature. Actions like fist clenches, wrist tilts and single or double taps can control most of the navigation on the watch. Unfortunately, turning on AssistiveTouch turns off the universal double tap feature. I’d be interested in seeing something that splits the difference. Perhaps four or five gestures for basic functions that can be used in conjunction with screen input. Smarter replies could make Messages a usable watch app The Apple Watch is great for reading texts, but replying is awkward. That tiny keyboard is an interface for ants — even talk-to-text input is inefficient as it’s tough to correct mistakes. Smart Replies are little canned responses that appear as suggestions below the reply field. Those aren’t new, but now Series 9 watches and later will use an improved on-device language model to come up with relevant bits of text you can send with a tap. In addition to the choices that are always offered — Okay, Yes, No, Thank you and Can I call you later? — I saw things like “Ok, let me know” and “That’s so sweet!” both of which applied to their respective conversations. I wasn’t always given Smart Reply suggestions, and some of them weren’t very relevant, but again, it’s a great feature that will save time when it works. Another Messages update is a carryover from iOS 26 (and borrowed from countless other messaging apps). You can now set custom backgrounds for each of your (Apple-only) contacts. Just note that whatever you set will be seen by all participants in the conversation, once they update to iOS 26. On your watch, the photo, gradient or pattern you pick carries over to your conversations. Not only does it look nice, I find backgrounds help me to not accidentally text my mom something I meant to send to my sister. Backgrounds are now available in Messages. Amy Skorheim for Engadget Notes have arrived The Notes app is now on Apple Watch. I honestly hadn’t noticed the lack before this — I know there are plenty of Notes enthusiasts out there, but in my world, Alexa handles all reminder and shopping list duties. Still, I can see how the new integration could come in handy. After creating a simple shopping checklist in the iOS Notes app, I opened the list on my watch while I was shopping and found it far easier to check things off on my wrist than dragging out my phone every time I stuck something in my cart. I’m curious to see whether Apple’s improved prediction algorithms for the new OS will eventually add Notes to my Smart Stack suggestions after I open the Notes app a few times at the grocery store. As it stands now, the Notes widget will pop up first in the Smart Stack if that’s the last app you used. The rest of the new stuff Face Gallery The iPhone Watch app has a new look and now organizes watch faces by category instead of by name. Groupings include New, Clean, Data-rich, Photos and Health and Fitness, among others. It’s certainly an improvement, but one that makes you wonder why it wasn’t always like this. The Watch Face gallery is categorized now. Amy Skorheim for Engadget Adaptive sound Another nice-but-obvious update adjusts the volume of pings and beeps to fit the environment — quieter in a noiseless office and louder at a raucous BBQ. I set a timer to go off when I was quietly working at my desk and then again with loud music playing and I couldn’t really tell the difference. But that’s a hard metric for the humble human ear to judge. Again, this is a feature reserved for Series 9 models and later. Smart Stack The Smart Stack will now add a small prompt to your watch face when it detects certain situations. For example, if you open the camera app on your phone, a small camera icon appears at the bottom of your watch screen, as a suggestion to open the remote shutter. Apple gives other examples, such as showing the workout icon when you arrive at your usual pilates studio or the Backtrack navigation feature when you journey away from cellular connectivity. I didn’t see the prompt very often, but I did notice that the Smart Stack rearranged itself according to my habits — such as putting the medication widget at the top of the stack right around the time it was time to take my prescription, or shuffling Shazam to the top when it hears music playing. Siri is still Siri Coming fresh off of reviewing the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8, I can’t help but notice a stark difference between that wearable’s fully integrated, AI-powered Gemini and Apple’s same-old Siri. Gemini on the Samsung watch helped me find new stuff in my city, performed convoluted tasks and answered some pretty esoteric questions. I use Siri on my watch to reliably set timers, text people and add events to my calendar. But it’s not quite on the level of Gemini’s contextually-aware, generative capabilities that can interact with multiple apps. Asking something like “Where should I have lunch?” gave me a list of businesses with lunch in the name followed by Siri asking me: “Which one?” Not sure what that meant. Gemini, on the other hand, gave me local and relevant ideas for places I’d actually want to eat. Even before AI swallowed everyone’s mind, I had a soft spot for digital assistants. When Alexa sings the “You’re very, very, oh so very welcome” song, I get a dopey smile on my face. I’ve tried to love Siri, but I get frustrated by being misunderstood, misdirected, misheard and flat-out ignored. I know Apple doesn’t like to release new tech until it’s fully up to snuff, and I’m looking forward to seeing what finally happens with new Siri. But for now, the disparity shows. Wrap-up The changes watchOS 26 brings to the Apple Watch are perhaps not as grand as those for other Apple devices. Liquid Glass here isn’t as all-encompassing as it is on the iPhone . The new watch features don’t make the wearable finally realize its full potential like iPad OS 26 does for the tablet. And there isn’t one major feature upgrade that transforms the watch experience, like macOS 26 does with Spotlight on Macs. But the updates do push the experience of using the watch forward. Liquid Glass is pretty and nicely ties the wearable with its companion devices. The Workout app, which was already good at tracking fitness metrics, is even better with the Workout Buddy, providing stat summaries and automated playlists. Improved smart replies for Messages and the addition of the Notes app fix two of the watch’s previous shortcomings. And the wrist flick adds another option for hands-free interaction and — I hope — is a precursor to more such utility. I’m still holding out hope for an improved, personable and helpful Siri once Apple is ready, but for now, these are all welcome upgrades for what’s already the industry’s best overall smartwatch.

The plant itself detaches from the pot, so the camera can be used in portable mode by popping it into the USB port at the top of the console. There's also a built-in privacy shutter. Just close the plant's mouth to obscure the lens. The actual camera specs here aren't going to win any awards, with a frame rate of 30FPS and a resolution of 640 x 480p. However, that's more than enough to capture footage of your floating head to accompany your kart as it races through the Mushroom Kingdom.

Kwon's story is a wild one involving an immense crypto crash , an Interpol manhunt and Kwon's eventual extradition from Montenegro to the United States. Kwon, along with Sam Bankman-Fried and others, was a key player in 2022's crypto collapse . His company Terraform created a \"stablecoin\" called TerraUSD supposedly pegged to the US dollar, along with a floating crypto coin called Luna. When TerraUSD fell below its $1 peg in May of 2021, Kwon secretly arranged for a trading firm to buy the currency to boost its price. However, he lied to investors and said he stabilized the coin using a specialized algorithm. Those investors believed the story and bought up Luna (closely tied to TerraUSD), to the tune of nearly $50 billion, according to US prosecutors. Both currencies subsequently collapsed, taking $40 billion of investor money with it. As it often works with such things, many regular people lost their life savings , while venture capital firms profited before the rug was pulled. Following the collapse, Kwon was put on wanted lists in both the US and South Korea, with investigators in the latter country enlisting Interpol to find the entrepreneur. He subsequently posted on X that he \"wasn't on the run\" and was extradited to the US last year on New Year's Eve. Kwon was originally charged with nine counts including securities fraud, wire fraud, commodities fraud and money-laundering conspiracy. Though facing up to 25 years, he may receive a reduced sentence of 12 years maximum provided he accepts responsibility for his crimes. \"I made false and misleading statements about why [TerraUSD] regained its peg by failing to disclose a trading firm’s role in restoring that peg,” Kwon said. “What I did was wrong.” Earlier, Kwon agreed to pay an $80 million civil fine and be banned from crypto transactions as part of a $4.55 billion US Securities and Exchange Commission settlement. Prosecutors will allow Kwon to be transferred to South Korea after half his US sentence is served.

If you're looking to upgrade from an old pair or want a fresh set for the new school year, you can pick up the AirPods Pro 2 for $169 right now. That's 32 percent off their usual price and one of the best prices we've seen this year. Apple’s flagship AirPods were $100 off — a record-low $149 — during Prime Day, so we have seen them even cheaper than this, but for a non-sale period, Amazon’s current deal is worth considering. The AirPods Pro 2 are our top choice for iPhone users looking for wireless earbuds, thanks to much beefier sound than the original model, rock solid ANC and transparency modes, and seamless switching between Apple devices. Throw in spatial audio support, hands-free Siri and more than acceptable battery life, and the AirPods Pro 2 are hard to top. Not everyone gets on with the sometimes fiddly touch gestures, but a lot of wireless headphones struggle with this. If there’s anything to give you pause, it’s that we might be getting the AirPods Pro 3 sooner rather than later. But if that’s the case, you can be confident you’ll pay a lot more than $169 for the privilege. The AirPods Pro aren’t the only discounted AirPods right now. The AirPods 4 (without ANC) are down to $99. Usually priced at $129, you’re saving $30 on a much improved entry-level AirPods offering. They fit and sound better than any non-Pro AirPods before them, and inherit some previously Pro-only features thanks to the H2 chip. If you travel a lot you’ll also certainly rue the lack of ANC, but if that isn’t a deal breaker for you, the $99 price point might be tempting.

The Netflix animated film has become a global hit since it launched on the platform and has reportedly become the second most-watched movie on the service's history after Red Notice . Now, Netflix is holding a limited theatrical event, wherein fans can watch a sing-along version of the film. Aside from the movie itself being a hit, its songs have gained massive popularity, with the track Golden recently taking the number one spot on the Billboard Hot 100. KPop Demon Hunters is a musical that revolves around the girl group Huntr/x, which as you might have guessed, are demon hunters. The group is the latest trio of women who uses the power of their singing voices to maintain the Honmoon, or the magical barrier that prevents demons from entering our world established generations ago by the first trio of singing demon hunters. In the film, they're in constant competition with a boy band called Saja Boys, who are made up of demons that look like pretty boys. The main antagonist, however, is Gwi-Ma, ruler of the demons. He was voiced by Lee Byung-hun, whom a lot of people might know as the Front Man in Squid Game. The film's limited theatrical release will only last for one weekend, from August 23 to 24, in select screens across the US and Canada. You can buy tickets starting today, August 13, at 9AM Eastern time, from the even't official website , where you can also view the full list of theaters and showtimes in your area.

The startup, called Merge Labs, will use AI for its brain-computer interface and compete directly with Neuralink, along with other nascent companies in the field like Precision Neuroscience and Synchron. The name Merge Labs comes from a term Altman used in 2017 called \"the merge\" that describes the moment human brains and computers come together. The company will raise funds, most from OpenAI's ventures team, that will set its valuation at $850 million. Altman will co-found Merge Labs with Alex Blania (from World, an eyeball scanning company also backed by OpenAI) but won't invest any capital himself, according to three people with direct knowledge of the project. Altman has been interested in the topic of machine-brain interfaces for years and suggested in the 2017 article above that the merge could arrive as soon as 2025 (it didn't). More recently, he wrote in another blog post a \"high-bandwidth brain-computer interface\" could soon be developed with the aid of recent tech advances. Altman's Merge Labs will be a direct competitor to Musk's Neuralink, intensifying the rivalry between the two that kicked off when Musk left OpenAI's board in 2018. Mind link technology has existed for decades now , but recent advances in implant tech and AI have allowed researchers to collect and process higher signal levels from the brain. Neuralink started its first human trials in January 2024 with quadriplegic subject Noland Arbaugh and later implanted its tech into a second anonymous subject. That subject, \"Alex,\" has reportedly been able to play FPS games and create 3D designs, while suffering from fewer issues and side effects as Arbaugh.

In a post on X , OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has revealed that the chatbot's model picker now comes with three GPT-5 choices: Auto, Fast and Thinking. He said most \"will want Auto,\" which is most likely the standard version that's already a reasoning model. But users will be able to choose the fast-responding version or the Thinking version that implies it delivers longer, more comprehensive answers if they want to. GPT-4o is now also back in the model picker for all paying users by default. OpenAI removed GPT-4o with the launch of GPT-5: The company significantly simplified ChatGPT because GPT-5 was supposed to offer a unified experience for users. However, its decision was met by criticism from people who preferred GPT-4o's personality better, especially since it didn't give them notice that it was deprecating older models. In his post, Altman promised users that if the company ever does deprecate GPT-4o, OpenAI \"will give plenty of notice.\" In addition to the GPT-5 and GPT-4o models, users can toggle to \"Show additional models\" in ChatGPT web settings if they want to access o3, 4.1, and GPT-5 Thinking mini. GPT-4.5 is only available to subscribers paying for the $200-a-month Pro tier, though, because it \"costs a lot of GPUs.\" Altman said that GPT-5 Thinking now has rate limits of 3,000 messages a week, after which users will only be able to use GPT-5 Thinking mini. He has also revealed that OpenAI is working to update GPT-5's personality to make it warmer, but \"not as annoying (to most users) as GPT-4o.\" Updates to ChatGPT: You can now choose between “Auto”, “Fast”, and “Thinking” for GPT-5. Most users will want Auto, but the additional control will be useful for some people.

Razer is now catering to those folks with two new PC gamepads, the wireless Wolverine V3 Pro 8K PC and wired Wolverine V3 Tournament Edition 8K PC . The key feature is right there in the names, with 8,000Hz polling speeds that promise high responsiveness for demanding pro or serious players. The Wolverine V3 Pro 8K PC offers 8,000Hz polling in both wired and wireless modes, meaning player inputs are recognized nearly instantly. By contrast, Razer's Wolverine V3 Pro designed for Xbox and PC (which we liked) tops out at just 1,000Hz. The V3 Pro 8K PC model also uses Tunnel Magnetoresistance (TMR) thumbsticks with swappable caps for long life, consistent tension and superior anti-drift performance over time. That model is also Razer's lightest wireless esports controller yet and features an ergonomic shape to reduce hand fatigue. Other features include 4 mouse click back buttons and 2 claw grip bumpers, Razer Pro HyperTriggers, Mecha-Tactile PBT Action Buttons, an 8-way floating D-Pad and Razer's Synapse customization. It comes with a carrying case and 2m braided cable and is now available for $200. Razer also launched a wired-only model called the Wolverine V3 Tournament Edition PC. It offers most of the same features, like the 8,000Hz HyperPolling tech, TMR anti-drift thumbsticks, HyperTriggers, Mecha-Tactile PBT buttons and Synapse customization. It also comes with a 2m braided cable and is now available for $120 — a very reasonable price for a competition-level gamepad.

In particular, the Tracing system fixes the slotsMissed_int metric, while networking improvements include Windows socket fixes, reduced caching time of DNS lookup errors, refined PeerSharing configuration behavior (see networking changes below for details), and the deprecation of --non-producer-node in favor of --start-as-non-producer-node command line switch for starting the node. This release also removes a number of irrelevant binaries from the Node artifacts and adds tx-generator . Benchmarking reports relevant to the 10.5.1 release can be found in this post on Cardano Updates . System testing results for the 10.5.1 release can be found on the corresponding tag testing page . Please note the changed default behavior for PeerSharing for relay nodes, but not for block producers. This reflects the recommendations for mainnet usage -- mainnet block producers may not meet the Praos performance guarantees if PeerSharing is enabled and IP will also be leaked, but this is not an issue for relays. Known issues There is a known bug when starting from a Byron snapshot. The node will reject the snapshot and replay the chain from the start. However the time it takes to replay the Byron era is small, and very few users are expected to need to start the node from a Byron snapshot. Therefore the issue will be fixed in 10.6.0.

For this purpose, the node is considered a BP if any of the protocol files are present at startup. The default can be overridden by explicitly setting the PeerSharing key in the configuration file to the desired value.

So how did Huang do it – and will he be able to see off Donald Trump’s tariff regime and navigate the difficulties of doing business during Trump’s trade war with China?

I have seen an economy that has the ingredients for success – a skilled and committed workforce, world-class universities, innovative businesses. You don’t hear Reform or the Conservatives talk of this success. They want you to believe the economy is broken. That our best days are behind us and that the path of decline is inevitable. I fundamentally reject that. It is not the country I see around us, and it is not the future I believe in. Britain’s economy is not broken, but I know that in recent years it has got stuck.

Rachel Reeves’s metaphor in her Mansion House speech last month about regulation in too many areas acting as “a boot on the neck of business” felt wildly over the top when you remember why tougher financial rules were needed in the banking sector in the first place. It was because the light-touch regulatory era caused the whole economy to be clobbered in the collapses of 2008-09. In the event, it took until 2019 to implement fully the centrepiece of the clean-up operation: bank ringfencing, which requires UK banks of a certain size to separate their retail and investment banking activities. Now, six years later – no time at all in the grand scheme – the Treasury, lobbied by most of the big banks, is contemplating “meaningful” changes to ringfencing in the interests of economic growth . It feels far too soon to try anything radical. Continue reading...", "ingested_utc": "2025-08-14T16:32:53Z", "retrieved_utc": "2025-08-14T16:32:53Z"}

A contemporary reworking would need to start from a radically different premise. Notwithstanding the contribution of a large migrant workforce, the modern construction sector is underpowered and dramatically understaffed. Annual job vacancies total about 38,000, half of which cannot be filled due to a shortage of skills. For a government committed to sustainably building 1.5m new homes and environmentally upgrading the existing housing stock – as well as renewing national infrastructure more generally – that is a serious problem.

First, economic data made it look highly improbable that Rachel Reeves could fulfil existing spending pledges, while also sticking within her self-imposed fiscal rules, on current revenue projections.

The settlement fee will be used to provide redress to injured customers of Match Group's dating services, which include Match.com, Tinder, Hinge, OkCupid, and PlentyOfFish. The agency sued Match Group in 2019 on a series of allegations. According to the complaint, the dating service company had used misleading ads to encourage subscriptions and then made it difficult for customers to cancel those subscriptions. Match Group was also accused of locking customers out of their accounts when they attempted to dispute billing charges. In addition to the payment, Match Group has agreed to clearly and conspicuously disclose the terms of its \"six-month guarantee,\" as well as any conditions or limitations to those offers. It will also offer simple mechanisms for customers to cancel their subscriptions. Finally, Match Group will not retaliate or take action against customers who file billing disputes, and it won't deny those customers access to paid-for services or goods. Match Group also drew scrutiny earlier this year after an investigation claimed that it had failed to act on reports of sexual assault and made little effort to keep abusive or dangerous users from rejoining other dating platforms it owns.

The department also includes archival workers and historians for Blizzard franchises, such as World of Warcraft and Overwatch . A spokesperson from CWA said that there will be about 169 workers from the company joining the local chapter. \"After more than a decade working at Blizzard, I've seen all the highs and lows. For years, Blizzard has been a place where people could build their careers and stay for decades, but that stability's been fading,\" Bucky Fisk, a principal editor and member of the organizing committee, said. \"With a union, we're able to preserve what makes this place special, secure real transparency in how decisions are made, and make sure policies are applied fairly to everyone.\" \"These past couple of months have felt both important and cathartic given what's happened to video game workers across the industry,\" said Sammi Kay, another member of the organizing committee and an associate producer at Blizzard. \"At multiple points in my life, I've always been told to accept the way things are, but with organizing, we're able to build a future better than we found it.\" Blizzard is owned by Microsoft. Today's development marks the latest move for game developers under the tech giant's umbrella to pursue union representation. About 600 quality assurance workers from Activision joined CWA last March.

It was a world away from this summer’s heatwaves, which have pushed Britain to the brink of drought. But Tester’s choice of heat pump design has meant that his three-bedroom 1930s semi in West Sussex has remained at a comfortable temperature despite Britain’s increasingly volatile weather. The air-to-air heat pump provides heating in the winter but acts like an air conditioner in the summer months.

As I’ve said in the past , debanking law-abiding customers is unacceptable and regulators must work to end it. The FDIC has taken several actions to further that objective, and soon, we plan to issue a rulemaking that would prohibit examiners from criticizing institutions on the basis of reputational risk or directing or encouraging institutions to close accounts on the basis of political, social, religious, or other views. Consistent with the Executive Order, the FDIC also plans to review whether FDIC-supervised institutions have engaged in politicized or unlawful debanking. The FDIC looks forward to working with our interagency partners to ensure that all law-abiding individuals and businesses have access to bank accounts, and that the era of debanking politically disfavored customers is over. # # # MEDIA CONTACT: mediarequests@fdic.gov The FDIC does not send unsolicited email.

These banks were required to submit resolution plans by July 1, 2025. Resolution plans, commonly known as living wills, are required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. These plans describe a banking organization’s strategy for orderly resolution under bankruptcy in the event of material financial distress or failure. By regulation, resolution plans must be divided into public and confidential sections. To foster transparency, the agencies have required each banking organization’s public section to summarize certain elements of the resolution plan. In addition, the FDIC released public sections of the separate resolution plans of 12 large insured depository institutions (IDIs), which are required under the FDIC’s IDI Rule. These IDI resolution plans, which were also required to be submitted by July 1, 2025, are designed to enable the FDIC to efficiently resolve an IDI under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act in the event of its failure. The public sections of the resolution plans are available on the FDIC's and the Board’s websites. # # # MEDIA CONTACT: Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Carroll Kim (202) 898-7389 Federal Reserve Board Karolina Kalset (202) 898-7389 The FDIC does not send unsolicited email.

The CRA is a 1977 law that requires the FDIC to assess a bank’s record of meeting the credit needs of its entire community, including those of low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with safe and sound operations. As part of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA), Congress mandated the public disclosure of an evaluation and rating for each bank or thrift that undergoes a CRA examination on or after July 1, 1990. You may obtain a consolidated list of all state nonmember banks whose evaluations have been made publicly available since July 1, 1990, including the rating for each bank, or obtain a hard copy from FDIC's Public Information Center, 3501 Fairfax Drive, Room E-1002, Arlington, VA 22226 (877-275-3342 or 703-562-2200). A copy of an individual bank's CRA evaluation is available directly from the bank, which is required by law to make the material available upon request, or from the FDIC's Public Information Center.
