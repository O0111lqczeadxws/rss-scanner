The best noise-canceling headphones block out distractions and let you enjoy your music, podcasts or calls in peace — all while delivering great sound quality and all-day comfort. From models with plush cushions to wireless cans with loads of extra features, there’s something here for every style and budget. Table of contents Best noise-canceling headphones for 2025 How to choose the best noise-canceling headphones for you How we test noise-canceling headphones Other noise-canceling headphones we tested Noise-canceling headphones FAQs Best noise-canceling headphones of 2025 How to choose the best noise-canceling headphones for you Design When you’re shopping for the best wireless headphones, the first thing you’ll need to decide on is wear style. Do you prefer on-ear or over-ear headphones? For the purposes of this guide, I focus on the over-ear style as that’s what most noise-canceling headphones are nowadays. Sure, you can find on-ear models with ANC, but over-ear, active noise-canceling headphones are much more effective at blocking outside sounds since your ears are completely covered. For gamers, there are also gaming headsets that feature noise cancellation — some even have detachable microphones, so they can double as over-ear headphones. However, for the purpose of this article, we’re only going to be focusing on noise-canceling headphones rather than headsets. Look for models with a comfortable headband and memory foam ear cups to ensure you can wear them for long periods without discomfort. Many headphones also come with a range of color options, so if aesthetics matter to you, you’ll find plenty of choices beyond just black or white. Whether you’re looking for something neutral or a bold pop of color, brands now offer a variety of styles to match your personal taste. Finally, if you’re planning to wear your headphones for long periods of time, it’s important to pick a model with a comfortable fit. Memory foam ear cups, an adjustable headband, and lightweight materials can make all the difference during extended listening sessions. After all, great sound is only part of the equation; comfort matters just as much. Type of noise cancellation Next, you’ll want to look at the type of ANC a set of headphones offers. You’ll come across terms like “hybrid active noise cancellation” or “hybrid adaptive active noise cancellation,” and there are key differences between the two. A hybrid ANC setup uses microphones on the inside and on the outside of the device to detect outside noise and cancel it out. By analyzing input from both mics, a hybrid system can combat more sounds than “regular” ANC, but it does so at a constant level that doesn’t change. Adaptive ANC takes the hybrid configuration a step further by continuously adjusting the noise cancellation for changes in your environment and any leakage around the padding of the ear cups. Adaptive noise-canceling also does a better job with wind noise, which can really kill your vibe while using headphones outdoors. Some high-end headphones also support Dolby Atmos, which enhances spatial audio and makes everything from music to movies sound more immersive. For the purposes of this best headphones list, I’m only considering products with hybrid ANC or adaptive ANC setups because those are the most effective at blocking noise and improving your overall listening experience. Customization You’ll also want to check to see if the ANC system on a prospective set of headphones offers adjustable levels of noise cancellation or presets. These can help you dial in the amount of ANC you need for various environments, but it can also help you save battery life. Master & Dynamic, for example, has ANC presets that provide both maximum noise blocking and more efficient cancellation that is more energy efficient. Other companies may include a slider in their companion apps that let you adjust the ANC level to your liking. Some high-end models even allow you to fine-tune the ANC for specific types of environments. How we test noise-canceling headphones The primary way we test headphones is to wear them as much as possible. I prefer to do this over a one-to-two-week period, but sometimes deadlines don’t allow it. During this time, I listen to a mix of music and podcasts , while also using the headphones to take both voice and video calls. Since battery life for headphones can be 30 hours or more, I drain the battery with looping music and the volume set at a comfortable level (usually around 75 percent). Due to the longer battery estimates, I’ll typically power the headphones off several times and leave them that way during a review. This simulates real-world use and keeps me from having to constantly monitor the process for over 24 straight hours. To test ANC performance specifically, I use headphones in a variety of environments, from noisy coffee shops to quiet home offices. When my schedule allows, I use them during air travel since plane noise is a massive distraction to both work and relaxation. Even if I can’t hop on a flight, I’ll simulate a constant roar with white noise machines, bathroom fans, vacuums and more. I also make note of how well each device blocks human voices, which are a key stumbling block for a lot of ANC headphones. ANC-related features are something else to consider. Here, I do a thorough review of companion apps, testing each feature as I work through the software. Any holdovers from previous models are double checked for improvements or regression. If the headphones I’m testing are an updated version of a previous model, I’ll spend time getting reacquainted with the older set. Ditto for the closest competition for each new set of headphones that I review. Other noise-canceling headphones we tested AirPods Max Apple’s AirPods Max are premium, well-designed over-ear headphones that incorporate all of the best features you find on standard AirPods: solid noise cancellation, spatial audio and easy Siri access. However, their $550 starting price makes them almost prohibitively expensive, even for Apple users. There are better options available at lower prices, but if you can pick up the AirPods Max at a steep discount, they might be worthwhile for the biggest Apple fans among us. Dyson On-Trac The On-Trac headphones have an almost infinitely customizable design, and that’s what’s most unique about them. The sound profile offers some nice detail, but lacks dynamic range overall. ANC is average at best and there aren’t any advanced features that will make your life easier. Well, except for the hearing health monitor, which is actually handy. All told, that’s not a lot for a set of $500 headphones. Sonos Ace The Sonos Ace is an excellent debut for the company’s first headphones. The combination of refined design, great sound quality and home theater tricks creates a unique formula. However, ANC performance is just okay and key functionality is still in the works for many users. Sony ULT Wear If most headphones don’t have the level of bass you desire, the ULT Wear is an option to consider. The low-end thump isn’t for everyone, but there are also plenty of handy features and a refined look to make the $200 set more compelling than many in this price range. Beats Studio Pro The Studio Pro lacks basic features like automatic pausing, and multipoint connectivity is only available on Android. Moreover, they’re not very comfortable for people with larger heads. Overall sound quality is improved, though, and voice performance on calls is well above average. Master & Dynamic MH40 (2nd gen) The MH40 are a great set of headphones if you favor crisp, clear and natural sound that isn’t overly tuned. This pair showcases the company’s affinity for leather and metal too, but limited customization and short battery life for non-ANC cans kept this set from making the cut. Bowers & Wilkins Px8 The company’s trademark pristine sound is on display here, but the Px8 is more expensive and not nearly as comfortable as the Px7 S3. Noble Audio FoKus Apollo While this is my top pick for overall sound quality in our main guide to the best wireless headphones , the ANC performance is less impressive than the Px7 S3. Bowers & Wilkins gets the nod here for its improved noise cancellation over the Px7 S2 and Px7 S2e, and its overall excellent audio quality. Noise-canceling headphones FAQs Does noise cancellation block all noise? Noise cancellation doesn’t block out all noise, though it does drastically reduce the volume of most external sounds. Is there a difference between wired vs wireless noise-canceling headphones? In terms of sound quality, if you have two headphones — one wired and one wireless — with similar specs, the difference is going to be very minimal. However, wireless headphones offer more convenience, allowing you to move around more freely with your headphones on, which is why they often feature noise cancellation to minimize external sounds. Does noise cancellation impact sound quality? ANC does bear some weight on sound quality, but the impact of this often doesn’t outweigh the benefits. Noise cancellation reduces ambient noise, allowing a greater focus on audio detail. For audiophiles, however, there may be a small difference in sound fidelity when ANC is turned on.

While the website shows a badly edited image of what appears to be a Revvl 7 Pro 5G phone, an Instagram ad seems to depict an iPhone 16 Pro Max, again with the company's branding overlaid. A third confusing image edit was posted on X earlier this week: That photo shows a Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra equipped with a case made by Spigen.

In Parsons' place, Justin Truman, a general manager on Destiny 2 and Bungie's chief development officer, is taking over as studio head. \"After more than two decades of helping build this incredible studio, establishing the Bungie Foundation and growing inspiring communities around our work, I have decided to pass the torch,\" Parsons shared in a statement on Bungie's website. \"Today marks the right time for a new beginning. The future of Bungie will be in the hands of a new generation of leaders, and I am thrilled to announce that Justin Truman will be stepping into leadership as Bungie's new studio head.\" Parsons oversaw Bungie during a consequential period in the studio's history. Bungie started publishing its own games under his leadership, ending a longterm publishing deal with Activision that helped get Destiny released. Parsons also played a role in the studio's $3.6 million acquisition by Sony, which placed Bungie at the center of plans to develop live-service games for the PlayStation — a move that hasn't really paid off so far. Bungie has faced notable difficulties since coming under Sony ownership. The studio's relative independence did nothing to spare it from having to lay off 220 employees in 2024. Developing Bungie's next game, Marathon, has also seemed like an uphill battle. The game was delayed indefinitely earlier this year following the discovery that the alpha version of Marathon used stolen art assets . Truman's new leadership role suggests Destiny 2 will remain a going concern for Bungie. It might also signal a new relationship with Sony and PlayStation Studios. During a recent earnings call, Sony CFO Lin Tao said Bungie would be less independent in the future, and eventually \"become part of PlayStation Studios,\" PC Gamer reports .

Questions about Chrome's fate have been swirling since the news that the Department of Justice would push for Google to sell the browser after the ruling that the company's search engine business constituted a monopoly. Although Google is planning to appeal the decision, that hasn't stopped other big tech businesses from pitching themselves as potential owners of Chrome. Ecosia's proposal is different. Rather than selling off the valuable browser for an upfront windfall, this plan would see Google transforming Chrome into a foundation. Ecosia would assume operational responsibility for the browser for ten years, but Google would retain the ownership and intellectual property rights. Under the arrangement, Ecosia would devote about 60 percent of Chrome's profits toward climate and environmental projects. It wouldn't pay a cent upfront for the stewardship role, but the remaining 40 percent of Chrome's profits would be given back to Google. Considering Ecosia is projecting Chrome to generate $1 trillion over the next decade, that's no small potatoes. On the surface, this idea is pretty far-out. However, going the stewardship route would deepen an existing relationship between Google and Ecosia. Google already powers the environmentally-focused benefit corporation's search engine, and the two parties have an established revenue-sharing agreement. Putting Chrome in the hands of a nonprofit rather than a for-profit rival may actually be a positive for Google, both financially and in public opinion.

Special Note Nitro 3.7.0 uses go-ethereum 1.15.11 and includes a brand new log indexing system called filtermaps that has resulted in an increase in log indexing latency due to Nitro’s current reliance on HashDB (instead of PathDB). In some cases, this can delay log queries from being served anywhere between 5 seconds to 2 minutes on Arbitrum One during long tail unindexing. We’ve observed that this happens roughly once per day based on Arbitrum One mainnet traffic levels. Teams who need to serve log queries with consisten latency (e.g. eth_getLogs , eth_getFilterLogs , eth_getFilterChanges ) can use the configuration parameter --execution.rpc.log-history=0 to keep all log history, which will only slightly increase database growth. Teams running their own log indexer may be unaffected. Future releases of Nitro are expected to fix the issue of log indexing being able to block log queries.

Two new features make it easier for Spotify's nearly 700 million users to share their favorite tunes. When sharing a Spotify track to Instagram Stories , a short snippet of the song will now be included. When people view the story, they'll have an option to open the track in Spotify. They can do that by tapping the music sticker on your post. Spotify Along similar lines, Instagram Notes now lets you show your friends what you're jamming out to. When creating a note, tap the music note symbol. Then, in the audio browser, choose \"Share from Spotify.\" The note will auto-update to show what you're listening to at that point. (Or, if you're not, it will display the next song you play within 30 minutes, so choose wisely.) Friends can tap your note to add the track to their Spotify likes. Inversely, Instagram integration is easier in the Spotify app. When sharing a currently playing track from there, a new Notes icon will appear next to other Instagram sharing options. The new features are available now (globally) on iOS and Android.

A big focus of Google's pitch for Gemini for Government is the idea of automating administrative tasks with AI agents. The company touts pre-built Deep Research and Idea Generation agents that will be available to government agencies from the jump, but anyone who invests in the new AI platform will also get the ability to build custom agents of their own. Gemini for Government will also offer threat protection and data privacy features, and will be compliant with cloud security standards like Sec4 and FedRAMP. Google's offering its AI platform for $0.50 per year for government agencies, with the option to pay more for extra security features. The low price is as much an enticement as it is a jab at OpenAI and Anthropic, who both announced $1 government AI deals in the last few months. These attempts to become government AI contractors are happening in the shadow of the AI Action Plan President Donald Trump announced in July. The Trump administration's stated goal is to spur development, turn AI into an American export and remove \"idealogical bias\" from AI models, but the specifics of the plan are concerningly open to interpretation. Trump's proposal asks federal agencies to withhold \"AI-related\" funding from states with \"burdensome\" AI regulations. It also directs the Federal Communications Commission to assume a role in regulating AI, placing even more theoretical power in the executive branch.

The OS 26es are coming with huge upgrades to your iPhone and iPad's operating systems. You've heard of Liquid Glass , right? It's like the better-executed version of Windows Vista and definitely one of the cooler features coming this fall. We spent two weeks test-driving it — you can check out our detailed hands-on iOS 26 preview , or you can try it out yourself by downloading and installing the public beta 4 . That software is a more stable iteration of the separate developer version, which recently hit the beta 7 waypoint, and offers a few more flashy features not yet available in the public version. (While the public beta is open to everyone and quite stable, always remember there's a degree of risk involved with beta software.) Additionally, there are credible reports that iOS 26 could bring a new live translation feature to AirPods , too. Not sure if you want to upgrade your smartphone or tablet this year? No worries, we'll help you find out if your devices will be able to run iOS 26. While Apple didn't nix any iPhones from its eligibility list last year, that's not the case for 2025 — a few models are getting cut this time. All iPhone 8 models and the iPhone X were the last to get the boot in 2023, and this year the 2018 models are getting left behind. If you have an ineligible device, you won't be able to download iOS 26 when it becomes available this fall. We'll get to the bottom of which iPhones and iPads will support iOS 26 and iPadOS 26 this year. To see what's coming with the latest OSes, check out everything announced at Apple's WWDC June 9 event . One thing you shouldn't immediately expect is Apple's updated version of Siri , though the company is reportedly working on a 'stripped-down' AI chatbot to compete with ChatGPT. These three iPhones won't be compatible with iOS 26 Unlike last year, several iPhone models won't be eligible to download the newest iOS when it makes its debut this fall. This trio of models first released in 2018 won't be coming to the iOS 26 party: iPhone XR iPhone XS iPhone XS Max iPhones compatible with iOS 26 While we don't yet know the new iPhones Apple will be dropping this fall — though there are iPhone 17 rumors — we do know, per Apple's site , that the phones listed below will be compatible with iOS 26. Basically, if you have an iPhone that was announced in 2019 or later, you're in the clear: iPhone SE (second generation or later) iPhone 11 iPhone 11 Pro iPhone 11 Pro Max iPhone 12 iPhone 12 mini iPhone 12 Pro iPhone 12 Pro Max iPhone 13 iPhone 13 mini iPhone 13 Pro iPhone 13 Pro Max iPhone 14 iPhone 14 Plus iPhone 14 Pro iPhone 14 Pro Max iPhone 15 iPhone 15 Plus iPhone 15 Pro iPhone 15 Pro Max iPhone 16 iPhone 16 Plus iPhone 16 Pro iPhone 16 Pro Max iPhone 16e iPads compatible with iPadOS 26 The iPads listed below, and any iPads released later this year, are eligible to download iPadOS 26 . iPad Pro (M4) iPad Pro 12.9‑inch (3rd generation and later) iPad Pro 11‑inch (1st generation and later) iPad Air (3rd generation and later, including M2 and M3) iPad (8th generation and later, including A16) iPad mini (5th generation and later, including A17 Pro) What if I don't want to buy a new iPhone? If you want to continue using your older iPhone that isn't supported by iOS 26, that's fine. However, you'll miss out on security updates which could potentially put your phone at risk for malware and other threats. Additionally, some apps may stop working if they require a certain version of iOS or later. And of course, you won't be able to access the latest features iOS 26 offers. When will iOS 26 become available? Apple usually rolls out its latest iOS in mid-September, just a few days before the new iPhones hit store shelves. Last year, it released iOS 18 on Monday, Sept. 16. Expect a confirmation of the release date at the iPhone 17 event, expected in early September. iOS 26 features we're excited about Liquid Glass design : Your home screen is getting revamped with new app icons, including dark mode and all-clear options. You'll also notice buttons with a new floating design. Liquid Glass was designed to make all of Apple's OSes more cohesive. Phone app redesign: You'll finally be able to scroll through contacts, recent calls and voicemail messages all on one screen. It also comes with a new feature called Hold Assist that'll notify you when an agent comes to the phone so you can avoid the elevator music. Live Translate: iOS 26 is bringing the ability to have a conversation via phone call or text message with someone who speaks another language. Live Translate will translate your conversation in real time. Polls feature: Coming to group messages in the Messages app, chat members will be able to create polls. This can help prevent the unwanted 30+ messages when it comes to deciding which restaurant you're meeting at this weekend.

Today, The New York Times reported on allegations that Blahnik created a toxic workplace environment, with his behaviors described as \"verbally abusive, manipulative and inappropriate.\" He and Apple are currently being sued by one former employee, and the company has already settled a separate complaint against Blahnik that accused him of sexual harassment. In addition, sources told the Times that about a tenth of Blahnik's reports have sought extended health or medical leave since 2022. Apple reportedly conducted an internal investigation into Blahnik but found no evidence of wrongdoing. Employees told the publication that they felt the company was more committed to protecting a notable executive than addressing workers' concerns. \"We strongly disagree with the premise of this story, and there are many inaccurate claims and mischaracterizations,\" Lance Lin, a spokesperson from Apple, told the Times in response to the paper's report.

(Google, Sam Rutherford/Engadget) Last month, the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 was released and immediately became the de facto king of the foldable phone hill. But now a new challenger has arrived: The Pixel 10 Pro Fold . The full details are now available in the wake of Google's splashy launch event , which debuted the Fold alongside the full new Pixel 10 line, a new Pixel smartwatch and two new earbuds, too (see everything Google announced ). But the Pixel 10 Pro Fold was the star of the show, and it's vying with the Z Fold 7 for the title of best foldable — both offer very similar designs, but each bringing something unique to the table. Samsung launched its first foldable phone in 2019, so it's had quite a bit of time to refine the Galaxy Fold over the years. Google on the other hand just released its first Pixel Fold a couple years ago — but has already largely evened the match . And, of course, with enhanced Gemini AI software integration front and center, you'll have access to Google's impressive artificial intelligence features at nearly every turn. We'll break down how the Pixel 10 Pro Fold and Galaxy Z Fold 7 stack up to one another. You can also check out our comparison of the Pixel 9 Pro Fold and the Galaxy Fold 6 to see how much has changed in a year. Price First things first, how much will one of these high-tech folding phones cost you? That is the make-or-break question, after all. The newest Pixel foldable is still less expensive than this year's Z Fold: it starts at $1,799 while the Galaxy smartphone starts at $2,000. You don't have any other real choices for \"book-style\" foldables in the US market. The OnePlus Open can be had for $1,499, but it's almost two years old. And Apple's most expensive phone is currently the $1,599 1TB iPhone 16 Pro Max — but as a non-foldable model with just a single screen, it's hardly a straight comparison. If the rumor mill is to be believed, Apple may finally bow a foldable iPhone in 2026 . Dimensions and display It's a race for the largest display and Samsung won this time — but not by much. The Galaxy Z Fold is just a hair bigger than the Pixel Pro Fold. Both phones' inner displays are 8 inches across when fully opened, while Samsung comes out ahead on the outer display with 6.5 inches (the Pixel is 6.4 inches). As for height, the new foldable Pixel phone is 6.1 inches and the Galaxy Z is 6.2 inches — not a huge difference there. When unfolded, the Samsung wins on size efficiency, packing the identically sized 8-inch internal display into an area that's 0.3 inches smaller — 5.6 inches versus the Pixel's 5.9. This year, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold’s displays have been upgraded to a Super Actua Flex OLED display with ultra-thin glass. Both the front screen and back cover come equipped with Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2. As for the Galaxy Z Fold 7, it has a Dynamic AMOLED display (inner and outer) and comes with the Corning Gorilla Glass Ceramic 2 on the front and the Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the backside. The glass is ultra-thin, yet it's 50 percent thicker than before. While slightly bigger, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is still lighter than the Pixel 10 Pro Fold. The Samsung model weighs only 7.6 ounces — down nearly an ounce from its 2024 model — while its Google competition comes in at 9.1 ounces (the same as last year's model). The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 (left) compared to the new Pixel 10 Pro Fold (right). (Sam Rutherford/Engadget) Processor, RAM, storage and battery The Pixel 10 Fold Pro runs the Tensor G5 chip — Google says its CPU features 34 percent better performance compared to the Tensor G4 chip. The Z Fold 7 is powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy. \"Everything feels fast and snappy,\" Engadget's Sam Rutherford said of the Snapdragon 8 Elite performance on the Z Fold 7. (Sam also has first impressions of the Pixel 10 Pro Fold , but speed tests will happen a bit later.) Both phones offer the choice of 256GB, 512GB or 1TB storage. On the RAM front, the Pixel Fold delivers 16GB across the line, while the Samsung model reserves that level for the top 1TB storage tier; the small models get 12GB instead. The Galaxy phone will cost you $2,419 if you decide you need the maximum amount of storage, whereas the Pixel Fold tops out at $2,149. When it comes to battery life, Samsung's foldable lasts up to 24 hours with a 4,400mAh battery. The Pixel lasts up to 30 hours thanks to a more capacious 5,015mAh battery rating. Furthermore, the Pixel Fold is certified for Qi2 wireless charging, which Google is branding as \" Pixelsnap \" across its 2025 Pixel line for the first time. Cameras For many shoppers, a phone is only as good as its cameras, and both of these phones bring a strong lens game. Each has three rear cameras, though they're different aesthetically. You'll notice the Pixel has a larger camera bump with two rows, while the Galaxy has a thinner vertical line of cameras. The Pixel 10 Pro Fold's rear camera array consists of a 48MP wide sensor, a 10.5MP ultrawide and a 10.8MP telephoto with 5x optical zoom. All three offer \"Super Res Zoom\" up to 20x with optical and electronic image stabilization. Per our own Sam Rutherford, the potential drawback here is that Google played it safe: \"The biggest potential shortcoming of the P10PF is that its camera hardware is largely staying the same. Granted, that's not a huge deal because the previous model had the best photo quality of any foldable phone.\" By comparison, the Samsung Galaxy Fold 7 rear camera trio includes the same 200MP wide-angle camera as the company's Galaxy S25 Ultra, but carries over the 12MP ultrawide and 10MP telephone from the Z Fold 6. Zoom levels are 3x optical and 30x digital. While we have yet to put the Pixel 10 Pro Fold cameras through their paces, Sam was still liking last year's Pixel Fold versus the Galaxy Z Fold 7 when he reviewed the latter: \"At night, the Fold 7's shots remained surprisingly sharp. I still prefer the Pixel 9 Pro Fold due to its more accurate white balance and often sharper focus, though Samsung's phone isn't far behind.\" And the entire Pixel line's cameras are (of course) supercharged with some new Google Gemini AI niceties, like the Camera Coach feature that enables voice-controlled photo editing. Both the Pixel and Galaxy offer similar 10MP specs on their front and inner selfie cameras. Color options If you like having multiple colors to choose from, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is winning in this category. It comes in Mint, Jetblack, Blue Shadow and Silver Shadow. Mint is only available if you buy your phone online — you won't be seeing that one in stores. As for the Pixel 10 Fold Pro, your options are Moonstone and Jade.

The road safety regulator says the probe involves inconsistencies with how the company reports crashes regarding the aforementioned systems. The NHTSA requires automakers to report crashes involving autonomous and driver assistance systems within five days of being notified of them. The agency claims that Tesla has sometimes waited months to report these crashes. It's worth remembering that the company's vehicles are outfitted with technology that automatically records and sends out data regarding a collision within minutes of an accident. Tesla has acknowledged the issue but says this is all due to an error in its systems, which has since been fixed. However, the agency will continue the investigation, citing that it will \"assess whether any reports of prior incidents remain outstanding and whether the reports that were submitted include all of the required and available data.\" The NHTSA has good reason to not accept Tesla's explanation at face value. It currently has other open investigations into the company. There's one involving its remote parking feature that has allegedly caused a number of crashes and another looking into the efficacy of a recent software fix that followed a massive recall . NHTSA Tesla also recently lost a wrongful death case involving an Autopilot crash in which it was revealed in testimony that the company lied and misled police and plaintiffs to hide pertinent data. The company leads other auto manufacturers by a country mile when it comes to crashes involving driver assistance systems . Tesla vehicles were involved in the vast majority of total incidents reported to the NHTSA from 2021 to 2024. That translates to over 2,300 crashes, compared to 55 for second-place GM .

On Thursday, developer GSC Gameworld gave us a specific release date: November 20. That's exactly a year after its PC and Xbox launch . The PS5 version will support adaptive triggers, haptic feedback, gyro aiming and more. Meanwhile, PS5 Pro users will see upgraded resolution, shadows and reflections (among other enhancements). The game will be available in a $60 standard edition, an $80 deluxe one and a $110 ultimate edition. GSC Gameworld The game had quite a development process: It lasted 14 years . (Amusingly, \" Stalker 2 sneaking up on a 2012 launch\" was our first headline about the game.) GSC Gameworld was plagued by funding issues, a near shutdown and a transition to a new game engine. Then, Russia threw another wrench in the Ukrainian studio's plans, with its 2022 invasion. Sadly, the company even lost a team member in the war. When the game finally launched in 2024, it still had plenty of bugs. However, the team has worked hard to patch those ever since. Hopefully, the PlayStation version will benefit from the extra clean-up time and offer a polished experience from day one. You can pre-order Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl today from the PlayStation Store .

AI Mode has previously only been available in the US, India and the UK, and while English remains the only supported language right now, Google says it’ll add more soon. Google is also expanding its AI Mode’s agentic capabilities, so you can now use natural language to find restaurant reservations. Google says you can ask about getting a dinner reservation with conditions such as group size, date, location and your preference of cuisine, all of which be taken into consideration when AI Mode pulls in its results from across the web. Suggestions will be presented in list form with the available reservation slots. It’ll also provide a link to the booking page you need. Google also plans to add local service appointments and event ticketing capabilities soon, with Ticketmaster and StubHub among its partners. AI Mode leverages Google’s web-browsing AI agent Project Mariner' its direct partners on Search and resources like Knowledge Graph and Google Maps when prompted to find you somewhere to eat. It has partnered with the likes of OpenTable, Resy and Tock to incorporate as many restaurants as possible and streamline the booking process. Right now, this feature is exclusive to those subscribed to the wildly expensive Google AI Ultra plan in the US, and can be accessed through its Labs platform. If you opt into the AI Mode experiment it can also remember your previous conversations and searches to give you results that more closely match your preferences. Finally, if your AI-powered conversations are simply too interesting to keep to yourself, Google will now let you bring others in when you tap the \"Share\" button on a response. This allows your chosen contact to join the conversation at that point and ask their own follow-up questions. Google uses planning trips or parties as examples of when you might want to collaborate with someone else on an AI-assisted task. The original sender can delete shared links whenever they like.

Just how much better is the new version of Lumo? Proton claims it offers a 170 percent improvement in context understanding, meaning the chatbot is able to more accurately answer questions based on documents and data users share with it. It's also 40 percent better at generating working code, and 200 percent better at working through multi-step problems, as well as using the right tools to tackle tricky prompts. Proton One area where the original release felt like it wasn't up to the level of the competition was when it came to providing answers about current events. Thanks to a better web search tool, Proton says Lumo 1.1 should provide more accurate answers while suffering from fewer hallucinations. Proton doesn't say how it measured those improvements, but the company did share a handful of screenshots that compare the responses generated by Lumo 1.1 and 1.0. If nothing else, the new chatbot does a better job of formatting its answers in a way that's easy to follow. As before, any conversations you have with Lumo are encrypted, with no logs shared with Proton or any other company. Proton is also releasing the code for Lumo's iOS and Android apps so the open source community can verify the company's security credentials.

This line of headphones is consistently impressive and the WH-1000XM is truly in a league of its own . So we get excited when one of the all-around best headphones out there goes on an aggressive sale. You can pick up a pair of XM5s right now for just $274, which is 32 percent off its normal retail price of $400. In our review of the XM5 we awarded a score of 95 out of 100, impressed with just about every aspect of the set with the notable exception of its price, which makes a sale like this all the more exciting. The XM5s are supremely comfortable, thanks to a slim cushioned headband and soft earcups. In our review, we had no problem wearing them for hours at a time and never felt uncomfortable pressure on the ears or head. 30mm carbon-fiber drivers deliver excellent audio, delivering a wide and immersive soundstage. The XM5 carries eight total microphones as part of its active noise-canceling system, up from four on the previous model , and delivers top-of-class ANC. The battery life on these headphones is best in class, with around 30 hours of listening per charge. Touch controls on the outside panel of the right ear cup help you control your music with ease, allowing you to play, pause, skip tracks and adjust the volume right from the headphones. The only real downside at this point is you’re buying a pair of headphones that are three years old; the XM6 offers some noteworthy improvements. But, of course, it’ll cost you. If you've been thinking about upgrading your headphones, or picking up your first pair of real high-quality cans, then take advantage of these savings. The sale price of $274 applies to the black model only, though the other colors are 18 percent off, selling for $328. Follow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice .

We must make sure that these inequalities are addressed for future generations. That’s why reviving the pensions commission – bringing together unions, employers and independent experts – is a vital step forward. We’re determined to close the gender pensions gap, and the new state pension has already reduced historic inequalities faced by women and low earners. Alongside this, the pensions commission will tackle barriers to close the gender pensions gap in private pensions to ensure women have the dignity and security they deserve in retirement.

The company announced that the Ambeo Soundbar Max , a $2,000 beast of a living room speaker, will gain two features it calls Customizable Immersion and Voice Enhancement Mode. Plus, the company is adding lossless audio support on top of Dolby Atmos Music. The firmware update will equip the Max with Ambeo OS2 and is available via free download through the Sennheiser Smart Control app for iOS and Android. With Customizable Immersion, Sennheiser will give users the ability to adjust volume levels for side, top and center channel virtualization. The company says this will allow customers to tailor the immersion to their preferences or to the content they're watching. As you might expect, Voice Enhancement Mode boosts dialogue to ensure it remains clear when sound effects or music would otherwise overpower the mix in movies, TV shows or during sports events. The Ambeo Soundbar Max already offered support for spatial audio for tunes via Dolby Atmos Music, but now the living room speaker will allow you to play lossless audio too. Sennheiser says you can expect up to 24-bit/96kHz through Google Cast and up to 24-bit/192kHz from Tidal Connect. The Ambeo Soundbar Max originally arrived in 2019 as the Ambeo Soundbar. Sennheiser changed the name when it expanded the Ambeo Soundbar lineup, which now includes the mid-sized Plus and compact Mini options. The Max was $2,500 at launch before rising to $3,000, but the company is now selling it's biggest home theater unit for $2,000. That may seem like a lot for one piece of your setup, but Sennheiser promises the combination of bass performance and Ambeo tech means you won't need a separate subwoofer or rear satellite speakers. Those claims held up during my review of the soundbar back when it debuted.

This is a great deal for those who own a Switch 2 and want to take advantage of the camera functionality in games like Mario Kart World and that recently-released campfire sim . This was designed specifically for Nintendo's new console, so it's a plug-and-play affair. It's actually cheaper than the official Switch 2 camera with this sale and it looks a whole lot cooler. It's a Piranha Plant from the Mario franchise. We called it a \"work of art\" upon encountering the device and that holds true today. This thing is not only stylish, resembling an Amiibo more than a camera, but it's downright useful. The pot the Piranha Plant sits in functions as both a stand and USB extension for the device. The plant itself detaches from the pot, so the camera can be used in portable mode by popping it into the USB port at the top of the console. There's also a built-in privacy shutter. Just close the plant's mouth to obscure the lens. The actual camera specs here aren't going to win any awards, with a frame rate of 30FPS and a resolution of 640 x 480p. However, that's more than enough to capture footage of your floating head to accompany your kart as it races through the Mushroom Kingdom.

This is just the latest update in the lengthy legal saga between Masimo and Apple, which started when the former sued the iPhonemaker in 2021, accusing it of infringing on several of its light-based blood oxygen monitoring patents. After a court sided with Masimo in 2023, Apple was forced to stop selling the Watch Series 9 and the Ultra 2 in the US for a few weeks. In order to circumvent the import ban for the devices, Apple removed the Blood Oxygen app for the watch models sold in the US. Just a few days ago, however, the company introduced a \"redesigned Blood Oxygen feature\" for the Watch Series 9, Series 10 and Watch Ultra 2 models. The feature works by measuring and calculating data from the watches' sensors on their paired iPhones instead. Users will then be able to view their blood oxygen data in the Respiratory section of the Health app. Apple said the update was \"enabled by a recent US Customs ruling.\" But Masimo said in its complaint (via Bloomberg Law ) that it only heard about the ruling, which was handed down on August 1, when Apple made the announcement. It argued that the agency typically requires both sides to be heard before making such decisions and that Customs \"exceeded its authority.\" Masimo is now asking the court to put an injunction on UCBP's decision and, ultimately, to only allow imports of the devices if their blood oxygen-tracking function is disabled. \"Each passing day that this unlawful ruling remains in effect irreparably deprives Masimo of its right to be free from unfair trade practices and to preserve its competitive standing in the US marketplace,\" Masimo said.

The Insta360 GO Ultra is being billed as a new, more powerful product line in the GO series, instead of a replacement for the GO 3S . This next generation represents a substantial step up in performance, powered by a new 5nm AI chip, which is a big jump from the 14nm chip found on the GO 3S. It also benefits from a larger 1/1.28-inch sensor, roughly twice the size of the one in the 3S. All of this unlocks better image quality with support for HDR, 4K capture at 60 fps and double the frame rate of the 3S. The Ultra also offers PureVideo, an enhancement that uses AI-powered algorithms to reduce noise and increase brightness in low-light captures. The form factor for the Ultra is largely the same as the 3S, with a compact camera body that can be optionally housed in an Action Pod that offers additional battery life and a 2.5-inch flip touchscreen for live camera view. The Ultra weighs 53 grams (around 1.9 ounces), 14 grams more than the 3S, and sports a square body, as opposed to the pill-like shape of the 3S. The slightly larger body means a 70-minute standalone battery life, which is just over 80 percent more than the 38 minutes on the 3S. The Action Pod extends this to 200 minutes. The Ultra also offers removable storage, expandable up to 2TB. Like most Insta360 cameras , much of the design is geared toward action shots for the more adventurous among us. The GO Ultra's IPX8 rating means it's waterproof down to 33 feet underwater. A magnetic clip system makes it easy to attach the GO Ultra to a piece of clothing or equipment and start capturing your adventure in 4K. The Insta360 GO Ultra is available now worldwide for $450.

The US, if you'll recall, blocked NVIDIA from selling its H20 chips to China back in April out of concern that the Chinese military would use them to develop AI technology. When the US government reversed its decision in July and allowed the company to start shipping its chips to China, Lutnick told CNBC : \"We don't sell them our best stuff, not our second best stuff, not even our third best. The fourth one down, we want to keep China using it... The idea is the Chinese are more than capable of building their own. You want to keep one step ahead of what they can build, so they keep buying our chips. You want to sell the Chinese enough that their developers get addicted to the American technology stack. That's the thinking.\" To note, a previous Times report stated that the government allowed NVIDIA to ship its products to China again after agreeing to hand over 15 percent of its profits. As a response to Lutnick's remarks, the Times says Chinese authorities sought ways to prevent local companies from buying H20 chips. CAC issued an informal notice instructing China's biggest tech firms, such as ByteDance and Alibaba, to stop new orders for H20 chips until the government is done conducting a national security review. The companies are compelled to comply, because they could face substantial fines from the CAC if they don't. Meanwhile, NDRC also issued an informal notice, asking local tech companies not to purchase any NVIDIA chip. Reuters recently reported that NVIDIA is developing a new chip for the Chinese market that's more powerful than the H20, perhaps driven in part by China's move to discourage its purchase. It will be based on the company's Blackwell architecture, but will only be capable of half the computing power of NVIDIA's Blackwell Ultra GPUs.

Some are better than others, and NordVPN sits squarely in the better category. Now, you can save up to 77 percent on most of NordVPN's plans. Arguably the best plan for most people is the NordVPN Plus plan , which you can get two years of access for only $108 right now. That's 73 percent off the usual rate, and NordVPN throws in an addition three months for free, so you're actually getting a 27-month subscription for the sale price. As well as Nord’s VPN service, a Plus plan also includes the Threat Protection Pro anti-malware tool, password management and an ad- and tracker-blocker. A Prime plan additionally comes with encrypted cloud storage or NordProtect, which insures you against identity theft and monitors dark web activity. That's also on sale — down to $189 on the same two-year commitment with those three additional months thrown in, which works out to a 77 percent savings on the regular price. When Engadget’s Sam Chapman reviewed NordVPN earlier this year, he praised its excellent download speeds, exclusive features and extensive server network. Less impressive is its clunky interface and inconsistent design when jumping between different platforms running a NordVPN app. While it doesn't quite make the cut in our guide to the best VPNs available right now, it generally performed well in speed tests and Threat Protection Pro is really worth having.

Companies like Netflix, Disney, Max and others have been consistently raising prices to the point where you may question if streaming is even worth it anymore . We at Engadget still think it is, but we also think you should be smart with your money — and that’s where streaming deals come in. Yes, it is possible to get discounts on services like Peacock and Paramount+, even if those deals aren’t as common as a sale on AirPods. If you’re looking to save money and still stream all of the content you want, Engadget can help by laying out the best streaming deals you can get right now, how you can save with bundles and everything you should know before paying for yet another streaming service. Best streaming deals True streaming deals can be hard to come by. Most often, they’ll pop up during the Black Friday shopping period. On occasion, we’ll see them sparingly throughout the year and they usually take the form of a discounted monthly or annual rate for a limited period of time. Also, true streaming deals are typically on the ad-supported versions of a service, but once in a while you’ll find a unicorn of a deal on a tier that has ad-free viewing. If you’re able to wait for a deal before subscribing to a streaming service, we recommend doing so. You’ll save money upfront and in the long run, and you also have the option to cancel your subscription before the price goes back up to the normal rate. Maybe you find you like the service so much that you’re fine paying full price for it — that’s the ideal situation. But if you’re not compelled to keep that app on rotation in your smart TV, most streaming services make it easy for you to cancel at any time. With that said, these are the best streaming deals you can snag right now. DirecTV starting at $50/month for one month ($35 off): All of DirecTV's signature packages are $35 off right now for your first month when you sign up. If you opt for the base \"Entertainment\" package, you'll spend $50 for the first month and get access to over 90 channels, including many local stations as well as ESPN, ESPN 2 and Fox Sports 1. You'll also be able to watch on the go with the DirecTV mobile app. DashPass Annual + HBO Max (with ads) for $96/year ($144 off): This offer includes access to HBO Max with ads for no extra cost when you sign up for a DashPass Annual plan. You can then decide to upgrade to Max Standard, which removes ads, for a discounted rate of $11 monthly if you want. Aside from the obvious streaming benefits, this deal gives you $0 deliver fees and lower service fees on some restaurant DoorDash orders, five percent DoorDash credits on pickup orders, on-demand grocery delivery and other members-only exclusives. Spotify Premium Individual (3 month) for $0 ($36 off): This is our favorite music streaming service for podcasts and social features. Right now, users who have not signed up for Spotify's Premium service before are eligible to get three months for free. The Premium Individual plan lets you listen ad-free and skip songs at will. You can also organize your listening queue and download content for offline listening. Just be aware, your subscription will auto-renew at the end of the trial period. So if you don't want to be on the hook for the $12 monthly fee, set a reminder to cancel and go back to the free version. Fubo Pro for $55/month for the first month ($30 off): Fubo has introductory discounts on most of its packages, and the Pro package is the least expensive plan currently listed. It offers access to 224 channels, unlimited cloud DVR and up to 10 simultaneous streams. It even includes regional sports content from the NHL, MLB and NBA. YouTube TV (three months) for $150 ($99 off) : You can get three months of our favorite live TV streaming service for $50 per month. That should give you a decent chunk of time to see if the service is right for you while saving some cash. The discount and trial are only open to new subscribers to YouTube TV’s base plan, which includes access to over 100 channels, unlimited DVR space and six household accounts with the ability to stream on three devices at once. Sling Orange for $23/month for the first month (50 percent off): New customers can get Sling Orange or Sling Blue for half off the usual price for the first month, bringing the final prices to $23/month and $25.50/month, respectively. Orange is likely best for sports fans, with eight exclusive sports and family channels, while Blue includes 19 exclusive news and entertainment channels. You can get both Orange and Blue access also for half off for one month, or $33 total. Peacock first responders discount — one year for $48 (50 percent off) : Medical professionals and first responders can save 50 percent each year of Peacock. The deal requires annual verification and is open to those who work for either private or public institutions. Peacock has some great stuff to watch, including Poker Face and Killing It and more . Student discounts on streaming services HBO Max student discount — subscribe for $5/month (50 percent off): HBO Max offers their ad-supported tier to students for half off the usual rate. You’ll just have to verify that you’re a student through Unidays , and make note that this offer is only good for up to 12 months of service. Hulu student discount — subscribe for $2/month (75 percent off): Those with a valid student ID can get Hulu’s ad-supported tier for 75 percent off the typical rate. They’ll keep the same sale price for as long as they’re a student as well. Spotify student discount — Premium + Hulu with ads for $6/month (72 percent off): Spotify’s student offer continues to be one of the best around, giving you access to the Premium tier of the music streamer and Hulu’s ad-supported plan for only $6 monthly. Purchased separately, you’d pay $22 per month for both of the services. Plus, the first month is free when you sign up. NBA League Pass student discount — one year for $120 (40 percent off) : Students can get one year of League Pass for only $10 per month, which includes access to NBA TV and the ability to watch classic and archive games on-demand. On the NBA League Pass website, look for the student discount banner at the top and follow the instructions to verify your student status. Streaming bundle discounts There’s more consolidation happening now than ever before in the streaming space, and that means there are more streaming bundle options. These bundles offer you access to more content with one subscription price, but those prices are typically higher than paying for a single service by itself (obviously). It may be tempting to just get the bundle, but if only one of those services in the bundle speaks to you, you’ll spend less overall by just paying for the single service. Speaking of a deep love for a single streaming service: if all of your favorite shows are on Peacock or the latest releases on HBO Max consistently bring you joy, consider paying for one year upfront. Subscribing with an annual plan usually saves you money in the long term over paying on a monthly basis. Unfortunately, not all streaming services (looking at you, Netflix) have an annual subscription option. Here are some of the best streaming bundles you can get right now. Disney+, Hulu, HBO Max bundle with ads for $17/month : Ad-supported HBO Max is included here, along with full, ad-supported access to Disney+ and Hulu. You’ll save 43 percent with this bundle, as opposed to paying for all three services individually. Disney+ and Hulu Bundle Premium for $20/month : Disney and Hulu offer a few different bundles, which you can view in the drop-down lists under Choose Your Plan. This bundle removes the ads from both Disney+ and Hulu (with the exception of select live and linear content) and allows you to download content for offline viewing. You’ll save 42 percent with this bundle, as opposed to paying for both ad-free tiers individually. Hulu + Live TV with Disney+ and ESPN+ for $96/month: This streaming bundle amalgamation is a bit confusing but it does offer a lot: you get live TV streaming via Hulu’s service plus access to the following VOD services: Hulu, Disney+ and ESPN+. Out of those three, only ESPN+ will have ads. Disney+, Hulu, ESPN+ Bundle Basic for $17/month : You get full access to Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ content with this package, albeit with ads across the board. This bundle price is 46 percent off the total price of all three separate subscriptions. Disney+, Hulu, ESPN+ Bundle Premium for $27/month : Similarly to the Duo bundles, the Premium version of the Trio removes ads from most content in Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+, and you can download content for offline viewing. This price represents a 43-percent savings when compared to paying for all three ad-free tiers separately. Sling TV + HBO Max starting at $53/month: Sling TV and HBO Max have partnered on a discount that gives new subscribers 50 percent off their first month of Sling TV, plus $5 off monthly when you subscribe to the Sling TV + HBO Max bundle. The standard price for the Sling Blue + HBO Max duo is roughly $58/month, so you'll get a monthly discount of $5 off that. In addition, for the first month only, you'll get half off the price of the bundle. The promotion also applies to the Sling Orange & Blue + HBO Max package, which has a standard price of $73/month. Paramount+ with Showtime for $13/month or $120/year : This includes everything in Paramount+’s Essential plan, except the ads, and also provides access to Showtime content, live CBS streams and download features.

The latest company to sign with the SpaceX affiliate is Alaska Air Group, which announced that it will start offering Starlink Wi-Fi next year and expand the service to its entire fleet by 2027. \"With Starlink already live on [Alaska Air Group subsidiary] Hawaiian Airlines, we're proud that we'll offer... gate-to-gate connectivity on nearly every aircraft across both airlines,\" CEO Ben Minicucci said in a statement. The company noted in a separate announcement that it will offer the perk for free to members of its new loyalty program called Atmos Rewards . T-Mobile, a partner with Alaska, will also offer a \"seamless, ad-free Wi-Fi log-on\" to the in-flight Starlink service, with more details to be announced later this year. Alaska Air touted the benefits of \"ultra-fast speeds... up to 7x faster than the geostationary satellite-based Wi-Fi systems that most airlines use today.\" Other airlines may jump on board soon, too. British Airways is also on the verge of announcing a Starlink deal, Bloomberg reported, and SpaceX has also reportedly been in conversation with Dubai's Emirates. Both of those are flagship carriers in their respective nations, so winning the business would be a large coup for Starlink against legacy operators like Viasat and Echostar. Switching to Starlink isn't necessarily cheap, though. It reportedly costs around $300,000 to equip a 737 and around half a million to install the system on a 787 Dreamliner. On top of that, airlines pay around $120 monthly per seat, plus another $120 for live TV, according to Bloomberg 's sources. (None of the airlines in negotiations have confirmed any details.) Despite those costs, carriers see reliable in-flight internet as a potential game-changer, as it would allow customers to work, communicate and stream videos or live TV. If the latter can be done reliably, it might even allow airlines to get rid of heavy and expensive on-demand entertainment systems. The main downside for potential customers is SpaceX's owner, Elon Musk. Some may view his fractured relationship with US president Donald Trump as a negative, while end-users may be turned off by his political affiliations — something that has seemingly affected sales of his Tesla EVs of late.

The wide range of skills or life lessons you could learn through these classes is why MasterClass is on our list of best subscriptions you can give as gifts . Maybe your loved one who loves to host dinner parties could use some tips from Gordon Ramsay. There are three subscription tiers for MasterClass that each differ only in how many devices they allow at one time, and whether offline videos are supported. The Standard subscription only supports one device, whereas the Plus subscription allows two. These are normally $10 and $15 per month, respectively, and neither offers offline mode. The Premium tier, which carries a regular price of $20 per month, allows up to six devices and features offline mode for downloaded classes. All three tiers are part of the 50 percent off sale, which marks them down to $5, $8 and $10 respectively.

Overview This release includes a major reworking of the batcher-sequencer DA throttling feature (allowing for smoother control of transaction and block size limits), a new admin RPC method to flush the batcher (causing it to submit a transaction as soon as possible) as well as several performance enhancements and bugfixes. Sequencer throttling changes Warning This release changes the default throttling behavior. Chain operators should examine the new throttling documentation closely to ensure their batchers are configured appropriately for their chain. We deem the new defaults well suited for average OP Stack chains that use the default block gas limits and EIP1559 elasticity. Especially if you operate a high-throughput chain, you may want to change the throttling parameters, like the block-size-upper-limit and block-size-lower-limit . The old batcher supported only a very simple form of throttling: once a threshold of DA backlog was reached, it would fully throttle the sequencer and other block builders. This would often lead to a clunky user experience, as throttling kicks in fully at once, and then eases fully once the backlog dips below the threshold. This release introduces three new throttling controllers to allow for more smooth throttling behavior than this step controller . The three new controllers are linear , quadratic , and a PID-like controller (experimental, not recommended). The new default throttling controller is quadratic . Instead of throttling getting activated at a single threshold, like the old step controller, there is now a lower and upper threshold at which throttling starts and then continually increases in intensity as the backlog grows. The intensity curve is determined by the throttling controller (linear, quadratic, step (old behavior), PID (experimental)). Throttling at the lower threshold is weak and at the higher threshold strong. Please review the defaults by running ./op-batcher --help . Another important change is that the throttling threshold now takes all pending data into account, that is, all channels that are currently being submitted, the pending open channel that is currently being built, and the pending blocks that still need to be added to the pending channel. Before, throttling only took into account the pending blocks, which means that it may have triggered much too late if a high --max-pending-tx value was set (default: 1), which is common among high-throughput chain operators. Please read the new throttling documentation carefully to understand the new behavior and how to tweak it, if necessary.

Historically, the company uses those events to announce new iPhones, AirPods and Apple Watches — MacBooks tend to get their own, separate shindig (though we do expect the new macOS 26 software to come out around that time). For now, the most recent MacBooks are the M4 MacBook Air and the M4 MacBook Pro. Deciding between just two models may seem easy, but there are still plenty of variables to consider before you add one to your cart — screen size, chip capabilities, price and memory configurations will all come into play. We’ve reviewed every MacBook model to come out in the last 17 years or so , so we compiled this guide to help you pick the best MacBook for you. Table of contents Best MacBooks for 2025 What about budget MacBooks? Factors to consider when buying a MacBook MacBooks specs comparison chart Best MacBook FAQs Best MacBooks for 2025 What about budget MacBooks? Historically, Apple kept the previous year’s MacBook Air in its lineup as a sort of budget option. But the company took a different approach with the release of the M4 MacBook Air. Instead of continuing to sell the older model, Apple discontinued the M3 Air and gave its newest computer a $100 price cut. Now, if you can even find a brand new M3 MacBook Air (typically from retailers like Amazon or B&H), it’s often more expensive than the M4 version. During sales like Amazon Prime Day, we’ve seen the newest M4 Air go for as little as $799. That effectively makes our overall pick a budget pick as well. Of course, $800 isn’t exactly a small investment either for college students or others on a budget. Especially when you can find some decent PCs for under $500 . If you’re looking to save even more on a MacBook, we recommend checking out refurbished options directly from Apple , or even third party sellers like BackMarket. There are a few guidelines to keep in mind, which we go over in our refurbished guide , but mainly, you’ll want to shop from a reputable source that has a stated process and offers at least a year-long warranty. Using your old gear as a trade-in will bring down your final cost as well. Factors to consider when buying a MacBook Compared to PCs, Apple computers tend to have more streamlined specifications. The company has long been known for this simplicity, and the M-series “system-on-a-chip” condenses things even further. Prior to the M1 chip, Apple used Intel chips in its laptop and desktop computers. The M2 and M3 generations followed that first chip and currently sells MacBooks equipped with M4-series chips. You’ll find the standard M4 processor in the Air and the base-model Pro and the upgraded M4 Max and M4 Pro chips as options for the MacBook Pro (currently there is no M4 Ultra chip, as there was with the M3 series in the Mac Studio). All M-series chips combine, among other technologies, the CPU, graphics card and unified memory (RAM). Apple’s Neural Engine is included too, which is a specialized group of processor cores that handles machine learning tasks such as image analysis and voice recognition. While a unified chip means you have fewer decisions to make when picking a MacBook, there are still a few factors to consider, including specs like the number of CPU cores, amount of RAM, storage capacity, screen size, and, obviously, price. The finish color may be a minor consideration, but it's worth pointing out that the Pro comes in just two colors (Silver or Space Black) but the Air comes in four hues (Midnight, Starlight, Sky Blue and Silver). CPU cores The lowest-specced chip in a current-lineup MacBook is the standard M4 chip, which is found in all models of the MacBook Air and the base model MacBook Pro 14-inch. That chip houses a 10-core CPU and either an 8- or 10-core GPU. In total, there are three versions of the M4 chip: standard M4, M4 Pro and M4 Max (which are each a step up from their predecessors, the M3, M3 Pro and M3 Max chips). The burliest chip, the M4 Max is built with either a 14- or 16-core CPU and a 32- or 40-core GPU. Cores are, in essence, smaller processing units that can handle different tasks simultaneously. Having more of them translates to the computer being able to run multiple programs and applications at once, while also smoothly processing demanding tasks like video and photo editing and high-level gaming. In short, more cores allow for more advanced computing and better performance. But if your processing power needs fall below professional-level gaming and cinematic video and audio editing, getting the highest number of cores is likely overkill — and after all, more cores equals higher cost and more power usage. Photo by Devindra Hardawar/Engadget RAM Your options for RAM, or in Apple’s terminology, unified memory, varies, but with the switch to the M4 chip in all laptops, the lowest amount of RAM you can get is now 16GB. That’s a necessary spec-bump to accommodate the tech world’s favorite feature of the moment: AI or, in this case, Apple Intelligence (still AI, but Cupertino’s version). The M4 Pro chip has 24 or 48GB memory options, while the M4 Max chip supports 48, 64 or a whopping 128GB of RAM. You’ve likely heard the analogy comparing memory to the amount of workspace available on a literal desktop surface, whereas storage is the amount of drawers you have to store projects to work on later. The larger the worktop surface, the more projects you can work on at once. The bigger the drawers, the more you can save for later. In addition to supporting Apple Intelligence, more RAM is ideal for people who plan to work in multiple apps at once. And the more demanding each program is, the more RAM will be required. Extra memory can also come in handy if you’re the type who likes to have infinite numbers of tabs open on your browser. If your daily workflow doesn’t involve simultaneously using a vast number of memory-intensive programs, you can save yourself money and buy the RAM configuration that you’re most likely to actually use. For a long time, Apple continued to offer MacBooks with just 8GB of RAM, and we recommended upgrading to at least 16GB of RAM. With this being the standard today, grabbing a base model should be fine for most non-pro-level users. One thing to note is that, unlike most PCs, the RAM in a MacBook is not user-upgradable since it’s tied into the system-on-a-chip. If you think you might end up needing more memory, you should go for the spec upgrade up front. Storage capacity (SSD) Storage options range from 256GB of SSD for the base-model MacBook Air and 8TB of storage for the MacBook Pros with the M4 Max chip. If you want to rotate between a long roster of game titles or keep lots of high-res videos on hand, you’ll want more storage. If you’re mostly working with browser- and cloud-based applications, you can get away with a smaller-capacity configuration. That said, we recommend springing for 512GB of storage or more, if it’s within your budget. You’ll quickly feel the limits of a 256GB machine as it ages since the operating system alone takes up a good portion of that space. Having 1TB will feel even roomier and allow for more data storage over the life of your laptop. When Apple announced the iPhone 15 , the company also announced new iCloud+ storage storage plans , with subscriptions that allow up to 12TB of storage shared among your iOS and MacOS devices. You could also transfer files to an external storage device. But if you don’t want to pay for a monthly subscription and prefer the convenience of having immediate access to your files, it’s best to get the highest amount of storage space your budget allows for at the outset. Screen size The MacBook Air comes in 13- or 15-inch sizes. Pro models have either 14- or 16-inch screens. A two-inch delta may not seem like much but, as Engadget’s Nathan Ingraham noted when he reviewed the then-new 15-inch M2-powered MacBook Air, a larger screen \"makes a surprising difference.” That’s especially true if you plan to use your laptop as an all-day productivity machine and won’t be using an external monitor. More space means you can more clearly view side-by-side windows and have a more immersive experience when watching shows or gaming. But screen size is one of the main factors influencing weight. The 13-inch MacBook Air M4 weighs 2.7 pounds, whereas the top-end 16-inch MacBook Pro with the Max chip weighs 4.7 pounds. If you plan to travel a lot or swap your work locations regularly, a smaller screen will make life easier in the long run. All MacBooks feature IPS LCD panels ( in-plane switching , liquid crystal display), which Apple markets as Retina displays. The MacBook Air M4 has a Liquid Retina display and the Pro models have Liquid Retina XDR displays. “Liquid” refers to the way the lighted portion of the display “flows” within the contours of the screen, filling the rounded corners and curving around the camera notch. “XDR” is what Apple calls HDR (high dynamic range). You also get the option of a standard or nano-texture display on the MacBook Pro. The glass, which reduces glare and is also available on the Studio Display, iMac and iPad Pro, comes with a $150 price increase, but if you really don’t like reflections on your screen, it could be worth it. Compared to most other laptops, MacBook displays are notably bright, sharp and lush. But one feature worth pointing out is another Apple marketing term: ProMotion. It’s the company’s term to describe a screen with a higher, 120Hz refresh rate, which results in smoother scrolling and more fluid-looking graphics. Only MacBook Pros offer ProMotion; the Air maxes out at 60Hz, which is perfectly fine for everyday browsing and typical workdays. But if you want buttery-smooth motion from your display, you’ll have to shell out more money for an upgrade. Operating systems Software considerations won’t make much of a difference when deciding between MacBook models — all come with macOS installed. But if you’re switching from, say, a Windows PC, the operating system may be something to factor into your decision — though it’s probably less of an issue than it once was. Now that so much of the work we do on our computers is browser- and cloud-based, the learning curve between the two platforms isn’t as steep. Apps and programs like Gmail perform similarly regardless of what computer you’re using. Apple machines have historically had more limited support of AAA gaming titles, but even that is changing with more AAA games and better graphics coming to Macs. As for macOS, it’s getting better too. With macOS Tahoe 26 , the Spotlight function is more advanced, making it easier to find apps and perform tasks straight from your keyboard. The software also implements Apple's unifying Liquid Glass design for a modern look that looks consistent across iOS and iPad devices. New enhanced iPhone continuity features also make MacBooks and the handset work better together. A revamped Shortcuts app is more powerful as well, giving users custom automations that leverage Apple Intelligence (the company’s own AI). Price When Apple announced the MacBook Air M4, it also delivered a bit of refreshing news: The latest model now starts $100 cheaper than the previous generation. So now, the least expensive MacBook is the 13-inch, M4-powered Air with 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage for $999. Alternatively, you can spend up to $7,349 for the 16-inch MacBook Pro M4 Max with the nano-texture glass, 128GB of RAM and 8TB of storage. Chip type, screen size, memory and storage capacity all influence the final price, which is why guides like this can help you determine just what you need (and what you don’t) so you can get the most cost-effective machine for you. AppleCare is another cost to consider. The extended warranty plan from Apple covers repairs from accidents and offers free battery replacement and starts at $3.50 per month or $35 per year for MacBooks. We recommend the MacBook Air M4 for most people, and thanks to that $100 price cut, it’s also a good budget option. If you want something even cheaper, we recommend looking at refurbished M-series models from Apple. We think the 14- or 16-inch MacBook Pros are best for professionals. If you have extra money to spare once you’ve picked your machine, we recommend upgrading to at least 512GB of storage to make your machine as future-proof as possible. Of course, if you're just after the M4 chip and want the cheapest route to get it, you might consider the M4 Mac mini , which starts at $599 (though you'll have to supply the screen, mouse and keyboard).

Both the MacBook Air and Pro models come with the M4 chip. MBP models have the option of more powerful M4 Pro or M4 Max chips. The Pro has a higher resolution screen with a higher peak brightness that supports up to 120Hz adaptive refresh rates and XDR (extreme dynamic range). The battery life on most Pro models is longer than on the Air models as well. Pro models also have more ports and more speakers. In short, the MacBook Air is aimed at everyday users looking for good productivity and entertainment capabilities, while Pro models are aimed at professionals who need a high-performance computer. What's the difference between macOS and Windows? MacOS is the operating system developed by Apple and used in all of its desktop and laptop computers. It can only be found in hardware made by Apple including MacBooks and iMacs. Microsoft’s Windows operating system can be found in the company’s own Surface laptops as well as computers made by a wide array of manufacturers, like Acer, Asus, Dell and Razer.

Among those who remain, there is an eternal, quintessentially Parisian quest: hunting for a balmy terrasse bathed in sunlight for an evening apéritif.

We must make sure that these inequalities are addressed for future generations. That’s why reviving the pensions commission – bringing together unions, employers and independent experts – is a vital step forward. We’re determined to close the gender pensions gap, and the new state pension has already reduced historic inequalities faced by women and low earners.

The letter comes one week after an Israeli strike killed a group of Palestinian journalists in the besieged territory. Israeli defence minister Israel Katz’s order to send more troops into Gaza City came despite international criticism of the offensive , with fears of significant casualties and more mass displacement amid widening conditions of starvation in the territory. The situation in Gaza City was “catastrophic” and “large numbers” were fleeing eastern neighbourhoods , according to the Gaza municipality’s emergency committee chief, Mustafa Qazzaat. Resident Anis Daloul, 64, told the AFP news agency the Israeli military had “destroyed most of the buildings in Zeitoun and displaced thousands of people”. The additional Israeli reserve soldiers would not report for duty until September, a military official said on Wednesday, giving mediators time to bridge gaps between Hamas and Israel over the terms of any ceasefire and hostage deal. Hamas said Israel’s plans to conquer Gaza City showed its “blatant disregard” for efforts to broker a truce . The Israeli talk of a large-scale operation could primarily be intended to put pressure on the militant group in ceasefire talks, reports Peter Beaumont . More than 62,000 Palestinians have been killed in the Israeli war in Gaza since Hamas’s deadly attacks in October 2023, according to Gaza health officials. British UK foreign secretary David Lammy condemned Israel’s approval of the new settlement block in the West Bank as a “flagrant breach of international law”. The plan would split the West Bank into two with the intention – Israeli far-right minister Bezalel Smotrich has said – of ending any prospect of a Palestinian state. The Israeli military said on Thursday it has received a report about a security incident near the settlement of Malachei HaShalom in the West Bank , adding that details were under review.

During that event, we'll finally get to put our eyes on the iPhone 17 lineup. The latest iOS 26 features will come preinstalled on the new models, as well as any additional features Apple reveals at the launch event. But since we still have to wait a few weeks (presumably) until the iPhone event, we can at least speculate what the new phones will look like. As with most unreleased iPhone models, rumors and leaks have trickled in about the hardware side ahead of the official introduction. Here's what we're expecting and what we can reasonably assume we'll get from Cupertino in September. What are the latest iPhone 17 rumors? Could new \"TechWoven\" cases be introduced with the latest iPhone 17 lineup? That's what leaker Majin Bu claims , per a MacRumors report . The cases match the rumored design on the iPhone 17 models, with the wide camera bump. MacRumors says this could be a revamped version of the much-maligned FineWoven case, which was discontinued due to being susceptible to scratches and stains. Here are the new TechWoven Cases for iPhone 17 Full Article: https://t.co/UGMdYQWPJX pic.twitter.com/BftqiD03jO — Majin Bu (@MajinBuOfficial) August 20, 2025 The leaker noted there are two lanyard holes for \"convenient and secure carrying,\" so it could be worn around your neck. This is just a rumor and we won't know what the actual iPhone 17 models or accessories will look like until Apple's iPhone event next month. That said, the shared photos (including the one embedded above) are more convincing than usual. How much will the iPhone 17 cost? Apple's announced plan to expand US-based manufacturing partners seems to give it at least some shielding from the steepest Trump administration tariffs that have already triggered price increases on everything from Switch consoles to high-end cameras to Sonos speakers . But given that President Trump's trade policies can change from week to week, and Apple's continuing reliance on Asia-based supply chains, price shocks remain an ongoing possibility. The bigger question is: Will Apple absorb any higher costs, or pass them on to consumers? If prices do creep up, Apple may choose to pair it with an \"upgrade.\" Consider this recent rumor posted by MacRumors from a leaker known as \" Instant Digital ,\" suggesting that the default storage of the iPhone 17 line may start at 256GB, doubling the current 128GB baseline. While that could be accompanied by a price increase of $50 , Apple could at least pitch it as a \"better value.\" That said, the company doubled the default RAM of its Mac computers from 8GB to 16GB at no extra cost in 2024 — but that was before the current Trump tariff cycle started. When will the iPhone 17 series be announced? Most years, the flagship smartphones are introduced in September. MacRumors highlighted a story originally reported by iphone-ticker.de that the Apple iPhone 17 event could be Tuesday, September 9, according to information gleaned from German mobile phone providers. It's still too early to have the specific dates; some years, Apple only gives a week or two of lead time between sending invites and hosting the event. But years of past precedent show that sometime in September should be when the 17 models make their debut. This family of smartphones may be the last to follow that trend, however. There have been hints that the introduction of the iPhone 18 collection in 2026 will be split into a pro-tier announcement in the fall and a standard model announcement the following spring. What will the new iPhone 17 lineup include? Design leaks suggest that Apple is building an ultra-thin smartphone , likely to be named the iPhone 17 Air to match Apple's ultralight laptop designation. Bloomberg 's Mark Gurman, often a solid source of advanced intel about Apple, reported in January that the iPhone 17 Air will be equipped with a basic A19 chip and will only have a single camera lens. It may also use Apple's new in-house modem, which was introduced in February on the iPhone 16e . More details about this development may leak ahead of September, but that's what we know for now. An investor note from Apple analyst Jeff Pu indicated that the Air will have a titanium frame. If his reports are accurate, the lightweight smartphone will be the only entry in the iPhone 17 lineup to use that metal; the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max are expected to be made of aluminum, which is oddly a lighter material than titanium. Other speculation had suggested that the Air would use a blend of aluminum and titanium, so the exact materials may not be known until the official announcement. Additionally, an August 4 MacRumors report says the internal battery pack of the iPhone Air is just 2.49mm thick — half the thickness of the iPhone 17 Pro battery. The leak was posted on the Korean-language Naver blog , where they show the alleged batteries of the iPhone 17 Air and 17 Pro side by side. The same account claimed the 17 Air's battery capacity was a mere 2,800 mAh, MacRumors notes. (That's below the battery capacity of current iPhone 16 models.) On a similar topic, an iPhone 17 Pro production leak appears to have revealed an all-aluminum chassis, according to MacRumors . Originally posted by leaker Majin Bu , the image shows a shell that has a large round hole on the back (where the Apple logo typically is) to allow for MagSafe charging. MacRumors says this could just be a molding but notes that the aluminum frame (versus the current titanium in Pro iPhone models) would yield a significantly lower weight. That same leaker (Majin Bu), whom MacRumors classifies as a \"hit-or-miss leaker,\" suggests the iPhone 17 Pro will have better wireless signal strength thanks to an updated antenna design. The individual posted a render on X that shows a new antenna system that wraps around the iPhone 17 Pro's supposedly wider rear camera bump. Again, this is a render, not a real-world photo. That said, we can't knock the goal of better wireless reception, so we're hoping this one has a degree of truth to it. Each new roster includes a base model, but over the years, Apple has shaken up the variety of phones it offers. Most likely there will be an iPhone 17 and an iPhone 17 Pro. Apple has also committed to the size matters philosophy, and has been building an iPhone Pro Max option with an even bigger screen and better battery life; the 17 roster will almost certainly have one as well. The new Pro iPhones are said to have a full-width \"camera island\" on the rear, which would mark the first time an Apple model opted for that design. This feature can be seen in the purported iPhone 17 \"spotted in the wild.\" The pics, highlighted on MacRumors , show a black cased iPhone (17 Pro?) with the distinct back panel. Is it the real deal? The dual angles lend a degree of credibility in a social media landscape increasingly polluted with AI-enhanced fakes, but your guess is as good as ours. I just spotted a test development iPhone in the wild 🤩🤩🤩 pic.twitter.com/iS3PtKWqxJ — Fox Pupy 🦊🧡 (@Skyfops) July 28, 2025 The iPhone 17 Air seems primed to take the place of a potential iPhone 17 Plus. Since the iPhone 16e was only just introduced in February at a surprisingly high price point , it seems unlikely that there will be a new addition to that lower end of the spectrum, the models that were previously called SE. At the very least, it sounds like the iPhone 17 Air won't take away the charging port and rely only on wireless connectivity. Bloomberg said that while Apple had investigated making the iPhone 17 Air without a single port, the company (fortunately) changed plans. He also says that the rumored phone will have a 6.6-inch screen and include the Dynamic Island and Camera Control button. Finally, the price is rumored at $900 — likely more than the standard iPhone 17 but less than the Pro. We've also gotten what seems to be a reliable look at what the color lineup will be for the new smartphones. Macworld reported that the iPhone 17 will be available in black, white, steel gray, green, purple and light blue. The iPhone 17 Air will reportedly have four color options: black, white, light blue and light gold. While the Air colors will be less saturated, the visuals for the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max will go bold. The options for the Pro models are expected to be black, white, gray, dark blue and orange. On July 30, Tom's Guide highlighted an X post from Sonny Dickson — a longtime and generally reliable leaker of unreleased iPhone information — showing \"dummy\" iPhone 17 models in the new colors that were the source of the aforementioned Macworld story. While these are literally just mock-ups — not real, leaked iPhones — it's interesting to see how the design and color rumors translate into a real-world look and feel. To add the the rumors, a Weibo leaker known as Digital Chat Station suggests the iPhone 17e will come equipped with a new design that includes the Dynamic Island, MacRumors reports . According to the post, the new phone will have the A19 chip and could have a 6.1-inch OLED display with a front-facing 12-megapixel camera and a rear-facing 48-megapixel camera. However, it's important to note this report refers to the 17e model that would be expected to launch no earlier than February 2026, if it followed the same release pattern as the iPhone 16e . What will iOS 26 be like? Apple upended its numbering conventions with WWDC 2025, and will match the name of each new operating system to the year it's released. So when the next wave of iPhones hits, they'll be running on iOS 26 . On the design side, the smartphone OS introduced during the big developer showcase took a contentious approach dubbed Liquid Glass. Apple has been scaling down the amount of transparency effects in the subsequent beta tests of iOS 26, but it will still have a glass-like visual. The feature list includes big and small updates. On the more impactful side, the Phone and Photos apps have been redesigned. There will be several features leveraging artificial intelligence, such as live translation capabilities coming to Phone, FaceTime and Messages. Apple is also currently testing a sensitive content warning for child accounts that will freeze FaceTime video if nudity is detected by on-device machine learning tools. And the company is also launching Visual Intelligence, which will use AI to search for elements in an image. iOS 26 also has a litany of minor, quality of life improvements. Group texts are getting support for polls. And for the slow risers out there, iOS 26 will finally let you escape the tyranny of the nine minute snooze alarm . The next iOS is now available as a public beta . Here are our initial impressions of the Liquid Glass design and other new features. iOS 26 is compatible with all models back through iPhone 11. What other products are expected to be released alongside the iPhone 17? If Apple follows its usual pattern, the iPhone 17 will be announced alongside new Apple Watch products. That would be the Apple Watch Series 11 (if Apple sticks to the same naming scheme), and maybe an Apple Watch Ultra 3 and/or an updated Apple Watch SE. (They'll all run watchOS 26 , of course.) Other possibilities — and this is, again, speculation — could include refreshed Apple AirPods Pro (which received its last big update in 2022 ) and maybe new AirTags trackers (first released in 2021). The Apple rumor mill got a big shot in the arm this week thanks to the reported inclusion of product ID numbers in recent beta software builds. Per MacRumors , it's a laundry list of new hardware, including long-rumored product updates like the Apple TV , HomePod mini , new Apple Studio Display monitor and two fresh iPads. Of course, even if that list is totally accurate, we may not see those products until 2026 — if ever. So don't expect all of products to share the stage with the iPhone 17, especially since Apple likes to keep its star performer at the center of attention. That said, keep in mind that Apple has recently been having Mac-centric announcements in late October (as it did last year to debut new M4 Macs ), so there's always the chance of another shoe dropping a few weeks down the road.

(Apple) In just few weeks, Apple's annual iPhone event will likely be upon us, which means we'll finally get a look at the newest iPhone 17 lineup . In addition, the company will also give us an official date for downloading iOS 26 . Until that happens, you can download and install the newly released public beta 4 (or iOS 26 developer beta 7 for developers). I've been playing around with it for the past couple of weeks, and have found that taking screenshots is way better in the new operating system — Google and ChatGPT search options are now in the screenshots editor, for instance. You can see a more complete view of the new features in our preview of the iOS 26 public beta release , which shows off the fresh home and lock screen redesign. Called Liquid Glass , the new translucent look will extend across all of Apple's upcoming operating systems. The overhaul is one of several big changes coming to iOS, macOS , iPadOS and the rest of Apple's software suite, all of which were showcased during the company's WWDC keynote on June 9. After overpromising on AI plans last year, Apple kept its iOS roadmap focused more on basic quality of life improvements this year. There are multiple useful additions coming to the Phone and Messages apps on your iPhone, for instance: Apple execs outlined the ability to weed out spam texts or other unknown senders and an option to hold your spot on a phone call when you've been waiting for a representative to pick up. Plus, a treasured feature that we took for granted is coming back (hint: it's in the Photos app). Siri, meanwhile, is in a holding pattern. Apple has previously specified that its smarter voice assistant — first promised at WWDC 2024 — is delayed until some point \" in the coming year ,\" so you shouldn't expect any major changes in the current betas. But there are reports that Apple is aiming to give Siri a bigger brain transplant by basing it on third-party artificial intelligence models like OpenAI's ChatGPT or Anthropic's Claude, which could make 2026 a pivotal year. The company is also reportedly working on a 'stripped-down' AI chatbot to rival ChatGPT. With each beta, it seems like additional new improvements are popping up, like this new AirPods gesture we're all curious about, and this FaceTime feature that'll freeze your video if it detects nudity . With the release of the iOS 26 developer beta 5 , we saw more added features, like a new bouncy animation on the passcode screen and in the Control Center, MacRumors reports . Some or all of those changes will likely soon migrate into the separate public beta (see below). Most newer iPhone models are eligible to download iOS 26 (both the betas and final version). Want to see the full list of new features coming this fall? Read on. What is iOS 26? The current iPhone operating system is iOS 18, and Apple is still actively updating it — version 18.6.1 was released to restore Apple Watch blood oxygen monitoring functionality for certain users in the US. More recently, Apple released 18.6.2 to address a vulnerability related to image processing. But don't expect to see iOS 19 soon — or ever. Instead, Apple is skipping the numbering ahead to iOS 26 later this year. The company has decided to line up its iOS version numbers with a year-based system, similar to car model years. So while iOS and its sibling operating systems will be released in late 2025, they're all designated \"26\" to reflect the year ahead. It's official, we're moving to iOS 26. (Apple) What is Liquid Glass design? Let's be honest. Out of everything announced at WWDC this year, the new Liquid Glass design was the star of the show. The iPhone's home and lock screens have looked pretty much the same year after year — the last exciting thing (in my opinion) was the option to add your own aesthetic to your home screen by customizing your apps and widgets. So seeing the home and lock screens' new facelift is refreshing. So what exactly is Liquid Glass? Apple calls it a \" new translucent material \" since, well, the apps and widgets are clear. However, the screen can still adapt to dark and light modes, depending on surroundings. You'll also notice buttons with a new floating design in several apps, like Phone and Maps. They're designed to be less distracting than the current buttons, but are still easy to see. While the design overhaul has proven to be controversial since its announcement, some — including Engadget's own Devindra Hardawar — like the new direction, even if it's somewhat reminiscent of Microsoft's translucent Windows Vista Aero designs from nearly twenty years ago. That said, as of the release of the iOS 26 beta 2, Apple has already incorporated some user feedback into the design, dialing back the transparency in at least some places. And while it will continue to evolve, Apple users won't be able to escape it: Liquid Glass was designed to make all of Apple's OSes more cohesive. Here's a look at how the translucent aesthetic will look with the new macOS Tahoe 26 on your desktop. What are the new and notable features of iOS 26? iOS 26 has a laundry list of new features. Among the most worthwhile: Phone app redesign: You'll finally be able to scroll through contacts, recent calls and voicemail messages all on one screen. It also comes with a new feature called Hold Assist that'll notify you when an agent comes to the phone so you can avoid the elevator music and continue on with other tasks. Live Translation in Phone, FaceTime and Messages: iOS 26 is bringing the ability to have a conversation via phone call or text message with someone who speaks another language. Live Translation will translate your conversation in real time, which results in some stop-and-go interactions in the examples Apple shared during its presentation. Polls in group chats: Tired of sorting through what seems like hundreds of messages in your group chat? You and your friends will soon be able to create polls in group messages for deciding things like which brunch spot you're eating at or whose car you're taking on a road trip. Filtering unknown senders in Messages: If you haven't received spam texts about unpaid tolls or other citations, you're lucky. For those of us who have, those annoying messages will soon be filtered away in a separate folder. Visual Intelligence: Similar to a reverse Google image search, this new feature will allow you to search for anything that's on your iPhone screen. For instance, if you spot a pair of shoes someone is wearing in an Instagram photo, you can screenshot it and use Visual Intelligence to find those shoes (or similar ones) online. Photos tabs are back: For anyone who's still frustrated with the Photos changes made last year , you'll be happy to know that your tabs are coming back. Library and Collections will have their own separate spaces so you don't have to scroll to infinity to find what you're looking for. FaceTime \"Communication Safety\" feature: A newer addition to iOS 26 appears to be the FaceTime \"Communication Safety\" feature that pauses communications if and when nudity is detected. The feature appears to be a child safety feature that uses on-device detection, thus obviating any cloud-based privacy issues. New lock screen options : The iPhone lock screen gets more customizable in iOS 26, with a cooler clock, 3D wallpaper effects, more widgets and better focus mode options. Apple's Hold Assist will be nifty for those pesky services that put you on hold for 10 or more minutes. (Apple) New changes coming to iPadOS 26 Your iPad isn't getting left behind when it comes to big updates. Here's what's coming this fall. Multitasking and real windowing: When you download the newest update, you'll be able to have multiple apps running on your screen at the same time. Once you open an app, it'll appear on your screen as normal but you'll be able to resize and move it across your screen to make room for other apps. This feature is optional so you can turn it off if you don't like it. Visual update: Along with the other new OSes, iPadOS 26 is coming with the Liquid Glass aesthetic. This new look will appear on the lock and home screens, as well as the drop-down menus. New menu bar: When you swipe down on your screen, the new menu bar will appear with options like File, Edit, Windows and more. There's also a search option if you're looking for something specific. Check out our first impressions of iPadOS 26 . What about AirPods? AirPods are also getting updated with iOS 26. Here are some of the more notable functions. Enhanced audio recording: Apple calls this \"studio-quality\" audio recording, and with it, you'll notice more clarity while in noisy environments. Camera remote control: Using this, you can take a photo or start and stop video recording with just one press on your AirPods. When taking photos, you'll get a three-second countdown before your iPhone or iPad snaps the picture. Live translation feature: While not officially announced or confirmed, it appears that the long-rumored live translation for AirPods could be coming with iOS 26 . The evidence comes from a system asset spotted in the in iOS 26 beta showing a gesture that's triggered by pressing both earbud stems at the same time. The photo also shows words in several different languages. Which iPhones will be able to upgrade to iOS 26? A few iPhone models that run the current version of iOS — iPhone XR, XS and XS Max — won't be compatible with the latest upgrade. But any iPhones released in 2019 or later will be eligible for the iOS 26 update . iPhone SE (second generation or later) iPhone 11 iPhone 11 Pro iPhone 11 Pro Max iPhone 12 iPhone 12 mini iPhone 12 Pro iPhone 12 Pro Max iPhone 13 iPhone 13 mini iPhone 13 Pro iPhone 13 Pro Max iPhone 14 iPhone 14 Plus iPhone 14 Pro iPhone 14 Pro Max iPhone 15 iPhone 15 Plus iPhone 15 Pro iPhone 15 Pro Max iPhone 16 iPhone 16 Plus iPhone 16 Pro iPhone 16 Pro Max iPhone 16e Not listed here are the presumed new iPhone 17 models (or maybe iPhone 26?) that are all but certain to be announced and released in September. How to install iOS 26 beta The iOS 26 public beta is now available to download via the Apple Beta Software Program . If you're not already a member, you'll need to sign up to try out all the latest features. Just visit beta.apple.com and sign up with your phone number or email address. It's free. Once you're in, you can install it by going to Settings > General > Software Update and selecting iOS 26 public beta . A word of caution: Don't sign up with your main iPhone unless you're OK with any risks that occur with using an OS that isn't finalized. When will the final version of iOS 26 be released? iOS 26 will be released to the public this fall. It usually comes in September, within a week of the Apple iPhone event. Last year, it rolled out to iPhone users on September 16 — exactly one week after the iPhone 16 lineup was announced. If you're more interested in the Apple Intelligence features coming, here's everything Apple revealed for iOS, macOS and more during WWDC.

The second contains the video game stories from the past week that you need to know about, including some headlines from outside of Engadget. Please enjoy — and I'll see you next week. On a planet shrouded in myth, in a land surrounded by lore, on a mountain draped in mystery, in a cave suffocated by secrets, the legend sleeps. For six years, the legend has slumbered while wild stories spiral around it, twisting and expanding and entwining. New words have been born and old words infused with evolved meanings: Believer. Doubter. Silkpost. The lies have grown so thick they’ve become corporeal, spreading trickery with a name and a dead smile. For six years, the legend has slept while the masses roiled, all of them waiting for the signal to awaken and know truth. All of them waiting for a bell that will ring, finally and clearly, on Thursday, August 21, 2025. Skong . Skong . Skong . It’s a special time in the Silksong subreddit . After years of silence around its sequel, Hollow Knight: Silksong , Team Cherry has scheduled a livestream with a “special announcement” about the game for August 21 at 10:30AM ET. Not only is this exciting for Metroidvania fans everywhere, but it’s also possible that this announcement marks the final moments of the Silksong subreddit as we know it. A strange cocktail of game delays, inconsistent updates and hyper-focused cult fandom has cultivated a fascinating little universe in r/Silksong, complete with its own rules, villains and heroes. It’s a place where clown wigs are commonplace and contributors have turned trolling into a role-playing artform. A LARPform, if you will. It’s a place that’s consistently made me laugh every time it’s appeared in my feed over the past year or so. Ahead of Thursday’s special announcement, this sub is experiencing the last gasps of desperate myth-making and hopeless anticipation before it transforms into something else entirely, armed with actual information about the sequel, gameplay videos and maybe even a firm release date. Or, dare I say it, a surprise launch. For just a moment longer in r/Silksong, anything is possible. And then it’ll be over. No matter what happens during Thursday’s livestream, the day will come when Silksong comes out and the drip-feed of silkposts dries up completely. But for now, our face paint is ready. Sometimes it’s just nice to recognize the madness and the beauty of the moment, before it slips away for good. The news News from ONL 2025 Gamescom 2025 kicked off on Tuesday with Opening Night Live, a showcase hosted by Geoff Keighley and the folks behind The Game Awards, and there were plenty of delightful morsels on display.

ROG Xbox Ally lands in October Microsoft is slowly establishing its handheld era with news that the ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X will be available on October 16. There’s still no official word on how much they’ll cost, but there are hints: As spotted by Wario64 , Best Buy recently listed the Xbox Ally at $550 and the Xbox Ally X at $900, and these fall in line with our predictions, which were based on the prices of existing ROG Ally handhelds. Alongside the release date, Microsoft announced the Handheld Compatibility Program , an initiative aimed at optimizing games for portable devices and informing players about how well they perform. It’s essentially Steam Deck Verified, but for Xbox handhelds, and it’s yet another sign that Microsoft’s portable gaming ambitions stretch beyond just one hardware manufacturer. The PS5 will cost more tomorrow than it does today First Nintendo and Microsoft raised the prices of their latest consoles, and now it’s Sony’s turn. Sony on Wednesday announced the following price increases for the PS5 family: Standard PS5 with a disc drive: $550, up from $500 PS5 digital edition: $500, up from $450 PS5 Pro: $750, up from $700 Sony blames the increases on a “challenging economic environment,” echoing sentiments from its contemporaries. The price hikes come at a time in the hardware generation when we’re used to seeing consoles get cheaper, which just makes this whole thing more frustrating. Rod Fergusson is in charge of BioShock again and already making big changes There have been signs of turmoil at BioShock 4 studio Cloud Chamber for a while now, including news earlier this month that the game failed a review with 2K executives and was due for a complete narrative revamp. Now, we’re seeing even more fallout. Former Gears of War and Diablo head Rod Fergusson has left Blizzard to lead development of BioShock 4 at Cloud Chamber, and his appointment comes alongside news that 80 people at the studio are being laid off. This is actually the second time Fergusson has joined the development of a BioShock game at the last second — he similarly swooped in and cut aspects of BioShock: Infinite at Irrational Games in 2012. The race through development hell between Judas and BioShock 4 continues. Blizzard’s cinematic and narrative team is unionizing Microsoft is the home of another video game union. Workers with Blizzard Entertainment’s Story and Franchise Development team, which handles in-game cinematics and lore for titles including Overwatch and World of Warcraft , voted this week to unionize under the Communications Workers of America. This covers about 169 developers and it marks the fourth unionization effort from Microsoft’s gaming teams, joining QA workers at Activision , ZeniMax and Raven Software . Steam censorship is breaking PayPal PayPal isn’t a valid way to buy games on Steam in certain countries any longer. Steam in July removed hundreds of games with adult and NSFW themes from its storefront, and updated its policies to ban \"content that may violate the rules and standards” of its payment processors. This was incredibly vague and raised immediate concerns around financial censorship, especially when combined with a related culling of thousands of games from Itch.io . Now, it’s confirmed that PayPal has terminated its partnership with Steam in multiple countries, affecting any denomination “ other than EUR, CAD, GBP, JPY, AUD and USD.” Valve says it’s being pressured by payment processors including Visa, MasterCard and PayPal to remove certain games and implement puritanical censorship policies, and this has already resulted in at least one game being unjustly removed from the platform. That game, VILE: Exhumed , is now available as shareware . Roblox is changing its rules after so, so many child-safety lawsuits Roblox is locking down its system for sharing and viewing user-generated games following a wave of lawsuits accusing developers of failing to protect their young userbase. All unrated experiences, or user-created games, will be restricted to the developer and anyone actively working on them, rather than being available to anyone over the age of 13, as is currently the case. This change and others, including a new system that automatically detects and tracks \"violative scenes\" on individual servers, will roll out over the coming months. Analogue delayed its N64 remake again It’s now due out in Q4 2025. :( Additional reading Kris Holt’s indie game roundup More action than RPG, Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 struggles to convince after a few hours' play by Robert Purchese at Eurogamer This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/video-games-weekly-silksong-and-gamescom-221635822.html?src=rss", "ingested_utc": "2025-08-20T22:38:11Z"}

However, a new report suggests that AI also poses a fraud risk from the other direction — easily falling for scams that human users are much more likely to catch. The report, titled \"Scamlexity,\" comes from a cybersecurity startup called Guardio, which produces a browser extension designed to catch scams in real time. Its findings are concerned with so-called \"agentic AI\" browsers like Opera Neon , which browse the internet for you and come back with results. Agentic AI claims to be able to work on complex tasks, like building a website or planning a trip, while users kick back. There's a huge problem here from a security perspective: while humans are not always great at sorting fraud from reality, AI is even worse. A seemingly simple task like summarizing your emails or buying you something online comes with myriad opportunities to slip up. Lacking common sense, agentic AI may be prone to bumbling into obvious traps. The researchers at Guardio tested this hypothesis using Perplexity's Comet AI browser , currently the only widely available agentic browser. Using a different AI, they spun up a fake website pretending to be Walmart, then navigated to it and told Comet to buy them an Apple Watch. Ignoring several clues that the site wasn't legit, including an obviously wonky logo and URL, Comet completed the purchase, handing over financial details in the process. In another test, the study authors sent themselves an email pretending to be from Wells Fargo, containing a real phishing URL. Comet opened the link without raising any alarms and blithely dumped a bank username and password into the phishing site. A third test proved Comet susceptible to a prompt injection scam, in which a text box concealed in a phishing page ordered the AI to download a file. It's just one set of tests, but the implications are sobering. Not only are agentic AI browsers susceptible to new types of scam, they may also be uniquely vulnerable to the oldest scams in the book. AI is built to do whatever its prompter wants, so if a human user doesn't notice the signs of a scam the first time they look, the AI won't serve as a guardrail. This warning comes as every leader in the field bets big on agentic AI. Microsoft is adding Copilot to Edge , OpenAI debuted its Operator tool in January , and Google's Project Mariner has been in the works since last year. If developers don't start building better scam detection into their browsers, agentic AI risks becoming a massive blind spot at best — and a new attack vector at worst.

Developer The Game Bakers announced at the latest Future Games Show that Cairn will include a \"Free Solo\" mode that lets you tackle the game's already difficult climbs without pitons or a rope. A typical climb in Cairn — and most rock climbing games for that matter — tasks you with managing rope, and the pitons you use to anchor it to a rock face. You add pitons as you climb so that in the event you slip, you only fall to your last piton rather than all the way to the ground. In Free Solo mode, you don't have that safety net, turning each climb into more of a roguelike run. In the real life rock climbing world, \"Free Solo\" climbing is when you tackle a climb without a partner or traditional equipment. The term rose to mainstream relevance after the release of the documentary Free Solo , which followed climber Alex Honnold as he trained for and ultimately ascended El Capitan in Yosemite National Park. Adding a dangerous style of climbing to what's already a difficult game feels appropriate in this case. On top of a climbing mechanic that makes you move each limb individually, Cairn also requires you to manage your hunger, thirst and an inventory of supplies. At least based on its demo, the game is far more demanding then something like Jusant , which was much more concerned with making its traversal fun and expressive rather than realistically difficult. If you're itching for punishment, the Cairn demo is available to download now on PS5 and PC. The game will be released on both platforms on November 5, 2025.

The publication reported that Oracle has promised to develop tens of billions of dollars in data centers, which have become a hot business. Notably, Oracle landed a deal to back operations at OpenAI, in a partnership that will give the AI company 4.5 gigawatts of computing power . According to Bloomberg , that's enough energy to power \"millions of American homes.\" So far, Oracle has seemed willing to throw money at its AI data center projects, no matter how expensive or irresponsible the needs might be. For instance, a source said the company plans to spend more than $1 billion a year powering a single data center in Texas with gas generators rather than waiting for a utility connection to be built. When completed, this data center is expected to be one of the largest known sites, with computing power of 1.4 gigawatts. In addition to the huge monetary cost, such a project can also have negative human and environmental impact. The Elon Musk-owned xAI is under fire after a supercomputer for its artificial intelligence operations became a primary source of air pollution in Memphis thanks to methane-powered turbines. Other majors, including Google , Microsoft and Meta , have chosen to try nuclear power for their data center projects, which comes with its own potential complications and risks. Purely on the financial side, Oracle's decision to invest so much so quickly meant the company reported its first negative annual cash flow since 1990. Should the current rates of AI investment turn out to be a bubble, it could be very bad news to have many billions of dollars on the line.

The company announced its third delay to the Analogue 3D on Wednesday, pushing the retro system back to Q4 2025. However, it said that's an intentionally conservative estimate, so this probably isn't a huge concern. The postponement follows previous ones in March and July. (The last time was due to tariffs .) Analogue acknowledged the frustration pre-order customers must be feeling. \"We know this sucks,\" the Pocket maker wrote. \"Another delay, announced late, after months of patience. We feel it too.\" The Analogue 3D uses an FPGA (field programmable gate array) chip to emulate N64 hardware. The company promises it will work with every official N64 cartridge ever released without any slowdowns or inaccuracies. Analogue So, why bother with the $250 console when you can grab a used Nintendo 64 for under $100? Well, Analogue's take supports 4K output, variable refresh rate displays and both PAL and NTSC carts. It's also adding \"original display mode\" filters to simulate old-school TVs. (They're similar to those you find on the company's highly rated Analogue Pocket handheld console .) Analogue says the system is 99 percent done — including hardware, system and packaging. \"The last 1% is where we're focused,\" the company wrote. It says it wants every detail to meet its high standards. Nonetheless, pre-orderers who wish to bail can do so by contacting support. Frustrations aside, delays are indeed better than shipping incomplete products — even if only by one percent. \"We're pushing without pause and appreciate everyone's patience and trust,\" the company wrote in an email to customers. \"Analogue will always deliver — delays or not, it's a commitment to our standard of care.\" This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/analogue-delays-its-n64-remake-console-yet-again-205343467.html?src=rss", "ingested_utc": "2025-08-20T21:33:37Z"}

However, Android phone makers haven’t exactly been rushing to add Qi2 support to their latest devices since then. That’s made finding a compatible handset rather difficult, which is a bummer for anyone who has seen the wealth of accessories and power banks that iPhone owners have had access to for several generations. On top of faster charging speeds (up to 25 watts or higher in later revisions), Qi2 dictates the inclusion of embedded magnets designed to make aligning and attaching peripherals a cinch. But what makes the slow rollout a bit more frustrating is that Apple is a member of the Wireless Power Consortium (the governing body in charge of Qi2) and its MagSafe tech was used to help define the spec and ensure that compliant add-ons work seamlessly with Qi2, so it’s not like there’s a lack of compatible peripherals. Regardless, to help you figure out which Android phones officially come with Qi2, we’ve compiled a list of supported devices. (Note: Due to the complexities of the Chinese market, this list is primarily focused on gadgets available in North America and the EU.) Android phones with Qi2: The HMD Skyline . The Google Pixel 10 family . That’s it, seriously. Though now this list does include one of the biggest Android phone makers in Google. That said, there is one wrinkle with the Pixel 10 line. While Google's Pixelsnap standard is Qi2 compatible, wireless charging speeds for the base Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro are staying the same at 15 watts. However, only the Pixel 10 Pro XL comes with support for the more powerful Qi2.2 spec which allows for wireless charging at up to 25 watts. So if you want the convenience of cable-free magnetic charging and want to do it as fast as possible, you're going to have to pay extra for the most premium version of the Pixel 10. The status of other Android phone manufacturers But what about the Galaxy S25? Unfortunately, despite Samsung saying that it will release multiple “Android devices supporting Qi2” this year, its latest batch of flagship phones (including S25 Edge, Galaxy Z Flip 7 and Galaxy Z Fold 7 ) are merely \"Qi2 ready.\" But what does that mean? Like previous models, the Galaxy S25 family can charge wirelessly at up to 15 watts. However, because the phones don't have magnets on their back, Qi2 accessories slide off when you try to attach them. This can be addressed by purchasing a compatible case with a built-in magnetic mounting system or a magnetic ring mount, but at least out of the box, the Galaxy S25 line requires additional assistance in order to work with the growing market of Qi2 peripherals. OnePlus also claims the OnePlus 13 supports Qi2. However, in our testing, the magnets inside the phone are so weak that it didn't latch on securely to any of the Qi2 accessories we tested. However, similar to the Galaxy S25, if you pair the OnePlus 13 with one of the company's magnetic cases, you can attach Qi2 peripherals as normal. Finally, when asked if it had plans to release Qi2-compatible phones, Motorola would only say that it is \"committed to bringing the latest technology across our devices.\" As new phones with Qi2 hit the market, we will try to keep this list as up-to-date as possible. Or at least until the spec becomes a much more mainstream standard. Update, August 20 2025, 4:45PM ET: This story has been updated with info about Qi2 support on the Pixel 10 family.

The company teased the upcoming feature alongside the announcement of the launch date for the first Xbox-branded handhelds and the company's new compatibility system for figuring out if games will run well on handhelds. Shader stutter is a widespread issue in PC gaming that doesn't occur on consoles because of their uniform hardware. You have to download shaders for a PC game to make sure that they run correctly on your specific hardware. Typically, a game downloads shaders when they're first launched, which can add to the wait before you can actually start playing, and lead to things like framerate drops as shaders are compiled in the background. Microsoft's system \"preloads game shaders during download\" which the company says will allow games to launch up to 10 times faster, \"run smoother, and use less battery on first play.\" It sounds like this new shader delivery system will require some amount of buy-in from developers, which means it likely won't impact every game at launch. It's just one of the ways Microsoft is trying to address the complexity and inefficiency Windows 11 can add to gaming. Besides including easier access to features like the Game Bar and ASUS' Armoury Crate software, the company also says that its handheld version of Windows will \"minimize background activity and defer non-essential tasks\" to devote more resources to playing games. Microsoft wants theses handhelds to be a success, so it makes sense to put in the work. But in a world where Xbox home consoles look even more like Windows PCs, the company might also be making improvements now that it can take advantage of later.

Despite its tone shifting between action-horror games and more pure horror entries, where players face down grotesque moments with scant resources, the series still manages to place players in tense encounters that define the series' against-all-odds approach to horror. And with the upcoming Resident Evil Requiem — or RE9 — appears to continue the series' current momentum in delivering compelling horror experiences. Just ahead of Gamescom 2025, I got to experience the opening of Resident Evil Requiem , focusing on new protagonist Grace Ashcroft (daughter of Alyssa Ashcroft from Resident Evil Outbreak ) and her desperate attempt at fleeing a horrifying clinic within a strange mansion. Capcom's return to traditional survival horror was one of the best games showcased at Summer Game Fest 2025 , and spending more time with it recently made me appreciate the series' renewed vision — even if it's a bit familiar. Much like recent core entries in the Resident Evil series — VII and Village — Resident Evil Requiem places a keen focus on immersion, truly capturing that sense of dread as you walk down the halls of an unnerving facility. The larger story of Requiem seems to be pointing towards a homecoming of sorts for the series' most pivotal event — the destruction of Raccoon City in Resident Evil 2 and 3 . While Requiem 's story will expand into a more ambitious scope, the demo I played focused on Grace's harrowing attempt to escape her abductors. In this sequence, Grace frees herself from an inverted hospital gurney and finds herself trapped in a ruined clinic filled with the bodies of dead doctors. In keeping with the brand of horror from the Resident Evil 2 remake and Resident Evil Village , I was being stalked by an imposing, grotesque monster hiding in the ceilings. Without weapons and with only empty bottles for distractions and sources of light to keep the beast at bay, the sequence felt very much like a stealth puzzle sequence, where I had to examine the movements of the beast and figure out a way to maneuver around it. I had previously seen this particular sequence during Summer Game Fest 2025. While I was impressed with its presentation — which features some of the most impressive lighting and character rendering I've seen from Capcom's RE Engine — I found the premise and scenario to be somewhat too familiar than I would have liked. Since Resident Evil VII , the series has leaned heavily into putting players in the series' most vulnerable moments, which often entail being stalked by imposing foes without any means to defend oneself. Capcom That sense of vulnerability can often feel played out, especially within the current horror game space, where running away from things is its sub-genre. However, getting to play Resident Evil Requiem properly made me appreciate Capcom's attempt to maintain the momentum from Resident Evil VII . And a lot of that had to do with the fact that Requiem now stars a more fully defined protagonist. Ethan Winters from VII and Village was a faceless protagonist with somewhat generic motivations, but he gradually became more well-rounded by the end of his story in Village . Now, with Grace, we're thrust into an unfamiliar situation, as she's more of an active participant in the story — talking to herself throughout the demo — and I felt a stronger connection to her sense of vulnerability as a protagonist. One of my favorite moments from the preview came shortly after I encountered the monster for the first time. After evading it, I went to the clinic's waystation to find a tool to open a fuse box. As I was wheeling a cart over to an elevated toolbox, the creature came into the room. As I tried hiding behind the cart, the monster spotted me and smashed the cart into me, which sent Grace hurling back to the wall. The beast then grabbed Grace and took a giant bite out of her shoulder. I used up my only health item and fled the room, returning to the well-lit safe that started the preview. Once the monster was gone, I snuck back into the waystation to retrieve the item — but more carefully this time around. It was a scary moment, but still totally exciting, and it had me on edge for the rest of the preview. Capcom Much like Resident Evil VII and Village , Requiem is by default a first-person game, which certainly creates a palpable sense of dread and uneasiness when exploring with a limited perspective. However, Requiem also adds the option to switch to third-person , which was introduced post-launch for Resident Evil Village and its DLC, Shadows of Rose. Having played the demo from both perspectives, I was impressed with how well the presentation feels tuned for both styles. The third-person perspective captures that sense of dread and adds in the expanded visibility, which gave me a clear and distressing view of the monster stalking me from behind as I ran towards the safe room. In the final stretch of my preview, I had all the tools I needed to make my exit. However, the storm outside the building blew out the lights in the area, allowing the monster to give chase. This sprint to the finish was tense and riveting. Even having seen the demo hands-off months prior, playing the sequence on my own made for a captivating experience. Once Grace made her exit, she had one last confrontation with the monster before the demo came to an abrupt end. Capcom So far, Resident Evil Requiem feels like a souped-up version of the immersive survival horror found in recent entries of the series — and it does very well based on this preview. I appreciated just how atmospheric this one, fairly limited, area of the preview was — seeing the long stretch of the hallway, with only my lighter and a dim red light illuminating in the distance, made for a striking visual — especially with the silhouette of the monster looming in the distance. That said, as well made as these sequences were, I'm already looking forward to seeing what sort of other tricks and events Requiem has in store. While I was a bit mixed on Village 's Resident Evil amusement park-style structure, I'm hoping Requiem will still take some big swings with its new twist on the series' survival horror. I have plenty of questions about Resident Evil Requiem , but I'm intrigued about what's to come for this series' next big move ahead. Resident Evil Requiem will be released on February 27, 2026 for PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S.

Gemini for Home will replace Google Assistant on the company's smart home devices, and will apparently be available in both free and paid versions, implying Google is interested in expanding its subscription business, not unlike Amazon is with Alexa+ . Google originally demoed Gemini for Home back at CES 2025 . At the time, the company was primarily promising that generative AI would make conversations with smart devices more natural by removing the need for wooden voice commands. You can speak to Gemini like you would a human being and get the results you'd expect, whether its an answer to a trivia question or an adjustment to your thermostat. The real promise of Gemini integration is how the AI assistant's multimodal features could use inputs from other Nest devices — a video feed from a security camera, for example — to answer more complex questions about what's happening in your home. For Google's October early access rollout release, the company seems to be guaranteeing all of those same improvements, on top of offering access to Gemini Live for even more personalized conversations. What Google's blog post doesn't cover is how much all this costs and what Gemini features will be locked behind a subscription. Back at CES, the company said that Nest Aware subscribers — who pay $10 per month — would get early access to Gemini in Google Home later this year. The paid version of the AI assistant could just be rolled into Google's existing subscription, but the company might also offer it as a separate add-on. Gemini for Home launches in early access in October. Google says it will \"share more details soon\" about the rollout. Maybe that news will be paired with the release of a new Nest speakers and smart displays. The last Nest Hub was released in 2021, which suggests the lineup is more than due for a refresh.

Amazon has joined the hype train early, as it now offers gift cards when pre-ordering one of these handsets . The gift cards range in value from $100 to $300, depending on what device is purchased. Perhaps the most notable is a $200 gift card when pre-ordering the Pixel 10 Pro with 128GB of storage. This model costs $1,000, so that basically drops the price down to $800. The Pixel 10 Pro offers wireless charging , an improved camera system, a brighter display and a bigger battery than last year's model. It ships on August 28. Pre-ordering the bigger and beefier Pixel 10 Pro XL with 256GB of storage provides a $200 Amazon gift card. This one costs $1,200 and ships on August 28. The base Pixel 10 smartphone with 128GB of storage also hits stores on that date and comes with a $100 gift card . The price for the entry-level handset is $800. Finally, there's the Pixel 10 Pro Fold. The 512GB version of this foldable comes with a $300 gift card , which is enough to really do some damage on Amazon. There are some caveats. This one costs $1,900 and doesn't ship until October 9 . All of this gift card madness ends on September 4. In other words, scoop up a pre-order in the near future to get one.

Thanks to a parade of leaks, we think we know mostly what to expect today — Pixel 10 phones, along with new watches and earbuds — but we'll know for sure later today. That's because the event kicks off at 1PM ET. If you want to be the first to hear the official scoop, you can tune into the Made by Google YouTube channel (or right here!) to catch Google's event, which will be hosted by Jimmy Fallon and also include other celebrities like Stephen Curry , Lando Norris and the Jonas Brothers — get ready for some potentially awkward cue card readings! And open a second window to follow our Pixel event liveblog for real-time analysis. What's on tap? You can expect a more power-efficient Tensor G5 processor in all the new Pixel 10 phones. (That could help power new Gemini AI features , too.) The base-level Pixel 10 should get a big camera upgrade: a 5x telephoto lens. Before this generation, you had to splurge on a Pro or Fold model to get optical zoom. Cameras will be higher-res across the board, too. In other areas, Qi2 magnetic charging is expected to come to the new Pixels. Expect a new accessory ecosystem, a la Apple's MagSafe , dubbed \"Pixelsnap.\" We'll also likely see the Pixel Watch 4 with a larger battery and smaller bezels . And the Pixel Buds 2a could bring refinements to the company's budget earbuds . Sam Rutherford for Engadget Engadget's Pixel 10 leak roundup will give you a much more detailed dive into the rumors. You can head back here on August 20 at 1PM ET to watch live.

(Google, Sam Rutherford/Engadget) Last month, the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 was released and immediately became the de facto king of the foldable phone hill. But today a new challenger has arrived: The Pixel 10 Pro Fold . Initial details are now available, and Google is having a splashy launch event to introduce it (and the full new Pixel 10 line ) to the world. These two smartphones are vying for the title of best foldable — both with very similar designs, but each bringing something unique to the table. Samsung launched its first foldable phone in 2019, so it's had quite a bit of time to refine the Galaxy Fold over the years. Google on the other hand just released its first Pixel Fold a couple years ago — but has already largely evened the match . And, of course, with enhanced Gemini AI software integration front and center, you'll have access to Google's impressive artificial intelligence features at nearly every turn. We'll break down how the Pixel 10 Pro Fold and Galaxy Z Fold 7 stack up to one another. You can also check out our comparison of the Pixel 9 Pro Fold and the Galaxy Fold 6 to see how much has changed in a year. For more, see everything else that was announced at the Made by Google Pixel event today, including the Pixel Watch 4 . Price First things first, how much will one of these high-tech folding phones cost you? That is the make-or-break question, after all. The newest Pixel foldable is still less expensive than this year's Z Fold: it starts at $1,799 while the Galaxy smartphone starts at $2,000. You don't have any other real choices for \"book-style\" foldables in the US market. The OnePlus Open can be had for $1,499, but it's almost two years old. And Apple's most expensive phone is currently the $1,599 1TB iPhone 16 Pro Max — but as a non-foldable model with just a single screen, it's hardly a straight comparison. If the rumor mill is to be believed, Apple may finally bow a foldable iPhone in 2026 . Dimensions and display It's a race for the largest display and Samsung won this time — but not by much. The Galaxy Z Fold is just a hair bigger than the Pixel Pro Fold. Both phones' inner displays are 8 inches across when fully opened, while Samsung comes out ahead on the outer display with 6.5 inches (the Pixel is 6.4 inches). As for height, the new foldable Pixel phone is 6.1 inches and the Galaxy Z is 6.2 inches — not a huge difference there. When unfolded, the Samsung wins on size efficiency, packing the identically sized 8-inch internal display into an area that's 0.3 inches smaller — 5.6 inches versus the Pixel's 5.9. This year, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold’s displays have been upgraded to a Super Actua Flex OLED display with ultra-thin glass. Both the front screen and back cover come equipped with Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2. As for the Galaxy Z Fold 7, it has a Dynamic AMOLED display (inner and outer) and comes with the Corning Gorilla Glass Ceramic 2 on the front and the Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the backside. The glass is ultra-thin, yet it's 50 percent thicker than before. While slightly bigger, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is still lighter than the Pixel 10 Pro Fold. The Samsung model weighs only 7.6 ounces — down nearly an ounce from its 2024 model — while its Google competition comes in at 9.1 ounces (the same as last year's model). The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 (left) compared to the new Pixel 10 Pro Fold (right). (Sam Rutherford/Engadget) Processor, RAM, storage and battery The Pixel 10 Fold Pro runs the Tensor G5 chip — Google says its CPU features 34 percent better performance compared to the Tensor G4 chip. The Z Fold 7 is powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy. \"Everything feels fast and snappy,\" Engadget's Sam Rutherford said of the Snapdragon 8 Elite performance on the Z Fold 7. (Sam also has first impressions of the Pixel 10 Pro Fold , but speed tests will happen a bit later.) Both phones offer the choice of 256GB, 512GB or 1TB storage. On the RAM front, the Pixel Fold delivers 16GB across the line, while the Samsung model reserves that level for the top 1TB storage tier; the small models get 12GB instead. The Galaxy phone will cost you $2,419 if you decide you need the maximum amount of storage, whereas the Pixel Fold tops out at $2,149. When it comes to battery life, Samsung's foldable lasts up to 24 hours with a 4,400mAh battery. The Pixel lasts up to 30 hours thanks to a more capacious 5,015mAh battery rating. Furthermore, the Pixel Fold is certified for Qi2 wireless charging, which Google is branding as \" Pixelsnap \" across its 2025 Pixel line for the first time.. Color options If you like having multiple colors to choose from, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is winning in this category. It comes in Mint, Jetblack, Blue Shadow and Silver Shadow. Mint is only available if you buy your phone online — you won't be seeing that one in stores. As for the Pixel 10 Fold Pro, your options are Moonstone and Jade.

I initially imagined it would be a Pixel Ring — something that would fit into the existing wearable portfolio that includes the Pixel Watch and Pixel Buds. But at a recent roundtable with the heads of Google’s Health, Fitbit and Wearables businesses, I was presented a more compelling possibility. When CNN ’s Lisa Eadicicco asked the question on everyone’s mind about whether Google would expand its wearable product portfolio with other types of gadgets, the answer surprised me. After first giving an expected “nothing to share as yet” response, Sandeep Waraich, the senior director of product management for Google Wearables, pointed towards the Fitbit family. “We see there’s a big opportunity with a discrete device that lasts very long [and] has a simple experience that’s very focused on health and fitness.” Waraich continued by saying “today, Fitbit has a pretty robust portfolio but it has not been refreshed for a while, so that’s where we see opportunity and we have been deeply thinking about bringing the right experiences.” He did not reveal much more upon further pushing, but one thing became clear to me. If Google were to make a smart ring, it would be part of the Fitbit family. That makes a lot of sense, if you consider the activity trackers that Fitbit is synonymous with. They are fairly basic wristworn devices that do little more than count your steps, track your heart rate and occasionally vibrate to tell you to look at your phone. You could say they’re unsophisticated, but they’re also simple and serve very specific purposes. Plus, they last forever — clocking between days and weeks on a charge. As someone who loathes wearing any device to bed, I’m frustrated at the lack of options available to me for sleep-tracking. Bed sensors don’t seem to get very accurate data, while bedside radar or motion detectors (like the Nest Hub or Amazon’s retired Halo RIse) have been largely abandoned by their makers. A smart ring, like the Galaxy Ring or Oura, are effective and comfortable solutions. The thing is, a lot of my digital data is housed in Google services. I’m a Gmail girl, and I pay quite a lot every month for a generous amount of Drive storage. A Google-powered sleep tracker appeals to my data hoarder tendencies. Throw in the fact that Fitbit has long led the way in accurate and sophisticated sleep and activity tracking, and a Fitbit Ring’s potential grows significantly. Of course, there’s always the risk that, should Google make a smart ring, it might give up on the product after a few years, rendering my data or device useless. Just look at the Google graveyard . I will say that Waraich and his colleagues seem to see a future where people have multiple devices that serve various, specific purposes. A smartwatch and smart ring could both coexist as useful accessories that feed into a person’s main device, which these days is usually a smartphone. In addition to those gadgets, people likely also own laptops, TVs and tablets — screens of all sizes. In response to a follow-up question on the topic of a multi-device lifestyle, Google’s general manager of Health and Home Rishi Chandra said “There’s no doubt we need to maximize the devices you already have.” But he added “there’s no doubt in my mind there’s going to be new form factors that will exist.” He cautioned, though, that “it’s too early to have conviction,” stating that currently the team is in the “experimentation phase.” “We are experimenting,” Chandra said. What comes out of that experimentation and what sticks around ultimately depends on developments in the industry that no one can assuredly predict. I do think, though, that given the company’s expertise in simple, straightforward activity trackers, a Fitbit Ring would not be too much of a stretch. Plus, the fact that the Oura Ring is now in its fourth generation and that it and the Galaxy Ring have proven to be worthwhile devices show that there is a market for this category.

Games will be badged as \"Handheld Optimized,\" indicating games with default controller inputs, appropriate resolution for full-screen play and more. Games badged as \"Mostly Compatible\" may require minor in-game setting adjustments for an optimal experience on the Xbox Ally handheld. Microsoft says it will continue to partner with developers to submit their titles for handheld compatibility testing. In addition to the \"Handheld Optimized\" badge, games will also be given a Windows Performance Fit indicator of either \"Should play great\" or \"Should play well.\" Microsoft says these signal \"compatibility and performance fit,\" but really it's anyone's best guess what that means or how it's different from the Handheld Performance badge.

The Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity, or C2PA , designed an open technical standard that essentially enforces transparency on a piece of media, providing information on how it was created and what, if any, modifications have been made. Appearing as a digital watermark (the C2PA likens it to a nutrition label), Content Credentials will be present in all photos taken by a Pixel 10 camera, and that imprint will also be viewable by anyone using Google Photos. The camera features on the latest Pixel phones are more pumped full of AI than ever, making it possible to apply edits in Google Photos using text or natural language voice prompts describing what you want. This in theory allows anyone lacking photo editing skills to bypass the manual process entirely, and by tapping on different parts of the photo you can get Gemini-powered suggestions on what edits to make. Google joined the C2PA last year , assisting with the development of the latest version of Content Credentials and eventually building the tech into Google Search, so that any image containing CP2A metadata would be identifiable as such. The standard is now supported in Google Images, Lens and Circle to Search, as well as the Pixel 10 phones announced today. Content Credentials will gradually roll out to Android and iOS devices running Google Photos in the coming weeks.

The headline attraction at the event is the Pixel 10 lineup, but there's plenty of other interesting stuff on offer too, such as the Pixel Watch 4, Pixel Buds 2a and — of course — a bunch of AI-related announcements. Google has also confirmed something many folks have been waiting for: its take on MagSafe. The company is calling its version Pixelsnap. Here's a look at everything that announced at the Made by Google event, along with links to our more in-depth coverage of each product and our hands-on impressions: Pixel 10 A tenth birthday is typically cause for a special celebration. The Pixel brand isn't quite that old yet (the original Google Pixel arrived in 2016), but there might still be enough to the base Pixel 10 to make fans don a conical hat and blow a party horn. For one thing, this is the first non-Pro Pixel phone to boast a telephoto lens. It is a 5x optical zoom lens, but it supports 10x optical image quality with the help of cropping and computational photography. Using the Super Res Zoom feature can give you a 20x zoom equivalent. Along with the telephoto lens, the Pixel 10 has 48MP wide and 13MP ultrawide sensors on the rear, as well as a 10.5MP selfie lens. As with the other phones in this year's lineup, the Pixel 10 runs on the Google Tensor G5 chip. It's said to be 34 percent faster than the Tensor G4 chipset and it's the first chipset that runs the Gemini Nano model. According to Google, that supports more than 20 generative AI experiences that run locally. The user interface is in line for some changes too. The company says Material 3 will support expressive photo wallpapers, customizable quick settings and improved typography. All of that should look pretty good on the Actua display, which delivers up to 3,000 nits of brightness. Google also claims that the Pixel 10's battery can power the device for more than 30 hours, up from the 24-plus hours for which the Pixel 9 lineup was rated. When you use a 30W adapter, you'll be able to charge the Pixel 10 to 55 percent of its capacity (i.e. 16-plus hours of use) in 30 minutes. In addition, the handset boasts a satin metal finish, Gorilla Glass Victus 2 and an IP68 rating for dust and water resistance. The Pixel 10 will shelves on August 28. It starts at $799 and will be available in Obsidian, Frost, Lemongrass and Indigo colorways. Read more about the Pixel 10 . Pixel 10 Pro / Pro 10 XL Sam Rutherford for Engadget How would you like that thing we just told you about but with higher specs and maybe a larger display? The Pixel 10 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro XL each boast a 50MP wide lens, a 48MP ultrawide and a 48MP 5x telephoto lens. Google claims this is its best camera system in a smartphone to date. There's more memory in these models too, with 16GB of RAM versus 12GB in the base Pixel 10. (The Pixel 10 Pro Fold has 16GB of RAM too.) The Super Actua displays are about 10 percent brighter than on the Pixel 9 Pro series, with 2,200 nits of full-screen brightness or 3,300 peak when viewing HDR content, and that's while consuming less power than previous models. The Pixel 10 Pro has a 6.3-inch screen while the Pixel 10 Pro XL has a 6.8-inch display, and each has a variable refresh rate of up to 120Hz. As with the base Pixel 10, the Pro models are slated to have more than 30 hours of battery life on a single charge. The Pixel 10 Pro supports 30W fast charging, while you can top up a Pixel 10 Pro XL with 45W of fast charging. Both support Qi2, but in what's said to be a first for a phone, the 10 Pro XL offers 25W wireless charging via Qi2.2 compatibility. The Pixel 10 Pro XL has upgraded speakers too, with what Google claims is loud and powerful bass, along with full and balanced stereo audio. The Pixel 10 Pro and 10 Pro XL will be available in Moonstone, Jade, Porcelain and Obsidian colorways on August 28, with pre-orders opening up today. The Pixel 10 Pro starts at $999 for 128GB of storage and the Pixel 10 Pro XL will run you $1,199 for 256GB of storage. Read more about the Pixel 10 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro XL. Pixel 10 Pro Fold Sam Rutherford for Engadget Of course, there's a fourth phone in the Pixel 10 lineup this fall. Google made durability a priority on the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, which has an IP68 rating for dust and water resistance (a first for a foldable, the company says). A new gearless hinge will help with that — Google says it's twice as durable as the hinge in the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. In fact, the company claims the Pixel 10 Pro Fold is designed to handle over 10 years of folding. The internal, eight-inch Super Actua Reflex display (said to be the largest on any phone), and outer 6.4-inch Actua display both deliver up to 3,000 nits of brightness. Google says it redesigned the interior with resilient, ultra-thin glass, along with dual anti-impact layers to help protect it from drops. The Pixel 10 Pro Fold is said to have the largest battery in a foldable yet, with a 5,015mAh capacity. As with the rest of the Pixel 10 lineup, there's Qi2 wireless charging support — an apparent first for a foldable. Alternatively, you'll be able to charge the battery to half of its capacity in 30 minutes with a 30W adapter, Google says. The triple-camera array includes a new 48MP main sensor, along with a 10.5MP ultrawide lens with macro focus and a 10.8MP telephoto lens. A feature called Instant View will show recently-taken pictures alongside the viewfinder. Google says it improved multitasking as well, with split-screen functionality that supports app resizing and the option to drag and drop files. The Pixel 10 Pro Fold comes in Moonstone and Jade colorways, but it'll arrive later than the rest of the Pixel 10 family — it's scheduled to land on October 9. It starts at $1,799 for 256GB of storage. If you're willing to splash out more cash, though, you can have up to 1TB of onboard storage, the first time that's been an option in a Pixel Pro Fold. Read more about the Pixel 10 Pro Fold. Pixelsnap Sam Rutherford for Engadget As mentioned above, all of the Pixel 10 devices have Qi2 wireless charging capabilities built-in, but Google is expanding on that with its own, long-awaited spin on MagSafe. Google's take is called Pixelsnap. The company is offering a slew of magnetic accessories for Pixel 10 devices, including cases, a charging puck, charging stand and non-charging ring stand. Read more about Pixelsnap . AI updates Sam Rutherford for Engadget This being Google in the Gregorian calendar year of 2025, of course there are a bunch of AI features coming to the Pixel 10 lineup (some should trickle down to older models later). Magic Cue might be the handiest of the latest tools. This is said to deliver proactive suggestions based on your activity by pulling data from the likes of Gmail and Google Calendar. For instance, if you're calling your airline, Magic Cue might pull up your flight details. If a friend asks for the address of your Airbnb vacation rental, Magic Cue could bring that up to save you some time. There are plenty of other AI tools on the way to Pixel 10 devices. I am an abysmal photographer, so Camera Coach sounds like it could be a genuinely useful feature for people like me. When you point the cameras at a subject or scene you want to capture, Gemini kicks into gear to analyze what the lenses are picking up. The feature will offer composition and framing suggestions, and suggest camera modes to employ. Gemini Live can offer visual guidance with on-screen overlays. Meanwhile, the Guided Frame feature will describe what the camera sees, primarily to assist blind and low-vision users. This is said to work on any scene and seems (at least on the surface) similar to services like Be My Eyes . Sam Rutherford for Engadget Other Pixel 10 AI camera tools include Auto Best Take, which can seemingly pick out the best group photo from multiple options. As for adjusting images, the Conversational Editing feature harnesses Gemini to help you tweak things using natural language voice prompts. You might ask it to adjust lighting, change the framing of a shot or remove objects, and hopefully Gemini will be able to handle those without a hitch. In addition, Pixel 10 devices are the first phones to implement C2PA (Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity) content credentials directly in the camera app. This is an industry standard labeling system for content that's created or modified using generative AI. Elsewhere, Pixel translation tools could be in line for a serious upgrade with Voice Translate. Google says this feature will be able to translate calls in real-time in your own voice. Google has folded a new native audio model into Gemini Live that's said to control the emotional tone and be capable of detecting a user's emotions. AI could help you better manage your calls too. The Call Message function will keep missed and declined calls separate from spam, and offer real-time transcripts as well as suggestions for next steps. Gboard writing tools, Pixel Studio and NotebookLM integration are in line for updates too. Sam Rutherford for Engadget Last but not least, Pixel 10 devices have a Pixel Journal app that will remain private ( following in Apple's footsteps to a degree). The app harnesses AI to offer prompts that may help you track your progress and record your thoughts. Read more about the Pixel 10 AI features. Pixel Watch 4 Sam Rutherford for Engadget Let's move on from phones and take a gander at Google's latest smartwatch. The Pixel Watch 4 has a new dome-style display that's 10 percent larger than the screen on the Pixel Watch 3. It can reach up to 3,000 nits of brightness. Battery life is said to be improved too, with Google claiming it can power the wearable for up to 40 hours on a single charge. Google has also made it easier to replace the screen and battery this time around too, though we'll have to see it in person before we can judge how easy it is to actually do. Other features include satellite connectivity for emergencies (when you're out of range of Wi-Fi and cell towers), an electrocardiogram app and irregular heart rhythm notifications. Google says the Pixel Watch 4 will be able to detect when a wearer's heart stops beating and contact emergency services. There will also be an AI-based personal fitness coach . Fitbit Premium subscribers will be the first to gain access to that. The Pixel Watch 4 will be available in in two sizes, 41mm and 45mm. It starts at $349 and will hit shelves on October 9. Read more about the Pixel Watch 4 and AI personal fitness coach . Pixel Buds 2a and Pixel Buds Pro 2 updates Sam Rutherford for Engadget Google hasn't forgotten about its earbuds here either. The company is releasing the the Pixel Buds 2a with active noise cancellation (ANC), powered by a Tensor A1 chip. Even with this upgrade, these are Google's lightest and smallest A-Series earbuds to date. They're IP54 rated for dust and water resistance, while the charging case has an IPX4 rating. The Tensor A1 chip is also said to deliver improved quality for calls and other audio, while supporting Gemini and other AI features in the Pixel Buds 2a. These earbuds are said to have double the battery life of their predecessors at 10 hours on a single charge, with the case adding 17 hours of listening time (seven and 13 hours, respectively, when ANC is enabled). The Pixel Buds 2a will be available on October 9 in Hazel and Iris colorways. However, due to these upgrades, the Pixel Buds 2a will cost $130, which is $31 more than the previous generation. Meanwhile, Google is offering the Pixel Buds Pro 2 in a new colorway, Moonstone, to match some of the Pixel 10 devices. A software update in September will introduce more features to the Pixel Buds Pro 2, including protection from certain sudden loud noises, the ability to adjust audio based on the volume of your surroundings, a way to answer or dismiss calls with head gestures and advanced audio processing for Gemini Live.

At its Made by Google event today in New York, Google detailed a suite of new machine learning and AI features that will debut with the Pixel 10 series before making their way to earlier models. The first new tool most people are likely to encounter is Magic Cue. As you're texting your friends, Gemini Nano , Google's private on-device model, will populate the conversation with contextual suggestions. For example, if a friend asks about a dinner reservation you two made last week, the Pixel 10 will display a shortcut you can tap to send them a Google Maps listing. Magic Cue depends on there being a digital paper trail to work. You can long press the shortcuts it generates to see where Gemini sourced the information it's relaying to you. In the case of the example above, it may have come from your personal Gmail. Sam Rutherford for Engadget The feature has extensions throughout Android. For instance, if a family member texts you about a flight you two are about to take, Magic Cue will not only provide the number of the airline, it will also display information about your flight on screen for easy reference. On the Discover page, which you can access on nearly every Android device by swiping to the leftmost page of your phone's home screen, there's a new shortcut to a feature called the Daily Hub. Like Samsung's Now Brief , it's a page with an AI-generated summary of the upcoming day. At the top, you'll see a greeting, with a weather forecast and and any upcoming events on your calendar. Below that, there will be a list of reminders pulled from Gmail, Keep and other Google apps. If you keep scrolling, you'll also find recommended articles and videos from YouTube. Sam Rutherford for Engadget For those who also want to reflect at the end of their day, there's a new Journal app too. It has AI features built throughout. For instance, as you're writing an entry, it will automatically suggest images to include from your photo library. Additionally, the app will attempt to automatically categorize your entries based on topics you've designated. Google has used emoji for this part of the interface, which make it easy to see at a glance what you wrote about from the app's monthly view. Over in Photos, Google has introduced a feature called Conversational Editing. It allows you to tweak an image by describing to your phone how you want it modified. For example, say you took a selfie of yourself in a busy tourist location. You can tell Photos — using your voice, your phone's on-screen keyboard or a suggested prompt — to edit all the strangers out of the scene. After a few moments, the on-device model will produce a new image, with the original displayed alongside it so you can compare the two. It's possible to build multiple edits on top of one another, and if you don't like the latest edit, you can go back. Sam Rutherford for Engadget In the camera app, there are a handful of new AI features . First, there's Camera Coach, which will examine the shot you're about to snap. It will read the scene and make suggestions on the angle and lighting to use, as well what capture mode is best for the situation. Another new AI feature, dubbed Auto Best Take, finds and combines similar photos so that everyone in a group shot looks their best. Lastly, Google updated last year's Add Me feature to make it easier to include the photographer in even larger groups. Elsewhere, Google is introducing a few upgrades to its Gemini Live visual assistant that build on the base the company debuted last year. To start, there are new visual indicators that will mask part of your phone's screen to make it easier to see what Gemini is referring to when it answers a question. This feature will be available first on Pixel 10 devices before rolling out to other Android phones and iOS devices later. Separately, Google says it will soon release a new model that \"dramatically\" improves how Gemini uses key elements of human speech. For instance, you'll be able to tell the assistant to speak slowly if you're jotting down notes, and it will change its tone depending on the emotional nature of the topic you're discussing. The Pixel 10 family is available to per-order today , with general availability of the Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro XL to follow on August 28. The Pixel 10 Pro Fold , Pixel Watch 4 and Pixel Buds 2a won't arrive at retail until October 9.

The new generation flagship devices carry packed spec sheets with impressive upgrades from the Pixel 9 Pro . Perhaps the most exciting among them is the addition of Pixelsnap , which supports Google's new ecosystem of Qi2-compatible chargers that magnetically align to the back of the phone. Beyond just the convenience, Qi2 compatibility should offer faster wireless charging speeds, too. This functionality had been conspicuously missing from flagship Android devices until now, and spawns a whole new world of accessories that can snap onto the back of the Pixel. Google's flagship phones have long been known for delivering excellent photos, and these new Pixel's continue that tradition. Both models carry a triple rear camera system with a 50MP wide lens, a 48MP ultrawide with macro, and an “upgraded” 48MP 5x telephoto lens. It’s not clear yet what’s new about that telephoto camera, as it has the same f/2.8 aperture and 22-degree field of view as the one on the Pixel 9 Pro series. ProRes support is standard for more serious photo editors. The 6.3-inch Pixel 10 Pro and the 6.8-inch Pixel 10 Pro XL will both feature a Super Actua display with variable refresh rate up to 120 Hz. The displays offer up to 3,300 nits of peak brightness or 2,200 nits peak in HDR, about ten percent brighter than on the Pixel 9 Pro series. Both models boast their largest batteries yet with over 30 hours of battery life, which represents a roughly 25 percent boost over the last generation. The Pixel 10 Pro supports 30W fast charging while the Pro XL supports 45W. While both phones support the Qi2 standard, the 10 Pro XL is the first phone to support Qi2.2 with 25W wireless charging. The standard 10 Pro is limited to 15W wireless charging. Both sizes will be sold with 16GB of RAM. The Pro and Pro XL will both sport the Google Tensor G5 chip, which powers new on-board AI features coming to the entire Pixel 10 lineup. Key among them is Magic Cue, which can provide relevant information to the user by understanding when it's needed, like pulling up your flight info when you're calling the airline. Camera Coach is another AI-powered feature that will help users take better photographs by helping them find the best angle or lighting. Both sizes will be available in four color choices, those being Moonstone, Jade, Porcelain and Obsidian. The Pixel 10 Pro will launch at $999 for the 128GB model, and the Pixel 10 Pro XL will launch at $1,199 with 256GB of storage (double what the Pixel 9 Pro XL included). The new Pixel Pro line is available for pre-orders today and will hit shelves on August 28.

The upcoming smartwatch features a newly-designed domed display that's ten percent larger than the Pixel Watch 3's screen. It can also reach 3,000 nits of brightness. The battery life is impressive here, with the company saying it should last up to 40 hours per charge. That's enough time to use the watch all day and night, for those who want to track their sleep every once in a while. It also offers 25 percent faster charging when compared to the previous model. Google The Pixel Watch 4 gives customers access to SOS satellite communications, which lets users connect to emergency services via the device. This works even when cellular and Wi-Fi coverage isn't available. The feature first launched with the Pixel 9 series of smartphones . It's the first smartwatch by Google \"designed with serviceability in mind.\" This means that it's easier to replace the battery and screen. The Pixel Watch 4 tracks over 40 exercises, including yoga and kickboxing. There's an AI-based personal fitness coach that arrives first for Fitbit Premium users after the watch launches. As for health metrics, the smartwatch has an ECG app and offers irregular heart rhythm notifications. There's also a brand-new feature that detects when a heart stops beating, which automatically connects users to emergency services. All health metrics can be tracked via an integrated dashboard. Google Of course, the watch was designed with Google Gemini in mind. There's a new speaker for communication and a raise-to-talk functionality. The company says that Gemini will leverage data \"from apps across your device\" to answer questions. The Pixel Watch 4 comes in two sizes (41mm and 45mm) and integrates with a full range of accessories, including various bands. The company is introducing new watch faces and changed up the design of some pre-existing watch faces. It'll be available for purchase on October 9, with prices starting at $349.

This latest foldable offers some novel features, especially when compared to rival handsets like the recently-released Galaxy Z Fold 7 . The Pixel 10 Pro Fold offers an IP68 rating for dust and water resistance. This is pretty significant for dust, as the Z Fold 7 has just an IP48 rating. IP68 is a good rating and essentially means that the unit will be completely dustproof and can withstand being submerged in water deeper than one meter for around 30 minutes. The Pixel 9 Pro Fold offered an IPX8 rating, which is the same metric for water but a much poorer rating for dust. The Pixel 10 Pro Fold also includes Qi2 wireless charging, and it's the first foldable to offer this feature. That'll pair nicely with Google's just-announced PixelSnap platform, which is the company's answer to Apple's MagSafe. Google The general specs are solid here. It ships with a 6.4-inch external OLED display and an 8-inch internal display when unfolded. The hinge is made from high-grade aluminum alloy and the external display features a Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 cover. The battery lasts for around 24 hours, but Google's Extreme Battery Saver software can extend that all the way up to 84 hours. We'll have to test that when we run the handset through its paces. It can also charge up to 50 percent in just 30 minutes. There's a triple rear camera system, including a 48MP wide lens, a 10.5MP ultrawide lens with macro focus and a 10.8MP telephoto lens. It ships with a Google Tensor G5 chip, 16GB of RAM and up to 1TB in storage. The bad news? The Pixel 10 Pro Fold won't be available until October 9, while the other Pixel phones drop on August 29. Like most foldables, this handset is on the expensive side. Prices start at $1,799.

A preview of it will begin rolling out in October as part of the Fitbit app to Premium users in the US. The app is also getting a redesign which the company says will be “available with the latest Fitbit trackers, Fitbit smart watches and Pixel watches.” The first thing Fitbit users may notice is a visual refresh. In place of the current organization system, the bottom of the screen will feature four tabs: Today, Fitness, Sleep and Health. The home page (Today) will still feature daily progress stats in the form of bars and rings at the top, though these are now customizable so you can display your favorite metrics there. Below this is a feed of your upcoming workouts, recent activity and progress reports served in individual cards that you can tap into for more information. This layout, with data visualizations at the top and a feed that follows, is the same across all four tabs. Google At a recent demo, the company’s director of product management for Fitbit and health Andy Abramson showed us how his app surfaced his weekly cardio load in a ring, with bars to its right for his steps, readiness and sleep performance. “We call these our focus metrics,” he said. These are in a color scheme that will be familiar to Fitbit users, with purple continuing to be the color representing sleep data and teal for steps. But there’s a few more updates that Google says “address common user suggestions,” and these include easier layouts, more intuitive data visualization, “improved syncing — and of course, dark mode.” Google didn’t just give the Fitbit app a makeover. It said that coaching and AI were at the core of the redesign, and that the “entire app was rebuilt so the health coach can understand your goals, build your plan, contextualize your metrics and bring insights at the right moments.” Abramson said that his team sought to figure out “How do we put the AI coach in every part of the app?” Instead of simply tucking the AI features into a dedicated tab, “We actually need to tie it together.” To that end, a floating “Ask Coach” button is on every page of the app at the bottom right, and tapping it will take you into a conversation window with the Gemini-powered AI. This button is accessible across all the tabs in the updated app, and you can ask it questions about all the data you’ve provided to Fitbit. On your first time using the new app, you’ll be prompted to have a conversation with the AI coach, where it will ask about your goals, available equipment and any preferences, injuries or other relevant medical history. Those will go into an area called “Coach Notes,” that you can access in the Health tab and see what the app knows about you. There, you can delete things you don’t want in there any more. Cherlynn Low for Engadget If you only have a few free weights and a rowing machine, for example, the coach can build a custom plan that suggests a variety of weights-based exercises interspersed with sessions on your rower. But if you tell it at any point that you might be looking to incorporate outdoor runs into your routine, it can do so. Abramson told the app he wanted to get better at trail runs, for example, and in the version of the app I saw, that guidance affected a lot of the recommendations he was served. As he had told it he was traveling and had access to a hotel gym, it also suggested some activities on the facility’s Peloton bike. In future versions of the AI coach, you might be able to integrate with Gemini Live and point your camera around your (or your hotel’s) gym to get the system to identify what equipment is available and generate suggestions based on that. For now, all input to the app is limited to text, which means you may still need to know the difference between a barbell, a Y-bell and a dumbbell. The coach will build programs based on the info you supply, and these will come with detailed instructions and “metric targets that focus on weekly progression.” If you’re familiar with the cardio load and readiness score features that Google and Fitbit have rolled out in recent years, it’s easy to see how the concept has been developing over time. Your activity progress should not be judged on a daily basis — too many variables could affect whether you were able to get in a run or 10,000 steps on any given day. Instead, a more forgiving and holistic approach would be to consider weekly movement. If, like me, you tend to get in two cardio days, two strength days and one HIIT day a week, you won’t be penalized for not getting cardio in on a weights day. Or say you put in too many hours at work one day, writing a long article late into the night. The AI coach will recognize that you didn’t get as much sleep as usual and adjust your target cardio load accordingly. Google said the coach will make “real-time check-ins and adjustments” and that if you let the system know you’ve hurt your back, it will give you tips on how to modify your workouts. Google Part of the update to the Fitbit app includes new sleep algorithms that Google says make it more accurate, providing “a more precise understanding of your sleep duration and stages.” The coach also guides you to get better sleep, by studying your patterns over the week and sharing insights on how to improve things over time. If it notices that on weekdays you take a longer time than usual to fall asleep, for example, it might recommend heading to bed or turning off your devices earlier. If it thinks you might be jetlagged, it could suggest sleep schedules to help you re-adjust to new timezones. Finally, the sleep coach might look at your energy expenditure each day and recommend a bedtime that could get you 30 minutes of extra rest to get over a particularly grueling workout you undertook that morning. In time, the Fitbit coach will get data from a variety of sources, as it will support Health Connect and HealthKit to get things like your glucose levels or your weight and body composition from your smart scale or other connected devices. Google also says that in addition to helping you get personalized insights based on your activity and rest, its AI coach can help make sense of an overwhelming amount of data noise. That’s not just the information overload from all the different metrics your wearable might collect, but also the fact that there is a ton of content out there today that Google says is “written for everyone in general and no one in particular.” Since it has access to a wealth of data about you and a gigantic knowledge base from the internet, the coach can filter out noise to give you pertinent answers to your questions. You can ask things like “I’m feeling stressed right now. What can I do?” or “What are the best exercises for weight loss” and, according to Google, “get truly personalized answers that are backed by science.” The system will also serve up timely and regular reports on your performance and any trends or changes. Using AI to make sense of the overwhelming amount of data collected by our wearables seems like a smart approach, but it’s not without its drawbacks or concerns. Will your sensitive information be safely guarded? What type of information will the AI Coach serve and how trustworthy is that guidance? Google Google appears to be attempting to get ahead of those concerns, saying it is “committed to building our personal health coach with leading industry experts and through scientific research.” It’s partnered with Stephen Curry “and his performance team,” and is “working closely with our Consumer Health Advisory Panel, a diverse group of leading experts in medicine, AI and behavioral science.” I think it’s imperative that Google state very clearly that its AI Coach can not replace a doctor, a registered dietitian or a certified coach, and that it has guardrails in place to prevent aggressively pushing a person towards dangerous outcomes. The good news is, Google is well aware that it will have work to do, and is clear that it is “releasing this experience as a preview so you can help shape it as we make regular improvements.” For now, the AI is designed to help with fitness and sleep insights and recommendations, though it’s worth noting that Fitbit has historically considered a broader range of areas including mental health and menstrual cycles as essential components of overall wellbeing. In future, the AI Coach may also cover those types of data. If you’re keen to test the redesigned Fitbit app and new personal health coach out, you’ll have to be a Fitbit Premium subscriber, be based in the US and sign up to get notified when the preview is available in October.

This year, alongside a new Tensor G5 chip, the company has included some upgrades that might make the base model the star of the family. The standard Pixel 10: Now with a dedicated zoom for the first time Aside from updated color options (obsidian, indigo, frost and lemongrass), the standard Pixel 10 doesn't look too much different from last year's phone. It still has a matte aluminum frame and a 6.3-inch OLED screen with a 120Hz refresh rate. For 2025, Google has upped the brightness of its Actua display to a peak of 3,000 nits (up from 2,700 nits). Google also claims the Pixel 10's speakers have been significantly improved, though it was hard to tell by how much during my demo. Inside, changes to the Pixel 10's specs are a bit more robust. The Tensor G5 features a CPU that's 34 percent better year-over-year on top of a new TPU that's 60 percent faster than before. Memory and storage are staying the same at 12GB of RAM and either 128GB or 256GB of storage, though it's important to note that battery capacity has increased to 4,970mAh (up from 4,700mAh). That latter figure is even more than what you get from the Pixel 10 Pro (4,870mAh). But by far, the biggest upgrade on the standard Pixel 10 is a new 10.8MP camera with a 5x optical zoom, joining the existing 48MP main and 13MP ultrawide cams. This is the first time Google has ever put a dedicated zoom lens on a base Pixel, which is a huge value add because previously anyone who wanted a telephoto camera had to pay extra for one of the premium models. And based on what I saw in person and its specs, its telephoto camera appears to be similar to what we got in last year's Pixel 9 Pro Fold, so even if it's not quite as powerful as what's available on the Pixel 10 Pros, it's still a great addition to the base model. Furthermore, when compared to the standard Galaxy S25 , the Pixel 10 suddenly has a significant hardware advantage thanks to a bigger battery (just 4,000 mAh on the Samsung), a longer zoom (5x vs 3x) and slightly faster wired charging (up to 30 watts on the Pixel instead of just 25W). Plus, both phones come with the same seven years of Android updates and security patches. Sam Rutherford for Engadget That said, it remains to be seen if the Tensor G5 can match the general overall performance of the Snapdragon 8 Elite chips used in Samsung phones. That has always been a shortcoming of Google's homegrown silicon. But for pretty much everything else, the base Pixel 10 is looking like a much more complete device and a great option for anyone looking to save some money, since its price is staying the same at $799. Pixel 10 Pro and Pro XL: Even better specs and some Pro-only camera tricks As for the $999 Pixel 10 Pro and $1,199 Pro XL, like their smaller sibling, their appearance hasn't changed too much. The easiest way to tell them apart from the base model is that the Pros have a shiny frame instead of matte and slightly different colors: obsidian, moonstone, porcelain and jade. Their 6.3- and 6.8-inch Super Actua displays have gotten a similar bump in brightness up to 3,300 nits (up from 3,000 nits), while memory and storage have received a boost as well, up to 16GB of RAM and as much as 1TB of storage. Unfortunately, even though the Pixel 10 Pro XL now supports wired charging at up to 45 watts, the 10 Pro remains capped at 30. Sam Rutherford for Engadget Of course, with the base Pixel 10 getting a new zoom lens, Google couldn't forget about the Pro models. The Pixel 10 Pro and Pro XL's cameras have the same resolution as before: a 50MP main, 48MP ultra-wide and a 48MP telephoto with 5x optical zoom. However, Google has made some tweaks that include a new ISP, an improved optical image stabilization system and some additional tools like the ability to shoot portrait mode shots in full resolution, a first for the Pixel family. However, my favorite new feature here is Pro Res Zoom, an upgraded version of Super Res Zoom that can capture long-distance shots at up to 100x while using machine learning to fill in the gaps. Google says its algorithm pays special attention to things like people's faces, so hopefully we don't run into any AI slop. From what I've seen, Pro Res Zoom works remarkably well, especially when you consider that everything is happening on-device instead of sending images to the cloud for additional processing. Seeing this kind of sharpness at up to 100x from a 5x optical zoom is damn impressive, even if the Pixel is getting an assist from AI. New software, camera and AI features Sam Rutherford for Engadget Naturally, this wouldn't be a Pixel launch without a bunch of new software and AI-powered tricks. Sadly, there are so many new tools that I didn't have a chance to do a deep dive into all of them. The feature with the most potential might be Magic Cue, which uses AI to surface helpful information like addresses, reservations and more directly inside some of your most commonly used apps like Google Messages and Gmail. These prompts appear as little rainbow bubbles and you can tap on them to quickly send relevant info to others. When dealing with a flight, Magic Cue can call the related airline for you. Meanwhile, Google's Daily Hub functions a lot like Samsung's Now Brief feature, which puts handy reminders, calendar appointments and more all in a single place. This gives you a quick overview of important things happening each day. Alternatively, if you want to be a bit more introspective, the Pixel Journal feature is essentially a digital diary that's meant to help you reflect on important events or surface new topics that may be relevant to your interests. Elsewhere, there's a new on-the-fly translation feature that can mimic the sound of your own voice during calls. Gemini Live is also getting a visual overlay so it can better highlight things on your screen and clearly point out what it sees. And then there's Take a Message, which is kind of like Call Screener but for missed calls. For photography, Google showed off the ability to use natural language voice commands to edit images or add completely new elements to a pic (like putting sunglasses on an alpaca). Best Take has also been improved to analyze up to 150 frames before you even hit the shutter in group shots, allowing the phone to pick out an image where everyone is smiling. But if that doesn't happen, it can use AI to create a composite photo with the best expressions across a series of shots. Also, across the Pixel 10 line, Google is supporting the C2PA standard , so that there will be no guessing which images have been made or tweaked with AI and which ones are all natural (at least for things created in first-party apps). And finally, launching as a preview later this fall, there's a new Camera Coach tool that uses AI to help you frame your shots, improve your composition or even suggest some new angles and ideas (Google calls it Get Inspired). The feature offers step-by-step instructions on how to recreate a specific shot. Pixelsnap: Finally, official Qi2 support from a major Android phone maker Sam Rutherford for Engadget The last major upgrade is the addition of proper Qi2 wireless charging support. Google is calling this Pixelsnap, but it's based on the same underlying spec used in iPhones and other Qi2-compatible devices and it will be available on the entire Pixel 10 family. The one quirk is that while the Pixel 10 Pro XL can wirelessly charge at up to 25 watts, the base Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro are still limited to just 15 watts. On top of that, Google will have a handful of Pixelsnap accessories, including a charging mount with a removable Pixelsnap puck, a magnetic ring stand and more. Regardless, after major Android phone makers failed to add Qi2 support to last year's flagships , I'm glad Google is finally coming around, even if it took longer than I'd like. Not only does this open up the Pixel 10 line to the wide world of magnetic accessories, with a big name like Google hopping on the trend, it puts more pressure on companies like Samsung to properly adopt the standard instead of its devices being merely \" Qi2 ready \" (aka, Qi2 but without a built-in magnetic mounting point). Early thoughts Sam Rutherford for Engadget All told, I really like what Google is doing with the Pixel 10 line. The addition of a proper zoom camera on the base model is a blessing for people who might not want to pay the $200 premium for the Pro versions. It’s also great because I think the matte finish on the standard Pixel 10 looks better than the polished frame on the Pixel 10 Pro. And that goes double for the indigo variant, which is a callback to the original deep blue hue we saw back on the first Pixel from 2016. As a fan of long-distance photography, I really like the addition of Pro Res Zoom, though I do want to test it some more to see the limits of Google's AI magnification. It kind of bugs me that the Pixel 10 Pro XL has faster wired and wireless charging, as those specs really ought to be the same across both Pro models. And while the Tensor G5 seems to be much speedier than any of Google's previous chips, I'm very curious as to how much better it'll feel in the real world, particularly for stuff like gaming. But as a whole, the Pixel 10 family is shaping up to be some of the most well-rounded smartphones Google has ever made. The Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro XL are available for pre-order today starting at $799, $999 and $1,199 with official sales beginning on August 27.

Google announced the Pixel Buds 2a ($130) today alongside its slate of Pixel 10 phones, marking the first time the company's so-called A-Series earbuds have come equipped with ANC. Google also took design cues from its pricier Pixel Buds Pro 2 while outfitting this new model with a Tensor A1 chip. Sadly, all of the upgrades come with a price increase as the Pixel Buds 2a are $30 more than the previous version. For the 2a's design overhaul, Google ditched the \"stabilizer arc\" for the \"twist-to-adjust stabilizer\" from the Pixel Buds Pro 2. Like before, the company promises this element allows you to have both a secure and a more relaxed fit on the same earbuds simply by rotating them one way or the other. In terms of overall size, the Pixel Buds 2a are the lightest and smallest A-Series earbuds thus far. What's more, this new version is IP54 rated for dust and water resistance (buds only), which is an improvement over the A-Series' IPX4 rating. The charging case didn't have any ingress protection previously, but it's now IPX4. The biggest update on the Pixel Buds 2a is the addition of ANC that's paired with Google's Silent Seal 1.5. As you might expect, transparency mode is available when you need to tune in to your surroundings. That ANC should help you to hear the retooled acoustics and 11mm dynamic drivers better, including spatial audio and customized sound via a 5-band EQ. The Tensor A1 chip is the component that's in the Pixel Buds Pro 2. Here, it provides improved performance across audio and calls. Google says the chip processes audio 90 times faster than the speed of sound, adapting to changes in your environment to cancel noisy distractions. Plus, the Tensor A1 allows you to use Gemini and other AI features with the Pixel Buds 2a. Google doubled the battery life on this new model compared to the Pixel Buds A-Series. You can now expect up to 10 hours of use on the earbuds with another 17 hours in the case. With ANC enabled, those figures drop to seven hours and 13 hours, respectively. So even with noise cancellation turned on, battery life on the Pixel Buds 2a is still better than the previous model. The Pixel Buds 2a are available for pre-order starting today for $130. General availability is scheduled for October 9 and you can choose between Hazel (pictured) and Iris color options.

The camera bar on the standard Pixel 10 includes a 5x telephoto lens, a first for the series. Qi2 charging also comes to the series with Google's MagSafe-like Pixelsnap accessory ecosystem. The $799 handset is powered by the Tensor G5 chip, which powers new on-device AI features. Google says the Pixel 10's 48 MP 5x telephoto lens can produce 10x optical image quality. However, that's using a combination of optical zoom, cropping and computational photography. If you want pure optical zoom, 5x is all you get. Google's Super Res Zoom (combining multiple frames to enhance detail) takes it up to a 20x zoom equivalent. If you don't mind leaning on its digital trickery, the phone could be a solid choice for concert or wildlife photography. The zoom lens is joined by 48 MP wide and 13 MP ultrawide lenses. On the front is a 10.5 MP selfie camera. Google All Pixel 10 phones have built-in Qi2 wireless charging . This finally brings MagSafe-like capabilities to Android flagships, five years after Apple added it to the iPhone . (The Galaxy S25 series supports Qi2 but without built-in magnets .) Google is launching an array of magnetic accessories, dubbed Pixelsnap. This includes $50 Pixel 10 cases, a $40 charging puck, a $70 charging stand and a $30 (non-charging) ring stand. Google says the Pixel 10's battery will last longer than the Pixel 9's. The company rates the new model for 30+ hours of use. (Last year's Pixels were rated for 24+ hours.) The Pixel 10 can also charge to 55 percent in 30 minutes when using a 30W adapter. Under the hood is Google's Tensor G5 chip, which powers all of the Pixel 10 series. The company says its CPU is 34 percent faster than the Tensor G4. The phone has 12GB of RAM and 128GB / 256GB storage tiers, the same as the Pixel 9. Google The Tensor G5 powers a new on-device AI feature called Magic Cue, which offers proactive suggestions. Google says Magic Cue can bring up your flight details when you call your airline. Or, it can pull up your Airbnb address when a friend asks for it. This aligns with the AI as a context-sensitive concierge approach that device makers are moving toward. Meanwhile, Camera Coach falls into the automate everything, no skill required category of AI. When you aim the camera, the feature uses Gemini models to analyze the scene. It then provides framing and composition suggestions. It can also recommend the best camera modes to use. Google There are plenty more AI features onboard. There's a new audio model for Gemini Live . It's said to detect your emotion and control the assistant's emotional tone. (It sounds a bit creepy in theory, but we'll reserve judgment until we try it.) Then there's Pixel Journal, a private app with AI-generated prompts for recording thoughts. (It's launching first in Europe and English.) Finally, Voice Translate brings Google Meet's live translation feature to your phone calls. It translates calls to other languages in real time, simulating the users' voices. Wild stuff. The Pixel 10 has a satin metal finish (\"spacecraft-grade aluminum\") with Gorilla Glass Victus 2. The phone has an IP68 rating for dust and water resistance. The Google Pixel 10 arrives on August 28. It starts at $799 for 128GB storage. You can order it in obsidian, frost, lemongrass and indigo colors.

Compared to the Pixel 9's dramatic camera bump , however, this year's improvements are mainly iterative. The base model got the biggest hardware update with the addition of a third camera. Otherwise, Google focused mainly on AI processing this time, particularly with a new feature designed to help users improve their photos and Gemini AI addition that lets you edit photos using only your voice. For better or worse, a lot of Google's camera enhancements are on the AI side. A key new update is the Gemini AI-powered Camera Coach that aims to help users with photo composition. When enabled, it can read the scene and offer advice for the angle and lighting and even suggest the best mode (Portrait, Night Sight, etc.). Another new AI mode called Auto Best Take finds and combines similar photos into one so everyone in a group shot looks their best. And Google updated the \"Add Me\" feature from last year so you can include the photographer in even bigger groups. Google Google is also using AI to make it easier to edit Pixel 10 images The editor inside Google Photos now provides AI-powered suggestions that combine multiple effects for quick edits, even if you know nothing about photo touchups. Simply ask for a specific edit like \"remove the cars in the background\" or \"restore this old photo.\" The AI will understand the change you're trying to make and use all the tools available to automatically do so. You can then add follow-up instructions for further improvements. Finally, all Pixel 10 models have an updated Portrait mode that offers \"improved segmentation, detail, sharpness, and texture,\" so that photos shot in that mode look less, well, AI generated. The base Pixel devices have played second fiddle to the Pro models in the past. However, the Pixel 10 now has a triple-camera system just like the other models, thanks to the addition of a 10.8MP 5x telephoto lens. That boosts the maximum digital Super Res Zoom up to 20x, double that of the Pixel 9. It's worth noting that a 5x optical zoom is rare on a base model camera — the Galaxy S25 has just a 3x lens, for instance. The other two are a 48MP wide (main) camera with macro focus, compared to a 50MP version before, along with a 13MP ultra-wide. Unfortunately, the latter is a downgrade in terms of resolution from the 48MP ultra-wide shooter on the previous model. Google is promising optical quality at 0.6x, 1x, 5x and 10x zoom levels. The 10.5MP ultra-wide selfie camera with a 95-degree field of view is the same mediocre one as before, though. Google Hardware-wise, the triple-camera systems on the Pixel 10 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro XL models are unchanged in terms of resolution. Both have 50MP wide, 48MP ultra-wide with macro focus and 48MP 5x telephoto lenses, along with 42MP ultra-wide selfie cameras as before. One new feature on both models is the \"Pro Res Zoom\" optimized for the Tensor G5 chip that goes up to 100x, compared to 20x on the Pixel 9 Pro and Pro XL. Since that zoom is digitally enhanced, however, you may see some wonky artifacts. One other change is double the stabilization on the wide camera that's supposed to provide more cinematic footage, according to Google. Not much has changed on the video side, with 8K available on the Pro models only via the Video Boost feature that digitally upscales footage from 4K. Finally, the Pixel 10 Fold has a similar setup to the Pixel 10, with a 48MP wide camera, 10.5MP ultra-wide camera and 10.8MP telephoto with 5x optical zoom. The front and inner cameras are both 10MP f/2.2 models. Sam Rutherford for Engadget Pixel 10 devices will also be the first to implement C2PA content credentials within the native camera app, whether they were created with or without AI. As a reminder, C2PA (Content Provenance and Authenticity) is a standard being used by Meta , Google and others to detect and label changes made by AI. Another key AI accessibility feature called Guided Frame describes what the camera is seeing for blind and low vision users. Finally, it's worth calling out the new Actua 360 display available on all models, particularly the 50 percent extra brightness (up to 3,000 nits peak). That makes photography easier on sunny days as you can better see details in your composition. In sum, it's good to see the Pixel 10 getting some love on the photo side with a triple camera system that matches or beats its competition. The Pixel 10 Pro models are mostly unchanged, however, removing some incentive to upgrade rom the Pixel 9 Pro — though the new AI features look more promising than usual. In any case, you'll get the full picture of the Pixel 10 lineup's cameras with Engadget's upcoming reviews.

Google has announced several updates for the Pixel Buds Pro 2 as well. Perhaps the most visible change is that the earbuds are available in a new gray colorway called Moonstone. This is perhaps designed with those who like to match the colors of their earbuds and phone in mind, as you can snap up a Pixel 10 in Moonstone as well. Pre-orders for the Pixel Buds Pro 2 in Moonstone open today. In addition, several new features are coming to Pixel Buds Pro 2 in September via a software update. One that's called Loud Noise Protection will automatically dampen the volume of sudden loud noises while you're wearing the earbuds to help protect your hearing. It could work for things like a train passing while you're waiting at a station, but Google says that the feature is \"not suitable to safeguard against sharp, sudden impulse sounds, such as gunshots, explosions or fireworks.\" On a similar note, Adaptive Audio will automatically adjust the volume based on how noisy your physical environment is. Google says it could help to drown out distractions in loud environments so you can better hear what you're listening to, all the while helping make sure you're aware of what's going on around you. You'll soon be able to answer calls using head gestures. With the help of the accelerometer other sensors, the earbuds will be able to detect when you nod or shake your head, and you can use this movement to answer or decline calls and respond to texts. Also coming in September is advanced audio processing for Gemini Live. Google says that, when you're using the AI voice assistant on a compatible Android device (and in a supported language and country), Pixel Buds Pro 2 will be able to eliminate background noise and prioritize your voice so Gemini Live can pick up what you're saying more clearly.

Not only did Google switch to a simpler design while adding a larger main display, the company caught up to Samsung's long-running foldable line in just two generations . However, for its third go — the Pixel 10 Pro Fold — Google is opting for a different strategy than we’ve seen recently on the Galaxy Z Fold 7 . Instead of focusing on thinness, Google may have just created the most rugged foldable on the market. That’s due in large part to the phone’s new IP68 rating. Now I will admit that certification might not sound like a huge deal because non-flexy flagships have had this kind of durability for years. But this is the first time any foldable has put both top-tier dust and water resistance together in one device. And when you consider that these kinds of gadgets are generally a bit more fragile than their glass-brick counterparts, that means something. Furthermore, Google says the Pixel 10 Pro Fold’s (P10PF from here on out) 8-inch Super Actua Flex display features a new titanium backplate that adds extra rigidity while a more robust layer of ultra-thin glass provides increased scratch resistance. On the outside, Google went with Gorilla Glass Victus 2 in front and back while installing a new gearless hinge the company claims is designed to handle more than 10 years of bending. Then to top things off, Google equipped the P10PF with a larger 5,015mAh battery, which is a significant jump up from the 4,650mAh cell in its predecessor. Even with all these improvements, the P10PF’s overall dimensions are almost exactly the same as the previous model. Between its weight (9.1 ounces) and thickness (10.8mm folded) though, Google’s foldable is still rather chunky compared Samsung’s newly streamlined Z Fold 7 (8.9mm and 7.5 ounces). Following the major redesign we got last year on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, getting another all-new, super sleek chassis for the P10PF probably wasn’t going to happen. But given the increased durability on this year’s phone, I’m willing to give Google another 12 months to combine this newfound ruggedness with a thinner design. I just hope its engineers don’t get complacent and push things out further than that. Sam Rutherford for Engadget On the inside, the P10PF also boasts upgraded specs and performance with its Tensor G5 chip leading the way. According to Google, its CPU features 34 percent better performance while its TPU fares even better with a 60 percent jump over what we got from the Tensor G4. And just like the rest of the Pixel 10 family, the P10PF supports Google’s Pixelsnap magnetic charging ecosystem, which is fully compatible with the Qi2 protocol. So not only is the Pixel 10 line the first batch of phones from a major Android OEM to support Qi2, the P10PF is also the first foldable phone with this industry standard. Wired charging speeds have increased slightly to 30 watts, but unfortunately wireless charging is staying pat at 15W. Base memory is also staying the same at 16GB of RAM, though there is a wider range of storage options from 256GB to 1TB. Some other small details I appreciate are the P10PF’s slimmer bezels around the outside of its exterior display. It makes the curved corner in the top left look a lot less awkward and it allowed Google to increase its overall size a touch to 6.4 inches across (up from 6.3). On top of that, both of its displays are brighter too, topping out at 3,000 nits (up from 2,700 nits). Aside from updated software and AI tools like Magic Cue and the Daily Hub, all of which will be available across the Pixel 10 family, the P10PF is getting two notable foldable-specific upgrades. The first is enhanced drag and drop support that works in tandem with expanded split screen functionality to improve multitasking and moving files between apps. That said, as I was using demo devices that were essentially fresh out of the box, it was difficult to tell how much of an impact this may have on everyday use. The other addition is a new dual-pane layout for the P10PF’s camera app, which takes better advantage of the extra screen space you have when the phone is unfolded. This allows you to see new photos as soon as you snap them on the left while the viewfinder stays open on the right. The biggest potential shortcoming of the P10PF is that its camera hardware is largely staying the same. Granted, that's not a huge deal because the previous model had the best photo quality of any foldable phone. But sadly, because the P10PF doesn't have the same sensors as the Pixel 10 Pro and Pro XL, this means the P10PF also won’t have access to Google’s AI-powered 100x Pro Res Zoom or the ability to capture portrait shots in full resolution. Unfortunately, when I asked if these features would be ported to the P10PF in the future, a Google rep told me there are currently no concrete plans to do so. Here's how last year's Pixel 9 Pro Fold (left) compares in size to the new Pixel 10 Pro Fold (right). Sam Rutherford for Engadget In a lot of ways, it feels like Google is doing almost everything it can to improve the Pixel 10 Pro Fold without completely redesigning it with a thinner chassis. So if you’re the type of person who can handle a little extra junk in the trunk, there’s a lot to like about a foldable phone that comes with more robust durability. The Pixel 10 Pro Fold starts at $1,799 and is available for pre-order today in two colors: jade and moonstone. However, there will be a bit of delay until it actually arrives as official sales aren’t slated to start until October 9.

A surprising number of updates are coming to the Pixel Watch 4 , and I was impressed by how these changes add up to make it less of an iterative update than I initially expected. Of all its new features, I found the Pixel Watch 4’s satellite communications capability, repairable design and improved charging speeds most compelling. Other changes, like the brighter, curved display, dual-chip architecture, upgraded haptics engine and speaker as well as Wear OS 6 and other software features are less exciting, but will matter more to the day-to-day experience. The redesigned Fitbit app, which will have a new AI experience at its core, will also impact your daily use more. At first glance and from a recent hands-on, I’m intrigued by the Pixel Watch 4 and how the individual improvements might add up to a more meaningful overall experience. Satellite connectivity for emergency communications on a smartwatch I want to jump right into the new feature I’m most interested in: emergency satellite communications. Google says the Pixel Watch 4 is the first standalone commercial smartwatch to support this feature, and that probably largely has to do with the chip that powers it. The Snapdragon Wear 5 Gen 2, which Qualcomm announced today along with the Wear 5+ Gen 2, is the first wearable processor to offer satellite support, according to the company. It’ll use Skylo’s Narrowband Non-Terrestrial Network (NB-NTN) and allow for “two-way emergency messaging directly from the wearable device.” It’s worth noting that this will only work on LTE models and in the contiguous United States, though. In a recorded demo of the feature at a hands-on event, I saw what it would look like on a Pixel Watch 4 when you try to connect to a satellite to send a message. Now, to be extremely clear, this was a pre-recorded video that played on loop on the device. All I did was hit play and watch. Still, it was nice to get an idea of what the process would require. It looked like you’d need to follow onscreen instructions to move your wrist around while the system searched for an available satellite to connect to. It was reminiscent of existing versions on phones. Whether it’s ultimately reliable or effective is something I can’t say until I get to actually test it. Sam Rutherford for Engadget Improved charging dock and faster recharging In contrast, I did get to see for myself just how quickly the Pixel Watch 4 recharges. On paper, the company says the new watch can go from 0 to 50 percent charged in 15 minutes or less. I sat next to a Pixel Watch 4 for ten minutes as it sat on a charging dock, and saw it go from 70 percent to 90 percent in that time. That’s impressive, and though that math doesn’t appear to match what the company promised, there’s a fairly straightforward reason. A Google representative told me that past 80 percent, the charging changes from CC (constant current) to CV (constant voltage). Without getting too much into the technicalities of what’s happening , basically when CV kicks in, charging speeds slow down. This is a fairly standard battery optimization measure for most modern devices. If the Pixel Watch 4 were starting off closer to 0 percent, it’s possible that it would have recharged to 50 percent in 15 minutes, but I don’t know for certain. I’m also not sure whether the fact that the demo unit was connected to a portable battery instead of a wall socket made any difference in this case. I am, however, glad to see that it was able to get 20 percent of juice in just 10 minutes — just about the time it takes for me to get ready for the gym every morning. Google also redesigned the charging dock. Instead of a puck that sits under the watch (like you’ll find on almost all smartwatches today), the Pixel Watch 4 has a cradle that it can sit sideways in. The charger itself has a smaller footprint: instead of a round disc, it’s a rectangular dock about the size of a double A battery, with a groove in it to accommodate the watch. You can place the Pixel Watch 4 in there, knob side up with the screen facing either direction. When it’s connected, the watch will show the time and charge level and I could see that information from about six feet away. It’s basically the iPhone’s Standby mode but for a watch that’s propped up on its side. Sam Rutherford for Engadget I’m not sure how much easier it is to drop a watch sideways into a cradle as opposed to straight onto a disc, but I do think having the charge level be viewable from a distance is helpful. I’m also glad that Google spent time thinking about faster charging and making the device last longer, since those were complaints we had with previous models. To be specific, the company says the new smartwatch lasts 25 percent longer than its predecessor, thanks to a dual-chip architecture and efficiencies via Wear OS 6. New curved, brighter display Google says the Pixel Watch 4 has all new hardware on both the inside and out. In fact, it went as far as to say it completely redesigned the Pixel Watch and that this is the biggest update to the device yet. One of the most visible changes is the display. Not only is it 50 percent brighter than the one on the Pixel Watch 3, but the screen itself is domed this time, not just the glass at the top. I didn't really see a difference at first, but when looking a Pixel Watch 4 and 3 side-by-side, the new model was noticeably brighter, and watch faces seemed to stretch a bit closer to the edge of the case. Since the interface uses a black background, though, it was hard to tell whether the bezel was thinner. There are quite a few new features that I didn’t get to test, which I’ve collected in a list at the bottom of this article. For now, it’s probably more relevant to talk about things like Gemini on Wear OS 6, Raise to talk (to the assistant), the redesigned Fitbit app and the AI-powered updates. Raise to talk to Gemini and AI-generated message replies The Pixel Watch 4 isn’t the first watch to launch with Google’s latest wearable platform (that honor belongs to Samsung’s Galaxy Watch 8 series). But it does have an exclusive feature to make interacting with Gemini a bit easier: Raise to talk. Unlike on the Samsung wearable, where you have to verbally invoke the assistant or long press the knob on the side, on the Pixel Watch 4 you can bring your wrist to your face and Gemini will be ready for your requests. When it recognizes the gesture, the Pixel Watch 4 will show a small animated icon at the bottom of its screen to indicate it’s listening. But on my repeated attempts to trigger it, the system only registered that I had brought my wrist up about half of the time. Granted, I was using a watch that belonged to a Google representative and was a bit loose on my wrist, so the accuracy might improve with a better fit. I did notice other Google executives perform very deliberate movements to get the watch to listen and even then it seemed like Raise To Talk required multiple attempts to work. This is something I will have to wait till I get a unit in the real world to evaluate the efficacy of, but for now I am intrigued by the potential convenience but skeptical of the actual performance. Senior director of product management for Google Wearables Sandeep Waraich later explained that the system is currently tuned to recognize more deliberate movements as a way to avoid false positives. Waraich said that over time, and possibly by the time the Watch 4 is on shelves in October, the motion required to trigger Raise To Talk should require less exaggeration. When I did get Gemini to hear me, it responded fairly quickly to my question about activities to do in New York on a hot summer day. Again, I’d need more time with the device to judge how useful this would be in the real world. There was another feature that had much more potential to be helpful though: AI-generated quick replies to messages. I only saw a quick demo on a Google rep’s watch, but in response to a message saying “How’d the basketball game go?” the system suggested responses of “We won,” “We lost, but it was fun” and “It was great” with a basketball emoji. That’s much better than the canned prompts from before that were more likely to be “Yes,” “No,” “Call me later” or some other generic variant. It did take a second for them to load, though. A Google spokesperson at the event told us that this is possibly the first time an on-device language model has been deployed on a smartwatch, which might be noteworthy but it’s not anything that will materially impact the experience. I will say that while I didn’t get to dive too deeply into the rest of Wear OS 6 with Material 3 Expressive on the Pixel Watch 4, we do already have a review of the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 up and in it we cover some of the changes to the platform. On Google’s smartwatches, I liked how the new software made better use of space in things like the Weather and Search cards, with an improved balance between putting more information within one page while still retaining a generous size for buttons and text. Cherlynn Low for Engadget A closer look at the redesigned Fitbit app One of the places any Pixel Watch owner will be spending much of their time is the Fitbit app, where their collected health and fitness data will be presented. I spent some time with a preview version of the redesigned app, which will be available in October to Premium users in the US. Aesthetically, the app looks quite different, with a customizable dashboard of stats at the top of the main page (aka the Today tab). At the bottom are new tabs “Today,” “Fitness,” “Sleep” and “Health.” Though the font feels more reminiscent of recent Android and Material designs, existing Fitbit users will find the color scheme familiar. Purple is still what your sleep progress bar’s color is, while your steps are still shown in a teal bar. But below all those visual representations of data is a card with a prompt to chat with the new AI Coach, followed by what Google calls a “stream,” and a floating blue “Ask Coach” button at the bottom right. The stream is separated into Upcoming and “Your day so far” sections, with the latter populated by cards summarizing your progress on areas like sleep and fitness. In a small demo, Google's director of product management for Fitbit and Health Andy Abramson walked us through the new product. He showed us his app, where a card titled “Less sleep than usual last night” said he had about 4 hours and 28 minutes of estimated sleep. It summarized the amount of time awake and interruptions during that period, and then asked “Given the shorter duration, how are you feeling energetically this morning?” A card further down, titled “Your body is well-balanced today” and tagged “Readiness,” talked about Abramson’s readiness score, what it means and showed a chart on his performance this week. You can choose to continue conversations by tapping into each card, or simply ignore them and continue scrolling down the stream. Tapping through the tabs at the bottom brings you into similarly laid out pages with information specific to your activity, sleep and vitals (as measured by the wearable). That last one will show your heart rate, respiratory rate, blood oxygen and other stats, followed by sections called “Health areas,” “Detection and self screening” and “Personal info.” This presents a combination of information your fitness tracker collects, as well as data you enter. This all feeds into the new AI Coach, which will be a paid Fitbit Premium feature, that is meant to be your Gemini-powered “personal health coach.” It’s still a fairly new tool that’s going to be in limited preview as Google continues to assess its efficacy and evaluate necessary tweaks and guardrails, but at least it seems like the company is well aware of the potential pitfalls it might encounter in the development of any AI tool for health. In a press release announcing the new personal health coach and the Fitbit redesign, Google said “We’re committed to building our personal health coach with leading industry experts and through scientific research.” To that end, it’s partnering with Stephen Curry “and his performance team” and “also working closely with our Consumer Health Advisory Panel, a diverse group of leading experts in medicine, AI and behavioral science.” I remain skeptical of AI’s trustworthiness in general, but if there’s one thing Google and Fitbit have it’s an abundance of data from the years of experience they have in collecting health data from wearables. AI seems like a suitable method to make sense of the madness, as long as it’s done mindfully. And it does seem like the Pixel Watch and Fitbit teams are thinking carefully about their approach. I will need to wait till I get to use the new app and AI Coach on my own to see how personalized and useful it is, of course. Repairability plus a list of other updates coming to the Pixel Watch 4 There were quite a few other updates I didn’t get to test during my time with the Pixel Watch 4, including the AI-powered activity recognition system, improved sleep-tracking and overnight skin temperature-sensing, as well as the accuracy of the new dual-frequency GPS. I didn’t get to check out the feature that streams your bike workout stats to your phone in real time so you can see the details more easily when your device is mounted to your handlebar. I also didn’t go about measuring if the Watch 4’s vibrations were indeed 15 percent stronger than its predecessor’s, and I wasn’t able to verify if the speakers were clearer than before, either. In addition, I can’t vouch for the durability of the Pixel Watch 4, which is rated IP68 for dust- and water-resistance and has a custom Gorilla Glass covering and aluminum housing. I doubt I will be putting those ruggedness claims to the test, but it’s heartening to know there is a respectable level of protection here. Sam Rutherford for Engadget The good news is, even if you do manage to break the screen somehow, you won’t need to buy a new Pixel Watch 4. It has a repairable design that allows you to remove the display and battery in case those parts need to be replaced. Again, I didn’t break out my screwdriver and fix a Pixel Watch 4, but I did scrutinize the (very small) screws along the case in the groove where the straps attach to the device. Theoretically, though, I applaud the notion of repairable devices and am pleased to see Google take this approach. The Pixel Watch 4’s pricing, availability and value One more thing that’s laudable: The Pixel Watch 4’s price remains unchanged from the Pixel Watch 3. It starts at $349 for the 41mm Wi-Fi model, and you can get the larger size or LTE-connected variants for more money. The smartwatch is available for pre-order today, though it’ll only start shipping and be in stores on October 9. While I continue to recommend you wait till we can publish a full review before investing your hard-earned money on any device, I do think the list of improvements Google is bringing to the Pixel Watch series is a long, thoughtful and meaningful one. For a smartwatch that has faced its fair share of challenges across the generations, the Pixel Watch 4 finally feels like it’s both maturing and carving out a space for itself.

The company is reportedly prepping a higher-end tablet that'll run on Android. This device could come next year and will reportedly cost around $400. Amazon's Fire tablet software is itself a heavily modified version of Android, but the upcoming tablet will reportedly use the actual OS. This is great news for those who want easy integration with other Android devices. It's also great news for app developers. The primary downside of Fire OS is that it mandates the use of its own app store. The custom nature of the OS requires developers to make separate versions of apps for Amazon tablets. This has severely limited the store's variety, especially when compared to the Google Play Store or the Apple App Store. The downside to all of this is likely the aforementioned $400 price tag. Fire tablets are known for being inexpensive. The Fire Tablet 7 costs $60 and sales can bring that down even further. The company's most expensive tablet is currently the Fire Max 11 , which costs $230. Amazon has declined to comment on the matter and we don't have any information regarding specs of the upcoming tablet. Hopefully the price increase translates to much better internals. This isn't the first time the company has given up on a product that used a proprietary operating system. The Fire Phone was released back in 2014 but failed to win over consumers. Amazon stopped selling the device in 2015 .

The standard PS5 (the one with with a disc drive) will now run you $550, up from $500. The Digital Edition is $500, up from $450. The PS5 Pro , meanwhile, will require you to fork over a whopping $750. That’s up from an already-eyewatering $700. In other words, each console got a $50 price bump. Sony says it’s rolling out the price increases due to (you guessed it) market uncertainty. \"Similar to many global businesses, we continue to navigate a challenging economic environment,\" it said in a blog post . \"As a result, we’ve made the difficult decision to increase the recommended retail price for PlayStation 5 consoles in the US starting on August 21.\" The silver lining to this is that Sony isn't increasing the prices of accessories for the time being. \"We have no other price changes to announce for additional markets,\" the company added. The company bumped up PS5 prices in the UK, Europe and Australia in April. It increased PS Plus prices in several markets that same month. So, it seemed the US was unlikely to be spared price hikes for much longer. Normally by this point in a console’s lifecycle, we would have seen a price cut. But nope, nearly five years into this generation and those who haven’t snapped up a PS5 or Xbox Series X/S now face the prospect of having to shell out more money for the consoles. The same goes for the Nintendo Switch, but at this point you'd likely be better off with a Switch 2, which costs just $60 more.

Right now you can grab the officially licensed dock for $20, down from its regular price of $25. 8BitDo’s charging dock is compatible with the Xbox Series X|S and Xbox One variants of the Xbox Wireless Controller and uses magnetic contact charging to juice up your pad. It comes with a 1,100mAh battery pack and a battery door for each version of Microsoft's controller. Note that you get a USB-C cable included, but not a power adapter. Charging time is around three hours, and a light indicator tells you the status of your pad’s battery: It’s amber while charging, and white when the controller is fully charged. The Xbox Wireless Controller is one of the few modern pads that still ships with AA batteries out of the box. While they tend to last for a while, you’ll likely want to upgrade to a rechargeable alternative eventually, and 8BitDo’s currently discounted accessory ensures you’ll never have a flat controller again.

Yep, the company is claiming that Google Cloud AI can help the four-time NBA champ, two-time MVP and two-time scoring champion get even better at basketball. According to the company, AI insights can analyze his shot quality as well as sharpen his workout plans. Google's AI Basketball Coach experience, its AI experiment that turns Gemini into a jump shot coach with help from Pixel cameras, will also analyze his form and give him visual feedback. The basketball icon already tried out AI Basketball Coach during Curry Camp, his three-day basketball camp where he mentors 30 student athletes from across the US. \"Through interactive demos and challenges, the next generation of athletes learned how our technology can help them elevate their game,\" Google said. Curry's partnership with Google goes beyond using AI to make him even better at his sport, though. Google is officially calling him a \"Performance Advisor,\" and he and his team will actively work with the company's health experts and product and AI engineers to help shape the future of Google Health and upcoming Fitbit models. The athlete's team will be testing Google's personal health coach and giving the company feedback on how to improve its ability to create tailored advice for each individual. They will be using Pixel phones, watches and buds, as well. Their input, Google said, will be used to \"fine-tune products, train algorithms and design future product experiences.\" This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-says-steph-curry-will-use-its-ai-to-get-better-at-basketball-141532440.html?src=rss", "ingested_utc": "2025-08-20T14:45:26Z"}

Whether you've stumbled upon air fryers for health reasons , convenience or you're already a card-carrying member of the air fryer clan, a sale is a great time to pick one up. We selected the COSORI as the runner-up for best air fryer overall , and were impressed with its six-quart capacity despite its relatively small footprint on the kitchen counter. Our reviewers found the basket was super roomy enough to fit quite a few chicken wings and a whole block of tofu without too much crowding. With nine different preset cooking modes to work with, the COSORI is a true workhorse. It has a preheat mode for starting a cook at a precise temperature, a proof option for home bakers, a dedicated frozen setting and more, including standard broil, bake and roast modes. The COSORI has some creature comforts that we really appreciated too, like an easy-to-use touchscreen, a basket release button and an auto-pause feature that turns off the cooking element when you release the basket. The air fryer craze doesn’t look to die down any time soon, and if you haven’t jumped on the bandwagon, now might be the right time to do so.

During Gamescom 2025, ASUS revealed that the Xbox Ally handheld consoles will be on store shelves on October 16. We heard a thorough explanation of the specs and availability for the ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X this summer, but the arrival date is the only new info to come from the major gaming event in Cologne. There's still no price available for these handhelds, but we expect to receive that critical detail along with pre-order information some time in the coming weeks. For comparison, the 2024 ROG Ally X costs $800 while the simpler ROG Ally Gaming Console from 2023 costs $500. So if we were hazarding guesses, the ROG Xbox Ally might come in at a price tag around $650, while the spiffier ROG Xbox Ally X could be more in the ballpark of $900. The Official Xbox Podcast also included a segment about the upcoming handhelds, with a pair of Xbox execs talking about the devices and their experiences using them for titles like Tony Hawk's Pro Skater , Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 and Balatro . The chatter is unsurprisingly very positive about the hardware, but it might have enough tidbits to hold you over if you're super amped about getting your own hands on an Xbox Ally this fall.

It produced stunning aurora displays in parts of the US that are normally too far south to see them. Normally, such storms are a headache for energy providers. In 1989, for example, the Canadian province of Québec suffered a nine-hour blackout following a series of plasma ejections from the Sun. This time around, power companies were better prepared, and in the US and Canada, there weren't significant service disruptions. The episode highlighted the value of proper preparation against geomagnetic storms, and for the past couple of years, NASA and IBM have been working to give the scientific community and others a better way to predict solar weather. Today, they're releasing the result of their work, an open-source foundation model called Surya. Named after the Sanskrit word for the Sun, Juan Bernabe-Moreno, director of IBM Research Europe, UK and Ireland, describes the system as an \"AI telescope for the Sun.\" IBM trained the model on nine years of high-resolution images from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), a satellite NASA has been using to study the Sun since 2010. IBM Effectively, Surya applies machine learning to solar image interpretation and forecasting, and the results are promising. In early testing, Bernabe-Moreno says IBM found the model was 16 percent more accurate at answering the question \"will there be a solar flare in the next 24 hours?\" than past systems. Additionally, the model can generate visual predictions of what the SDO might see ahead of time. So far, using data from the most recently completed solar cycle , IBM has found Surya can accurately predict what the sun will look like two hours ahead of time. \"We’re exploring the accuracy of even longer lead time predictions,\" Bernabe-Moreno told me. Two hours might not seem like a lot, but according to Bernabe-Moreno, who previously worked at one of Europe's largest energy companies, it could be a game changer for infrastructure providers, which have spent the last few decades building more responsive power grids. Moreover, Surya is a 366 million parameter model, meaning it's light enough to run on less powerful hardware. The irony of today's announcement is that it demonstrates the value of NASA's science team exactly at a time when its very existence is threatened. If you haven't been following what's been going on at the agency, President Trump plans to cut NASA's science budget by nearly half . The Solar Dynamics Observatory would be among the missions affected by the proposed cuts. It won't be cancelled like New Horizons and OSIRIS-APEX, but according to an analysis by The Planetary Society , the mission would have its operating budget slashed from $14 million annually to $8 million per year. IBM Policymakers from both parties have pushed back on the proposal, but with the Senate and House not yet in agreement on the agency's 2026 operating budget, and the appropriations deadline quickly approaching, NASA's fate is uncertain. Even if the cuts don't go through, the agency is on track to lose close to 4,000 employees , or about 20 percent of its workforce, as part of the Trump administration's broader efforts to trim the number of workers across the federal government. Bernabe-Moreno says Surya wouldn't have come together without NASA's help. \"From the very beginning, the science team at NASA have been informing us what the model should do, how to validate the model, and how to ensure it's robust,\" he said. If there's a silver lining to the funding situation, it's that the science team's work will live on. \"The beauty of this model is that we created a capability — an AI platform, if you want,\" said Bernabe-Moreno. \"And this capability has applications beyond NASA.\" If you want to check out Surya for yourself, you can download the model from Hugging Face .

Amazon has a sale on the latest M4 MacBook Air that knocks up to 20 percent off many configurations. The base model is where you'll get the biggest discount. The 16GB RAM/256GB SSD laptop is down to $799 from $999, which is the lowest price we've seen. You can upgrade to 512GB SSD for $999 , down from $1,199, another all-time low price, or 24GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD for $1,199, down from $1,399. Then there's the 15-inch MacBook Air M4 , whose cheapest model is on sale for $999, dropping from $1,199. The 17 percent discount is the best deal we've seen since the pair debuted in March. As with the 13-inch model, the 16GB and 512GB SSD option is also a record-low price, dropping to $1,199 from $1,399. Then there's the 24GB upgrade , which is $1,399, down from $1,599. We're big fans of the MacBook Air M4, giving it a 92 in our review . Part of that comes from an already lower starting price for the MacBooks than their predecessors. The 2025 models also get a speed boost thanks to the M4 chip and are very thin with a 0.44-inch thickness. Neither the 13- or 15-inch will drag you down, weighing 2.7 pounds and 3.2 pounds, respectively. Plus, they both have excellent battery life, lasting over 18 hours while playing an HD video. The big differences in the 15-inch model mostly come down to size. The screen is obviously bigger, as is its trackpad. Other than that, it offers better speakers than its 13-inch sibling.

Combining Resident Evil-style rendered backgrounds with more agile characters, adding in demons, magic and a feudal Japan setting, the series span multiple sequels — and consoles — til the fourth entry in 2006. Roughly two decades (and console eras) later, Capcom has returned to the series , even getting the definitive samurai actor, Tom Cruise Mifune Toshiro, to play the hero, the legendary swordsman Miyamoto Musashi. At Gamescom, the company is now demoing an early slice of Way of the Sword, which covers most (but not all) of the game shown at SGF 2025 just a few months ago. It’s an interesting time to return to the samurai-meets-demonic-threat universe of Onimusha, following a sudden boom in games tapping into feudal Japan. Most recently, the latest Assassin’s Creed was set there, while, Sony’s upcoming Ghost of Yotei (not to mention its predecessor) both tap bushido and swordplay in historical Japan. While I played through the demo, I made a lot of mental comparisons to Sekiro – a game that’s now several years old and still unbeaten by me. Onimusha draws together similar themes of demon forces run amok, but has a more forgiving approach. Gameplay centers around blocks and parries, plus weak and strong attacks, all while pulling in orbs dropped by dying enemies that act as the game’s currency. (Health orbs are also dropped by certain foes.) Capcom The Oni gauntlet that absorbs these souls can also be used to see invisible demons and unlock areas that are spiritually blocked. It’ll also act like a sort-of demonic movie projector, showing what happened during the demon invasion in the area. Early enemies were predictably sluggish demon swordsmen and archers, getting me back up to speed with how Onimusha fights play out. Even if it predictably looks lightyears ahead of its predecessors, Way of the Sword doesn’t reinvent how you cut up these demon hordes. In comparison to other action games, guarding seems very forgiving. You can hold the guard button down, and it’ll block basic projectiles and melee attacks from all directions I spent some time leaning into exhausting stamina gauges, timing parries for one-hit Issen critical attack and batting away arrows back where they came from. Don’t get me wrong, it’s satisfying and fun, but I’m itching to see how the series will build on what’s pretty basic attack flow. Musashi had acccess to a dual-short sword special attack, Two Celestials, that barrages the enemy with attacks and tops up his health levels. This suggests more special attacks and magical flourishes should open up later in the game. The preview during SGF 2025 also showed ways to utilize the environment for defensive attacks, holding up wooden boards to block arrows, for instance, although that didn’t trigger during my playthrough. Capcom The highlight of the demo was a confrontation with Musashi’s rival, Ganryu Sasaki. He’s great villain fodder — and has also been somehow gifted his own Oni gauntlet. The duel was the only time I felt under threat during the demo, and even then, I didn’t die once. There’s enough of a health meter to test yourself against Sasaki’s lavish sword attacks and lunges. Once you wear down more powerful enemies, you can make a single, concentrated attack to either glean more orbs from them or hit for heavy-duty damage. The early taste of Way of the Sword is a fun, easy romp, so I’m curious to see how Capcom evolves the formula of Onimusha — and where the true challenges might lie.

Settlement development in E1, an open tract of land east of Jerusalem, has been under consideration for more than two decades, but was frozen due to U.S. pressure during previous administrations. The international community overwhelmingly considers Israeli settlement construction in the West Bank to be illegal and an obstacle to peace. Prime minister Anthony Albanese said on Wednesday that he treats leaders of other countries with respect after his Israeli counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu attacked him over his decision to recognise a Palestinian state. “I don’t take these things personally, I engage with people diplomatically. He has had similar things to say about other leaders,” Albanese said during a media briefing. A 58% majority of Americans believe that every country in the United Nations should recognise Palestine as a nation, according to a new Reuters/Ipsos poll, as Israel and Hamas considered a possible truce in the nearly two-year-long war. 33% of respondents did not agree that UN members should recognise a Palestinian state and 9% did not answer. German prosecutors have charged a Russian national they suspect of planning an attack on the Israeli embassy in Berlin and of trying to join militant organisation Islamic State, they said on Wednesday. Prosecutors believe the accused, identified only as Akhmad E. in line with German privacy rules, obtained instructions from the Internet on how to make explosives but the plan failed as he could not get the components he needed.

These lightweight displays are perfect for adding more screen space to your setup without taking up much room — especially useful if you're using a compact laptop or traveling often. Many of the best portable monitors now support USB Type-C connections for easy plug-and-play setups, and some even run entirely on USB power, so you don’t need to carry extra chargers. You’ll also find models with handy extras like built-in speakers, touchscreen support and wide compatibility with Windows laptops and tablets. Whether you’re after a laptop screen extender or a creative companion for photo editing on the go, there’s a portable monitor out there for you. Table of contents Best portable monitors for 2025 Things to consider before buying a portable monitor What to look for in a portable monitor Portable monitor FAQs Best portable monitors for 2025 Things to consider before buying a portable monitor Before you start looking at specific products, it’s super important to think about how and where you plan on using a second monitor as a portable display. Larger panels are great for home use where you may only need to move it or put it away when you have company over. Meanwhile, smaller screens are great for travel and whipping out at a coffee shop or shared workspace. But if you go too small, you may be adding extra weight to your bag without providing a ton of extra utility, especially if it lacks a good USB-C cable or mini HDMI for connectivity. Screen size and compatibility with your existing devices should be top considerations. It’s also important to consider your typical workload, as artists may get extra value out of monitors with higher maximum brightness, HDR, wider color accuracy and a higher contrast ratio. Those who spend all day looking at spreadsheets won’t get as much value from more vibrant displays or FHD displays with high refresh rates, but they may still benefit from having a basic plug-and-play second monitor for multitasking. What to look for in a portable monitor Aside from price and screen size, some of the most important specs in a portable monitor include panel type, pixels per inch, brightness, refresh rate and connectivity. Most portable monitors use IPS LCD displays, which generally offer good viewing angles, strong brightness and good power efficiency. However, some higher resolution models now feature OLED screens that support wider color gamuts, better color accuracy and contrast ratio, which can be a major benefit for artists and content creators. Some budget models may use TN panels, as that can help cut costs and reduce energy consumption. That said, we generally try to stay away from those as they often have worse image quality compared to IPS screens. For brightness, 300 nits is the lowest we recommend — anything less can make the monitor hard to use even in some indoor environments. Ideally, we look for screens that are closer to 350 or 400 nits and above for better accuracy and visibility. Connectivity is also important because if you can’t easily hook your phone, gaming console, or laptop to a monitor, it becomes an oversized paperweight. Most travel displays include an HDMI port or USB-C port(or both), which cover the large majority of devices. It’s rare to find a portable monitor these days with only USB-A, since the majority of devices have moved over to USB-C. However, we also like models that support passthrough power over USB-C connections, which reduces the complexity of your setup and decreases the number of cords and adapters you have to carry around. Finally, most portable monitors feature 60Hz refresh rates, which is fine for most use cases. However, if you’re looking for a gaming monitor, there are models with 120Hz or even 240Hz refresh rates. These are excellent choices for gamers looking to maintain smooth fps while playing on the go. Portable monitor FAQs What are the disadvantages of a portable monitor? The main disadvantage of a portable monitor in comparison to a regular monitor is size. Most portable monitors sit in the 14- to 17-inch range to allow them to be as portable as their name suggests. While you can find some portable monitors sized at 20 inches or larger, they become less and less convenient to take on the go the larger they get. What is the difference between a tablet and a portable monitor? A tablet is essentially a portable computer that can run apps, games and more without a supporting device. Portable monitors are indeed supportive devices designed to expand your screen real estate; in order for them to have any use, they must be connected to a laptop or tablet. What ports should I look for in a portable monitor? The most important port to look for on a portable monitor is the one with which you'll connect the monitor to your computer. Most portable monitors will have either an HDMI or USB-C port to do this. After that, it's handy for a portable monitor to have other connectors such as a USB-A port, extra USB-C ports and others for you to hook up additional accessories.

The impact of a good, feature-rich and — perhaps most importantly — ergonomic mouse can be huge. Not just to your productivity, but to the quality and comfort of your worklife overall. A good mouse has long offered some level of configuration and customization, but more modern options go beyond that with the ability to automate repetitive tasks or convoluted keypresses at the click of a button. Unsurprisingly, even mice haven’t escaped the wave of AI hype, with many flagship models bringing services like ChatGPT or Copilot to your fingertips. Beyond the fancy features, there’s still a lot to consider to find the best mouse for work, creativity or even play. Will the mouse fit your grip style or handedness? Do you prefer the convenience of Bluetooth or stability of a 2.4Ghz USB dongle? Can it connect to more than one device easily? Is the smoothness of the scroll wheel going to be a dealbreaker? Perhaps the companion software unlocks new functionality you never knew you needed? If you hadn’t considered all of those things, the good news is, we have (and more). Below are our picks for the best wireless productivity mice you can buy right now.

What's up TikTok?\" Trump's administration believes TikTok helped him win over young voters in the 2024 Presidential election, with the account he used to campaign having over 15 million followers. \"President Trump's message dominated TikTok during his presidential campaign, and we're excited to build upon those successes and communicate in a way no other administration has before,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement . The president wasn't always fond of the platform. He once vowed to ban the app in the US and signed an executive order to outlaw any transaction between the app and its China-based parent company ByteDance for national security reasons. TikTok's \"data collection threatens to allow the Chinese Communist Party access to Americans' personal and proprietary information — potentially allowing China to track the locations of Federal employees and contractors, build dossiers of personal information for blackmail, and conduct corporate espionage,\" the executive order read . After taking office earlier this year, however, Trump quickly put a pause on the law that was supposed to ban TikTok in the US. He even delayed the ban a couple more times to give ByteDance more time to sell its US business. Trump previously claimed that a \"very wealthy\" group is poised to buy TikTok, but the administration has yet to reveal the identities of the people in it.

The OS 26es are bringing huge upgrades to your iPhone and iPad's operating systems. One you've probably heard us talk about numerous times is the visual update: Liquid Glass . (It's like the better-executed version of Windows Vista .) We spent two weeks test-driving it — you can check out our detailed hands-on iOS 26 preview , or you can try it out yourself by downloading and installing the public beta 2 . That software is a more stable iteration of the separate developer version, which recently hit the beta 7 waypoint, and offers a few more flashy features not yet available in the public version. (While the public beta is open to everyone and quite stable, always remember there's a degree of risk involved with beta software.) Additionally, there are credible reports that iOS 26 could bring a new live translation feature to AirPods , too. Not sure if you want to upgrade your smartphone or tablet this year? No worries, we'll help you find out if your devices will be able to run iOS 26. While Apple didn't nix any iPhones from its eligibility list last year, that's not the case for 2025 — a few models are getting cut this time. All iPhone 8 models and the iPhone X were the last to get the boot in 2023, and this year the 2018 models are getting left behind. If you have an ineligible device, you won't be able to download iOS 26 when it becomes available this fall. We'll get to the bottom of which iPhones and iPads will support iOS 26 and iPadOS 26 this year. To see what's coming with the latest OSes, check out everything announced at Apple's WWDC June 9 event . One thing you shouldn't immediately expect is Apple's updated version of Siri , though the company is reportedly working on a 'stripped-down' AI chatbot to compete with ChatGPT. These three iPhones won't be compatible with iOS 26 Unlike last year, several iPhone models won't be eligible to download the newest iOS when it makes its debut this fall. This trio of models first released in 2018 won't be coming to the iOS 26 party: iPhone XR iPhone XS iPhone XS Max iPhones compatible with iOS 26 While we don't yet know the new iPhones Apple will be dropping this fall — though there are iPhone 17 rumors — we do know, per Apple's site , that the phones listed below will be compatible with iOS 26. Basically, if you have an iPhone that was announced in 2019 or later, you're in the clear: iPhone SE (second generation or later) iPhone 11 iPhone 11 Pro iPhone 11 Pro Max iPhone 12 iPhone 12 mini iPhone 12 Pro iPhone 12 Pro Max iPhone 13 iPhone 13 mini iPhone 13 Pro iPhone 13 Pro Max iPhone 14 iPhone 14 Plus iPhone 14 Pro iPhone 14 Pro Max iPhone 15 iPhone 15 Plus iPhone 15 Pro iPhone 15 Pro Max iPhone 16 iPhone 16 Plus iPhone 16 Pro iPhone 16 Pro Max iPhone 16e iPads compatible with iPadOS 26 The iPads listed below, and any iPads released later this year, are eligible to download iPadOS 26 . iPad Pro (M4) iPad Pro 12.9‑inch (3rd generation and later) iPad Pro 11‑inch (1st generation and later) iPad Air (3rd generation and later, including M2 and M3) iPad (8th generation and later, including A16) iPad mini (5th generation and later, including A17 Pro) What if I don't want to buy a new iPhone? If you want to continue using your older iPhone that isn't supported by iOS 26, that's fine. However, you'll miss out on security updates which could potentially put your phone at risk for malware and other threats. Additionally, some apps may stop working if they require a certain version of iOS or later. And of course, you won't be able to access the latest features iOS 26 offers. When will iOS 26 become available? Apple usually rolls out its latest iOS in mid-September, just a few days before the new iPhones hit store shelves. Last year, it released iOS 18 on Monday, Sept. 16. Expect a confirmation of the release date at the iPhone 17 event, expected in early September. iOS 26 features we're excited about Liquid Glass design : Your home screen is getting revamped with new app icons, including dark mode and all-clear options. You'll also notice buttons with a new floating design. Liquid Glass was designed to make all of Apple's OSes more cohesive. Phone app redesign: You'll finally be able to scroll through contacts, recent calls and voicemail messages all on one screen. It also comes with a new feature called Hold Assist that'll notify you when an agent comes to the phone so you can avoid the elevator music. Live Translate: iOS 26 is bringing the ability to have a conversation via phone call or text message with someone who speaks another language. Live Translate will translate your conversation in real time. Polls feature: Coming to group messages in the Messages app, chat members will be able to create polls. This can help prevent the unwanted 30+ messages when it comes to deciding which restaurant you're meeting at this weekend.

Thanks to a parade of leaks, we think we know mostly what to expect today — Pixel 10 phones, along with new watches and earbuds — but we'll know for sure later today. That's because the event kicks off at 1PM ET. If you want to be the first to hear the official scoop, you can tune into the Made by Google YouTube channel (or right here!) to catch Google's event, which will be hosted by Jimmy Fallon and also include other celebrities like Stephen Curry , Lando Norris and the Jonas Brothers — get ready for some potentially awkward cue card readings! And open a second window to follow our Pixel event liveblog for real-time analysis. Sam Rutherford for Engadget What's on tap? You can expect a more power-efficient Tensor G5 processor in all the new Pixel 10 phones. (That could help power new Gemini AI features , too.) The base-level Pixel 10 should get a big camera upgrade: a 5x telephoto lens. Before this generation, you had to splurge on a Pro or Fold model to get optical zoom. Cameras will be higher-res across the board, too. In other areas, Qi2 magnetic charging is expected to come to the new Pixels. Expect a new accessory ecosystem, a la Apple's MagSafe , dubbed \"Pixelsnap.\" We'll also likely see the Pixel Watch 4 with a larger battery and smaller bezels . And the Pixel Buds 2a could bring refinements to the company's budget earbuds . Engadget's Pixel 10 leak roundup will give you a much more detailed dive into the rumors. You can head back here on August 20 at 1PM ET to watch live. Live from NYC, it's #MadeByGoogle '25!

According to the FAQ entry about a possible release window, the team says \"Well, to be honest—even Yocar himself has absolutely no idea\" when it'll be ready. But the same page does confirm that the plan is for Zhong Kui to launch on both PC and \"all mainstream console platforms\" whenever it is done. From the title and the previous Black Myth game, this new project will once again be drawing inspiration from Chinese mythology. Legends around Zhong Kui dub him a conqueror of ghosts and evil spirits, so perhaps there will be some supernatural vibes in this entry to the emerging game series.

According to the FAQ entry about a possible release window, the team says \"Well, to be honest—even Yocar himself has absolutely no idea\" when it'll be ready. But the same page does confirm that the plan is for Zhong Kui to launch on both PC and \"all mainstream console platforms\" whenever it is done. From the title and the previous Black Myth game, this new project will once again be drawing inspiration from Chinese mythology. Legends around Zhong Kui dub him a conqueror of ghosts and evil spirits, so perhaps there will be some supernatural vibes in this entry to the emerging game series. Pretty much the only other thing we know besides the name and character is that Black Myth: Zhong Kui will once again be a single-player ARPG and it will be \"following the same business model as before.\" This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/black-myth-zhong-kui-is-the-next-title-from-game-science-studio-221537808.html?src=rss", "ingested_utc": "2025-08-19T22:39:47Z"}

Season two of Prime Video's Fallout TV show will debut on December 17. The second season had already been loosely pegged for a December release when the news of a third season appeared earlier this year, and the studio shared a few still images of the cast in the upcoming New Vegas setting just yesterday. The announcement during the Opening Night Live show for Gamescom 2025 also included a surprisingly lengthy teaser trailer with a few tidbits about what to expect in the next eight episodes of the hugely popular video game adaptation. It includes footage of the show's first Deathclaw, that well-known and oft-despised enemy from the world of the games. Alongside returning stars Ella Purnell, Aaron Moten and Walton Goggins, the teaser reveals that Justin Theroux has been cast as Mr. House, the enigmatic leader of New Vegas.

Ethan Foltz has been accused of running Rapper Bot, also known as Eleven Eleven Botnet and CowBot, and using it to execute coordinated distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. The complaint claims that Rapper Bot was used to target victims in more than 80 countries, and since April 2025, it has reportedly conducted more than 370,000 attacks against 18,000 unique victims. \"Rapper Bot was one of the most powerful DDoS botnets to ever exist,\" US Attorney Michael J. Heyman for the District of Alaska said. \"Our office remains committed to disrupting and dismantling cyber criminals that threaten internet security and infrastructure in the District of Alaska and across the United States.\" One of Rapper Bot's alleged victims was X, which was taken down by a DDoS attack in March. At the time, owner Elon Musk made unsubstantiated claims about the attack being perpetrated by a \"large, coordinated group and/or a country\" and that it stemmed from IP addresses in Ukraine, although security researchers said it was possible the social network had left servers unsecured .

The Reels feature uses generative AI to translate your voice, with optional lip-syncing. Mark Zuckerberg first previewed the feature at Meta Connect 2024. At launch, the translations are only available for English to Spanish (and vice versa). The company says more languages will arrive later. At least at first, it's restricted to Facebook creators with 1,000+ followers. However, anyone with a public Instagram account can use it. The tool trains on your original voice and generates a translated audio track to match your tone. The lip-syncing add-on then matches your mouth's movements to the translated speech. The demo clip the company showed last year was spot-on — eerily so. Meta To use the feature, choose the \"Translate your voice with Meta AI\" option before publishing a reel. That's also where you can choose to add lip syncing. There's an option to review the AI-translated version before publishing. Viewers will see a pop-up noting that it's an AI translation. Meta says the feature works best for face-to-camera videos. The company recommends avoiding covering your mouth or including excessive background music. It works for up to two speakers, but it's best to avoid overlapping your speech. The company frames the feature as a way for creators to expand their audiences beyond their native tongues. As such, it included a by-language performance tracker, so you can see how well it's doing in each language. YouTube launched a similar feature last year. Apple has gotten in on the action, too: Messages, Phone and FaceTime apps have live translation tools in iOS 26.

The tech giant will shell out $30 million to settle the proposed class-action suit. According to Reuters , the plaintiffs' lawyers said there could be 35 million to 45 million class members. Children aged 13 or younger who watched YouTube between July 1, 2013 and April 1, 2020 could be covered. The proposed settlement was filed last night and now awaits judge approval. This settlement amounts to a slap on the wrist compared to the $170 million fine Google faced in 2019 following a similar suit brought by the Federal Trade Commission for alleged violations of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. Under the terms of that case, YouTube had agreed to stop collecting data on videos aimed at children, and both YouTube and Google were prohibited from future COPPA violations.

The MMX 230 wireless is the new flagship model, and it’s the first Beyerdynamic gaming headset with a user-replaceable battery. The battery pack offers up to 60 hours of listening between charges. The 230 features Bluetooth 6.0 for low-latency connections, as well as a microphone with environmental noise cancellation for clear communications. The headset's 40mm drivers are tuned for spatial sound, helping gamers hear directional cues. Both the MMX 150 and MMX 230 will be available in black or white. Each model will ship with a low-latency USB-C dongle, a USB-A adapter and a 1.8-meter USB-C to 3.5mm cable. The MMX 150 will sell for $250 CAD while the MMX 230 comes in at $350 CAD. The headsets will be for sale via Beyerdynamic's online store in Q4 of 2025. It's not entirely clear at this point if they will be available in the United States.

You can expect a more power-efficient Tensor G5 processor in all the new Pixel 10 phones. (That could help power new Gemini AI features , too.) The base-level Pixel 10 should get a big camera upgrade: a 5x telephoto lens. Before this generation, you had to splurge on a Pro or Fold model to get optical zoom. Cameras will be higher-res across the board, too. In other areas, Qi2 magnetic charging is expected to come to the new Pixels. Expect a new accessory ecosystem, a la Apple's MagSafe , dubbed \"Pixelsnap.\" We'll also likely see the Pixel Watch 4 with a larger battery and smaller bezels .

This remaster was set to support modern frame rates and higher resolutions than the original title. In other words, there's a lot riding on this upcoming sequel. BioShock Infinite is over 12 years old at this point and the franchise has been mostly dormant in that time. Here's hoping that Fergusson can reinvigorate the series.

Images captured by the floating watchtower revealed a previously unknown moon orbiting Uranus. The discovery, made on February 2, increases the planet's moon tally to 29. The moon was easy to miss: It's only an estimated six miles wide. It's located about 35,000 miles from Uranus' center, orbiting the planet's equatorial plane. The moon has a nearly circular orbit, suggesting it could have formed near its current location. NASA's short video below shows the faint speck orbiting its ringed host. The new moon joins 13 other small moons in Uranus' orbit. The planet also has five major moons (Miranda, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania and Oberon) and 10 irregular ones. The new moon won't have a name until one is approved by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). It was detected using 10 40-minute long-exposure images taken by Webb's Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam). A team led by the Southwest Research Institute pored through the telescope's images to identify it. \"No other planet has as many small inner moons as Uranus, and their complex inter-relationships with the rings hint at a chaotic history that blurs the boundary between a ring system and a system of moons,” Matthew Tiscareno of the SETI Institute wrote. “Moreover, the new moon is smaller and much fainter than the smallest of the previously known inner moons, making it likely that even more complexity remains to be discovered.” This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/science/space/webb-telescope-spots-a-new-moon-orbiting-uranus-182932627.html?src=rss", "ingested_utc": "2025-08-19T18:54:15Z"}

Microsoft revealed the release date for the upcoming shooter sequel alongside a new trailer during Opening Night Live at Gamescom 2025 . Notably, while Black Ops 7 will be on PC, PlayStation and Xbox at launch, it'll skip the Switch 2, despite a binding legal agreement between Microsoft and Nintendo that requires that the company's consoles receive the same access to Call of Duty as Xbox. Similar to past games in the series, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 is leaning into a trippy narrative and a futuristic setting. The sequel is set 40 years after the events of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 , and follows David Mason (as played by Milo Ventimiglia) and his squad of Black Ops operatives as they take on \"a manipulative enemy who weaponizes fear above all else,\" according to publisher Activision. Microsoft, who owns the Call of Duty franchise following the completion of its acquisition of Activision Blizzard King in 2023, originally signed on for a 10-year pact with Nintendo to bring Call of Duty games to the Switch. The company made the commitment — and another, vaguer one with PlayStation — in an attempt to smooth over any opposition to gobbling up another large publisher. The acquisition was ultimately allowed to move forward, and Microsoft has so far ended up bringing even more of what could have been exclusive games to other consoles. Black Ops 7 has name recognition and a devoted fan base on its side, but it'll face some healthy competition this fall. Battlefield 6 is set to be released on October 10 , and based on the response to the beta alone , it seems like time away has made EA' shooter franchise all the more popular. Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 will be available on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Steam and Battle.net. Xbox Game Pass subscribers will get the game at launch. The game will come to Switch later in 2025.

Ahead of the announcement, the publisher hosted a new preview of the game, giving the gaming press a chance to check out a new playable character and zone (more on those in a moment). I didn't get a chance to play Absolum when it was first announced back in March , so going into this latest demo I didn't know what to expect. Now, after playing Absolum through most of the weekend, I can't wait for the final version in October. In fact, I think it might end up being a surprise game of the year contender for a lot of people. I've never been a fan of beat-'em-ups; most haven't had enough depth to keep me interested. Absolum solves that issue by smartly borrowing from modern roguelikes, with Supergiant's Hades standing as an obvious influence. Each run in Absolum starts with you selecting a \"Ritual\" for your character. Like Boons in Hades , these modify your character's abilities with special properties. For example, one Ritual I encountered in my second playthrough caused throwable rose daggers to spawn whenever I timed a dodge perfectly. In turn, these allowed me to quickly dispatch dangerous enemies at a distance. The further into a run you get, the more likely you are to encounter additional Rituals. And, once again borrowing from Hades and its idea of Duo Boons, some Rituals are designed to synergize with one another. Combined with the game's Arcana system, which allows you to select up to two special attacks for your character, there's great combat variety in Absolum. Dotemu In fact, it never feels like you're simply button mashing. Combat is very Souls-like in that there are many different enemies for the player to take on, and each one requires its own approach. What's more, dodging attacks is often more important than dishing out damage. Healing items in Absolum are few and far between, but to balance this, the game gives you a few different ways to avoid getting hurt. You can either side step away from an attack, dash directly into an enemy to block them or use your character's Skill attack to perform what the game calls a \"Clash.\" If timed correctly, all three options allow you to punish an enemy for trying to get the jump on you. Of the three, however, Clashes — acting as Absolum's version of a parry — are the hardest to pull off, but can turn a boss fight in your favor, allowing you to deflect an attack that would have otherwise been devastating. With this preview, Dotemu let everyone try the game's full roster of four characters. Over the five hours I played the demo, I had the most fun with Galandra, a necromantic warrior with a sword on her back that would be big enough even for Guts. Each character feels distinct from their counterparts. Brome, for instance, who wasn't in the recent Steam Next Fest demo Dotemu released, is the game's only mage-like character. His playstyle centers around zoning your enemies with beams of power. Oh, and did I mention that he's a frog? Meanwhile, the new zone, Jaroba, did a great job of mixing things up just as I was getting used to ebb and flow of Absolum's combat . Enemies here employ much more devious attacks that are harder to dodge and counter. If rougelike fans didn't have Hades 2 to look forward to this year, I think Absolum would easily be in the running for one of the best indie releases of 2025. As it stands, the game has tough competition, but if you're a fan of challenging and mechanically complex but fun combat systems, I think you owe it to yourself to check out Absolum come October when it arrives on Steam , Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and PS5.

Moore's take on Battlestar Galactica ended its official TV run in 2009, the most surprising thing about the series is that it hasn't inspired many great games. Sure, more than a few releases have carried the Battlestar Galactica name, but none of those have managed to capture what made the 2003 miniseries and later 2004 show so special. That might change early next year when Battlestar Galactica: Scattered Hopes arrives. Ahead of today's announcement of the game, publisher Dotemu gave the gaming press a chance to play an early build of Scattered Hopes . The first thing you need to know about the game is that it's made by Alt Shift, the studio behind 2019's Crying Suns . Alt Shift doesn't shy away from the fact Crying Suns was inspired by Battlestar Galactica, and the studio's love for the source material shows in its new project. Even in the version I played, which was missing gameplay features and had yet to be properly balanced, Scattered Hopes feels like BSG's three-hour pilot episode recreated in game form. Alt Shift / Dotemu In Scattered Hopes, you're tasked with leading a fleet of ships fleeing the destruction of Caprica. Like Crying Suns, the game is a roguelike, meaning gameplay revolves around randomized runs and you're expected to fail your mission multiple times before you get anywhere close to success. At the start of each run, you pick a fleet, with each one offering a different mix of military and civilian ships for you to command. Once you're underway, gameplay is a mix of turn-based and real-time strategy as your fleet jumps from system to system to try and outrun the Cylons. When you first arrive in a sector, you have a handful of turns to carry out scavenging missions, repairs to your fleet and research that will enhance your combat abilities. During this time, situations can develop among the survivors of the Twelve Colonies. For example, on my first run, a group of thieves started stealing supplies from the fleet. What's interesting about these scenarios is that you'll frequently be forced to choose between different factions among your survivors, representing the interests of workers, military personnel and other more shady elements. Often, these groups will come forward on their own to offer you something, but those gifts never come free, and you need to balance the influence of each group, lest one become too powerful. Alt Shift / Dotemu After a few turns of this, the Cylons will arrive and will always do so with overwhelming force. These battles play out in real-time, though there's a tactical pause in case things get too hectic. At the start of my first run, I only had one Battlestar and two fighter squadrons to fight off everything that came my way. The goal of these encounters is not to defeat the Cylons, but rather to stay alive as long as it takes for the faster than light drives on your ships to spin up. These battles are the most fun part of the experience. They're absolutely hectic, and I found making it out with minimal damage to my fleet required prioritizing the right targets. That's easier said than done. The Cylons often sent a homing missile or tactical nuke my way that forced me to redirect my fighter squadrons to intercept those, leaving the rest of my fleet vulnerable. Even in its early state, with seemingly a lot of work left for Alt Shift to do before the game ships early next year, Scattered Hopes is an incredibly fun exercise in crisis management, and I'm hopeful the studio can stick the landing. In the meantime, you can wish list the game on Steam.

Yes, you read that correctly. Denshattack! is the latest game from Barcelona indie studio Undercoders, and it's a delirious, high-speed action experience complete with flow states, a banging original soundtrack, flamboyant characters and coming-of-age drama. Players attempt to keep their train moving while jumping, wall riding, spinning, landing tricks and nailing combos. Between the rail-hopping action, there's a fully voice-acted story (in English and Japanese) about overcoming oppression and finding your true friends. It's a wacky mix of ideas, but it all comes together in a Jet Set Radio type of world that looks like a real thrill. Undercoders is based in Spain, but the studio founders have spent a lot of time backpacking through Japan, visiting the trains specifically. In a virtual briefing ahead of Denshattack! 's reveal at Gamescom Opening Night Live 2025 , director David Jaumandreu and his team couldn't stop giggling about how much they loved trains, and it was all fairly adorable. Denshattack! is due out in early 2026 for PC , PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, and it'll be available day-one on Game Pass. It features music from lead composer Tee Lopes, who's best known for Sonic Mania , Sonic Frontiers and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge , and additional artists from video game music label Kid Katana will contribute to the soundtrack.

In some cases, this can delay log queries from being served anywhere between 5 seconds to 2 minutes on Arbitrum One during long tail unindexing. We’ve observed that this happens roughly once per day based on Arbitrum One mainnet traffic levels. As such, Nitro 3.7.0 is not recommended for teams who need to serve log queries with consistent latency (e.g. eth_getLogs , eth_getFilterLogs , eth_getFilterChanges ). Teams running their own log indexers may be unaffected by these changes though. Future releases of Nitro are expected to fix the issue of log indexing being able to block log queries.

These are some of the only sleep earbuds with ANC, which could be a boon for light sleepers that live in busy metropolitan areas. The company says they \"effectively block out snoring, pet sounds, appliance hum and outside traffic noise.\" There are other techy additions here, beyond ANC. Anker's proprietary Ear Canal Adaptation algorithm adjusts to unique ear shapes for \"deeper noise reduction.\" The charging case also includes a microphone that monitors and analyzes ambient noise for snoring. Once snores are detected, it optimizes the ANC to mask that specific noise. This could end up saving some relationships. The earbuds can also deliver binaural frequencies to each ear, which the company says helps \"sync your brainwaves with calming patterns to promote relaxation and restful sleep.\" Users can make adjustments to any of these systems via the Soundcore app, which also lets people set alarms, create sleep reminders and more. Not everyone can handle clunky earbuds when trying to fall asleep, so the company tried to increase the comfort with this latest release. The Sleep A30 earbuds include a silicone exterior, short nozzles and a slim profile. The developers created 3D maps of \"thousands of ear canals\" to make sure it would fit most users comfortably. We haven't gotten a chance to try these yet, but the reviews so far are mostly positive . I'm a bit wary of ANC masking all ambient noise during sleep in case of an emergency, but maybe that's just me. In any event, the Soundcore Sleep A30 earbuds are available right now in two colorways.

The announcement came during a marathon 45-minute Nintendo Direct devoted entirely to the new game, hosted by Kirby's creator Masahiro Sakurai. Sakurai said he was asked to create Air Riders while still working on DLC for Super Smash Bros. Ultimate , and drafted a written proposal for the game at the request of Shinya Takahashi, head of software development for Nintendo. The Direct showed a roster of playable characters, including King Dedede, Meta Knight, Bandana Waddle Dee, Knuckle Joe and others. Each rider has distinct traits and special attacks that influence how their machines perform. The ride mechanics will be fairly simple, with players able to boost, drift, glide and rail-grind their way around. Players will be able to customize and upgrade their vehicles throughout the game, which includes two major modes. Air Ride is the straightforward racing mode, with players competing on themed tracks. City Trial lets players explore a floating island called Skyah, where they can find power-ups and encounter random events like Dustup Derby, where they battle opponents to knock them out and earn more power-ups. Once players feel their machine is sufficiently powered up, they can head to the Stadium to complete different challenges against opponents. Local multiplayer supports up to eight players, while online lobbies can hold 16. A demo version of Kirby Air Riders will be playable by reservation for attendees of PAX West 2025 in Seattle at the end of the month. Masahiro Sakurai said a similar demo will be available to play at Gamescom in Cologne this week. Kirby Air Riders will release on November 20 and marks yet another Switch 2 exclusive coming early in the life cycle of the hit console. Nintendo has already found success with Donkey Kong Bananza and Mario Kart World .

Team Cherry just announced a livestream for the long-anticipated sequel Hollow Knight: Silksong . It takes place on August 21 at 10:30AM ET. The company says it will be making a \"special announcement\" about the game. We don't exactly know what this announcement will be, but it's starting to feel like a release date or at least a release window. Rumors have been swirling that the title would finally be getting a release date during this week's Gamescom festivities , with Geoff Keighley offering a tease a couple of days ago . This is all happening more than six years after the game was first announced . It's possible that the special announcement won't involve the release date at all, but will instead offer new game modes or a deeper dive into the story. It's worth noting that reports have indicated that the game would finally see the light of day this year , though we've been fooled by that kind of thing before. For the uninitiated, Hollow Knight: Silksong is the followup to Hollow Knight , which was an indie Metroidvania that absolutely took the world by storm. It actually started as DLC for the original game before the developers realized the scope of their ambitions would take nearly seven years to see through. Correction, August 19, 2025, 12:55PM ET : This story originally stated that the livestream was set for April 21. That was a mistake, as the actual date is August 21.

On August 26, gear inspired by Halo 3: ODST will be available in the Sony-published Helldivers game. Practically speaking, this is about some new armor, guns and abilities — just another Tuesday in the gaming world. But symbolically, it evokes Sonic the Hedgehog's first appearance on a Nintendo console. The crossover's arrival coincides with Helldivers 2's arrival on Xbox Series X/S . (That's also on August 26.) It also comes amid rumors that Halo: The Master Chief Collection could arrive on PlayStation as soon as this year. The times they are a-changin', as Microsoft adjusts to its new reality as a console hardware also-ran . The gear will be available through the Helldivers 2 x Halo: ODST Legendary Warbond. In Helldivers, a Warbond is essentially a non-expiring equivalent of a battle pass . This one costs 1,500 Super Credits in the game's Acquisitions Center. Here, ODST no longer means Orbital Drop Shock Troopers. Adopting Helldivers' cheeky tone, it now stands for Obedient Democracy Support Troopers. Kind of them to lend a hand to the cause. PlayStation So, what do you get for those Super Credits? The standout is the Halo 3: ODST armor, which has a Master Chief-esque flair. There are two variants: A-9 Helljumper Armor Set modeled after an ODST trooper. Meanwhile, the A-35 Recon Armor Set is a stealth-focused variant. Both include a Feet First passive boost. This makes you quieter, increases your range when finding points of interest and makes you immune to leg injuries. As for the guns, you get the Halo series' classic MA5C Assault Rifle and M6C / SOCOM Pistol. Also available for your arsenal: the M90A Shotgun and M7S SMG. And who doesn't love a cape? There are two of those — one with an ODST logo and an Eye of the Clandestine one for the stealth getup. The Helldivers 2 x Halo: ODST warbond arrives on August 26 at 8AM ET.

As a warning, the Anker 621 MagGo requires a magnetic connection via the smartphone itself or a magnetic case. It won't work with non-magnetic cases. It also runs a bit hot, reaching internal temperatures of up to 118 F, which could be something to keep an eye on during use. Follow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice .

Sony introduced the Inzone line in 2022 and it offers peripherals such as monitors and earbuds for gaming consumers. The new wave of gaming gear was developed with major esports organization Fnatic, and the specs are meant to target competitive players. All of the items are available for pre-order today. The lineup includes a pair of audio devices: the Inzone H9 II Wireless Gaming Headset and the Inzone E9 In-Ear Monitor. The H9 II headset has the same dynamic driver as the excellent Sony WH-1000XM6 headphones, and it sports a detachable mic. It can be used wired or as a Bluetooth wireless set. These headphones have active noise canceling and 360 Spatial Sound. It will retail for $350. The E9 monitor also offers 360 Spatial Sound and is designed for passive noise canceling. It costs $150. Fnatic's Valorant and Apex Legends teams assisted the creation of the audio products. Sam Rutherford for Engadget The company also has a new gaming mouse simply called Mouse-A that was designed with feedback from Fnatic pro players. The Mouse-A weighs a slight 48 grams and offers hybrid optical switches. The $150 mouse also has an 8,000Hz polling rate and promises up to 90 hours of battery life. For extra cushioning, Inzone has also unveiled two mousepads. The 6mm Mat-F is intended for strategic first person shooters and games that favor controlled stop and aim playstyles. The black design has a Slimflex base and will retail for $60. Mat-D costs $35 and is meant more for speedy gameplay with gliding movements. The purple gradient mousepad is 4mm and has a high density rubber base. Finally, the Inzone KBD-H75 is a $300 wired aluminum 75 percent rapid trigger keyboard that comes equipped with Hall-effect switches and an 8,000Hz polling rate.

Gamescom is the planet's largest gaming event and we're sure to find out about a bunch of interesting new games at the Opening Night Live showcase. Xbox is broadcasting from the show floor across two days, and there will be other presentations that are worth keeping an eye on, including a \"special announcement\" for Hollow Knight: Silksong . Gamescom is taking place between August 20 and 24 this year, and we're learning bits and pieces about what to expect from the various showcases. The affair will kick off with Opening Night Live, a showcase hosted by Geoff Keighley that bridges the gap between his two other major events, Summer Game Fest Live and The Game Awards. That will be followed by two days of Xbox broadcasts, the latest edition of the Future Games Show and three days of Bethesda streams. There will also be news from Ubisoft on what's next for The Division 2 . The company will host two panels related to the franchise during Gamescom. One will include more info about The Division Resurgence ( a delayed mobile game ), as well details about a \"big Division 2 project.\" We'll update this preview with more Gamescom details as we get them, and embed video versions of each stream as they become available too. Here's our breakdown of how to watch Gamescom 2025 and what to expect from the event. Gamescom schedule Opening Night Live — August 19, 1:30PM ET (pre-show), 2PM (main show) Xbox @ gamescom 2025 Broadcast — August 20, 9AM ET Future Games Show — August 20, 2PM ET Xbox @ gamescom 2025 Broadcast — August 21, 9AM ET Hollow Knight: Silksong - Special Announcement — August 21, 10:30AM ET Awesome Indies — August 21, 12PM ET Bethesda — August 22-25 How to watch Gamescom Opening Night Live - August 19, 2PM ET Watch on YouTube Opening Night Live perhaps won't feature as many heavy hitters as Summer Game Fest Live or The Game Awards typically have, but one thing's for certain: Call of Duty fans will definitely want to tune in. The two-hour showcase will feature the \"worldwide reveal\" of Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. We'll almost certainly get a release date here too. Reports suggest we won't get a release date for Hollow Knight: Silksong at ONL, but we may not have to wait much longer... (more on that in a bit). You can also expect a trailer for multiplayer RPG Honor of Kings: World, along with new looks at Ghost of Yotei , The Outer Worlds 2 , Resident Evil Requiem, Silent Hill f, Ninja Gaiden 4, Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion and The Seven Deadly Sins: Origin. You'll get to see the opening cinematic for the World of Warcraft: Midnight expansion as well. It won't all be game reveals and announcements, though — there'll be a performance of music from Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 featuring composer Lorien Testard and vocalist Alice Duport-Percier. Additionally, you'll get a peek at season two of Prime Video's Fallout series, which will arrive in December. We'll be keeping tabs on all the news from Opening Night Live right here on Engadget. Myself, senior editor Jess Conditt and editor-in-chief Aaron Souppouris will be live-blogging our way through ONL. Join us! It should be fun. How to watch Xbox @ gamescom 2025 Day 1 Broadcast — August 20, 9AM ET Watch on YouTube , Twitch , TikTok or Facebook One major piece of news we're likely to get from Xbox during one of its streams (if it isn't revealed at ONL beforehand) is the release date and pricing for the ASUS ROG Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X handheld systems. Leaker billbil-kun has reported the devices will arrive on October 16, at least in Europe, costing €599 for the Xbox Ally and €899 for the higher-end Xbox Ally X. Microsoft had already confirmed these handhelds would be available in time for the holiday season, so that rumored release date makes sense. Either way, we should get confirmation during Gamescom of when to expect these devices, especially since the company says it will discuss the handhelds during its August 20 stream. This particular event will feature the likes of Grounded 2, Keeper and Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 . The Order of Giants , an expansion for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, will be showcased alongside Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade, Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, Dying Light: The Beast, World of Warcraft: Midnight, Hotel Barcelona, Invincible Vs., Cronos: The New Dawn, Outbound, Powerwash Simulator 2 and Starsand Island. Along with the English-language broadcast, Xbox's streams will be available in other languages on regional Xbox channels on the likes of YouTube, Twitch, TikTok and Facebook. The streams will be available in Traditional Chinese, German, French, Japanese, Brazilian Portuguese and Mexican Spanish, as well as with ASL and English audio descriptions. How to watch Future Games Show — August 20, 2PM ET Watch on Twitch or YouTube Actors David Hayter (Snake in the Metal Gear series) and Maggie Robertson (Lady Dimitrescu in Resident Evil Village ) will be hosting this edition of the Future Games Show. This installment will feature more than 50 games across world premieres, new trailers and sudden demo releases. Capcom, Bandai Namco Entertainment, EA and NACON are among those who'll be represented in this one, which will feature projects from AAA and indie publishers and studios. Several games have been confirmed to make an appearance here, including Skate (which is slated to hit early access this year ), Resident Evil Requiem, Cronos: The New Dawn, Hotel Barcelona, Deer & Boy, The Seven Deadly Sins: Origin and Katanaut . Not only that, there will be a post-show that will run for 40 minutes and feature more trailers, world premieres and demo announcements. How to watch Xbox @ gamescom 2025 Day 2 Broadcast — August 21, 9AM ET Watch on YouTube , Twitch , TikTok or Facebook Xbox will be broadcasting live from the Gamescom show floor for a second straight day. This particular stream will include details on Ninja Gaiden 4, The Outer Worlds 2 and Overwatch 2 (perhaps with more info about Season 18, which is set to start on August 26). You can also expect looks at Onimusha: Way of the Sword, At Fate's End, Age of Empires IV, High on Life 2, Jurassic World Evolution 3 and Fragpunk . In addition, the lineup for this stream includes Silent Hill f, Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, Lego Voyagers, Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles, Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection, Mistfall Hunter and My Hero Academia: All's Justice. How to watch Hollow Knight: Silksong - Special Announcement — August 21, 10:30AM ET Watch on YouTube This is not a drill. Team Cherry has scheduled a \"special announcement\" for maybe the most anticipated and hyped-up game this side of Grand Theft Auto VI . The developer and publisher hasn't revealed exactly what it plans to announce regarding Hollow Knight: Silksong, but it's gotta be a release date, right ? A deeper dive into the game would be most welcome too. It's been six long years since we had some hands-on time with Hollow Knight: Silksong . However, Gamescom attendees will be able to try it out at the Microsoft and Nintendo booths on the show floor. I hope the two companies have lots of space to accommodate what are sure to be long lines. How to watch Awesome Indies — August 21, 12PM ET Watch on YouTube and Twitch The Indie Arena Booth will host more than 200 games for Gamescom attendees to check out, but you won't necessarily need to be there in person to see them. Many will be featured in an hour-long showcase called Awesome Indies. Here, we'll see \"exclusive trailers, first peeks at never-before-seen gameplay, amazing premieres and exciting newcomers,\" according to Gamescom. There are a lot of interesting games being featured at the booth, including Cairn and Strange Antiquities . I'm particularly hoping the showcase will include some more details about Ball x Pit , which is one of my most anticipated games right now, Militsioner and the creepy-looking Fractured Blooms . How to watch Bethesda broadcasts - August 22 Watch on Twitch There will be plenty from the Bethesda side of the Xbox division as well. The publisher will be broadcasting from the Xbox show floor at Gamescom for three days, starting on August 22. According to Microsoft , these streams will include \"developer interviews, game showcases, community segments, crafting highlights and live IRL tours.\" This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/how-to-watch-gamescom-2025-and-what-to-expect-120024733.html?src=rss", "ingested_utc": "2025-08-19T15:54:47Z"}

Team Cherry just announced a livestream for the long-anticipated sequel Hollow Knight: Silksong . It takes place on April 21 at 10:30AM ET. The company says it will be making a \"special announcement\" about the game. We don't exactly know what this announcement will be, but it's starting to feel like a release date or at least a release window. Rumors have been swirling that the title would finally be getting a release date during this week's Gamescom festivities , with Geoff Keighley offering a tease a couple of days ago . This is all happening more than six years after the game was first announced . It's possible that the special announcement won't involve the release date at all, but will instead offer new game modes or a deeper dive into the story. It's worth noting that reports have indicated that the game would finally see the light of day this year , though we've been fooled by that kind of thing before. For the uninitiated, Hollow Knight: Silksong is the followup to Hollow Knight , which was an indie Metroidvania that absolutely took the world by storm. It actually started as DLC for the original game before the developers realized the scope of their ambitions would take nearly seven years to see through.

Even though the company spent several years having other manufacturers build phones it could slap its \"Nexus\" branding on, selling hardware is not core to Google's business. Things like advertising and Search still handily dwarf the inroads the company's made as a smartphone manufacturer, and that will likely remain true for the foreseeable future. Compared to the contributions the iPhone makes to Apple's bottom line, the Pixel has always, in some sense, been a hobby. Which means Google finds itself in a familiar place heading into the launch of the Pixel 10 . It's better than it's ever been at the business of building phones, but the task for the Pixel remains the same: get people to use Google software (especially Search). The first smartphones \"made by Google\" Google sold its own hardware, including a lineup of phones, under the Nexus brand from 2010 to 2016 — but it was always known that hardware manufacturers like HTC and Samsung were actually building the hardware. That changed with the Pixel, the first time Google started using the now-ubiquitous \"made by Google\" phrasing. Ever since the first Pixel phone arrived in October 2016, Google’s phones have been defined by their camera skills. Google's significant breakthroughs in computational photography influenced the entire industry, and continue to do so today. The original Pixel and Pixel XL featured a single 12.3-megapixel camera and let anyone take great HDR photos without any fuss. Purchasing a Pixel or Pixel XL also unlocked unlimited full-resolution backups of your photos in Google Photos for free, a strong incentive to consider switching to Google's smartphone in its own right. The company's glass and aluminum phone was more than just its camera sensor, though. A big part of Google's early pitch for the Pixel, and other hardware like Google Home, was that it could serve as a vehicle for Google Assistant . The AI-powered voice assistant had shades of Siri, and voice control features previously available in Android. But it was far more integrated into Google's software and services and had a deep well of knowledge to draw on from Google Search. An \"OK Google\" could let you set a timer on your phone, but it could also answer trivia or tell you about an upcoming calendar event. Google continued to lean on software for the release of the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL , which put Google Now -style proactive information on a new always-on display, along with a refined design with pressure sensitive sides that could activate specific functions on the phone. In terms of the camera, Google's major improvements over the original Pixel were the addition of optical image stabilization for video and a custom imaging chip, dubbed the Pixel Visual Core , that handled the image processing for both first-party and third-party camera apps. Besides being the first instance of Google sneaking some of its own custom silicon into its phone, the Pixel 2 was also was a significant challenge to Apple's dominance in the photography department That pattern continued with the release of the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL , which again featured a slightly modified design, wireless charging and a collection of new camera features. The biggest was Night Sight, Google's software solution for taking really good photos when there’s barely any light available. The feature was released after the Pixel 3 came out, and gave the phone the ability to capture more or less light at night depending on the shakiness of your hand. The third-generation Pixel was also paired with the introduction of Google Assistant's Call Screen feature, a mixture of visual voicemail and audio transcription that allowed users to see why someone is calling and only pick up if they wanted to. Google would go on to introduce the first budget version of the Pixel a few months later with the Pixel 3a , a practice that continues to this day. In the following years, the company's releases were mostly memorable for gimmicks like the Pixel 4's Motion Sense feature (using radar to detect hand gestures to launch shortcuts) and the adoption of industry trends, with the Pixel 5's support for 5G . The company followed up those phones with a few releases that were only memorable for gimmicks like the Pixel 4's Motion Sense feature (essentially motion controls for specific apps) and the adoption of an industry trend, with the Pixel 5's 5G support . Say hello to the camera bar and Tensor chip It would take the radical new design of the Pixel 6 to snap things back into focus for Google. Not only did the Pixel 6 have a massive, shelf-like camera bar on the back, but the phone was also the first to be powered by a custom SoC developed by Google. Rather than focus on raw power, the Google Tensor chip was designed to handle on-device AI tasks like Magic Eraser for editing photos, Live Translate for converting text to another language as you type and Direct My Call, which lets the Pixel navigate phone trees on your behalf. The splashy launch of the Pixel 6 in 2021 marks the new path Google's smartphones have been heading for the last four years. They're still good at taking photos, but their main role is to be a showcase for whatever AI feature the company has cooked up most recently. Google continued to refine the idea with the release of the Pixel 7 , which was paired with the first Pixel Watch following Google's acquisition of Fitbit in 2021. 2023 brought the Pixel 8 as well as the company's first foldable, the Pixel Fold . The move also matched internal shifts at Google itself. The teams developing the Android operating system have long been separate from the teams building Pixel phones out of respect for Google's partners who make their own Android phones. That changed in 2024 when Google announced a reorganization that placed Pixel and Android under the same \"Platforms & Devices\" umbrella. The stated motivation was that aligning software and hardware would let the company release new AI features even faster, which bore out in the various Gemini features on the Pixel 9 lineup and whatever the company has planned for the Pixel 10. On some level the intimate role smartphones play in people's lives makes them an obvious venue for AI, something the company clearly wants to take advantage of based on in-development features like Project Astra . Google clearly experimented throughout the life of the Pixel, but the phone has always been a tool to sell software ideas. Demonstrating the potential of computational photography had early success, and now the company is trying to do the same thing with generative AI and Gemini. Competition remains fierce — OpenAI shared in December 2024 that ChatGPT had 300 million weekly users, making it a real threat to Google's core business. Google has never been a hardware company, nor has it needed to win at hardware. But with stiffer competition in software than ever, using the Pixel series to get people to use Google's many services is arguably more important than ever.

The company will build all four iPhone 17 models there, and for the first time US-bound shipments for the entire lineup will come from India at launch. The shift comes amid production expansion across five factories in India, including two plants that recently opened. Apple has been working to decrease its reliance on China for the manufacturing of US-bound iPhones. According to Bloomberg , factories controlled by Tata Group, an Indian multinational headquartered in Mumbai, will account for as much as half of India’s iPhone output over the next two years. Apple’s longtime partner Foxconn Technology Group is also involved through its production hub in Bangalore. The iPhone 17 lineup is expected to be unveiled in September, though the exact date is still unknown. We expect to see the usual iPhone 17, 17 Pro, and 17 Pro Max models announced, with the added possibility of a slimmer premium model in the form of an iPhone Air. The iPhone 17e, the next generation of Apple's budget-friendly model, is more likely to arrive in early 2026 if it follows the same pattern as the iPhone 16e . In the United States, the Trump administration had threatened Apple with tariffs on iPhones if it continued manufacturing the devices overseas. More recently, however, Apple announced from the Oval Office that it would invest an additional $100 billion in the US as part of a new “American Manufacturing Program.” This was announced as part of a $600 billion overall investment by Apple to produce more components domestically. While India is among the many countries facing the Trump administration’s ever-changing tariff landscape, Bloomberg reported earlier this summer that iPhones imported from India have so far evaded tariffs as the US Commerce Department works to determine what sectors it deems vital to national security. With that in mind, it’s not surprising to see Apple shipping as many iPhones to the US from India as possible, at least for now.

It will reportedly be based on the company's latest Blackwell architecture , which can produce chips between seven and 30 times faster than its previous AI platform. Reuters says the product is tentatively named B30A and will have a single-die design, putting all its main components on a single piece of silicon. It will apparently be capable of half the computing power of NVIDIA's Blackwell Ultra GPUs , which have dual-die configuration. The product will also come with high-bandwidth memory and the company's NVLink technology for speedier data transmission between processors. It's possible that NVIDIA is developing the chip after the Chinese government discouraged local companies from using the H20, especially for government and national security purposes. Chinese regulators even reportedly ordered big tech corporations, including Alibaba, Bytedance and Tencent, to suspend their purchases from NVIDIA until the government is done with a national security review. China's warning to local companies came after the US government lifted its export restriction on the company's H20 chips. If you'll recall, the US blocked the company from selling its H20 chips to China back in April over concerns that the Chinese military could use the chips to develop AI technology. In July, NVIDIA announced that the government has assured the company that it will approve licenses to ship and export H20 chips to China. The Financial Times then reported in August that the government had agreed to grant NVIDIA (and AMP) export licenses in exchange for 15 percent of their profits. Reuters says NVIDIA is still finalizing the specs of B30A, but it's hoping to deliver samples to Chinese clients for testing as soon as September this year. Trump seems to already be aware that NVIDIA is working on a chip based on Blackwell for the Chinese market, but whether it gets regulatory and export approval remains to be seen: The president told reporters that NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huan is \"coming to see [him] again about that.\" This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/nvidia-is-reportedly-developing-an-ai-chip-for-china-more-powerful-than-the-h20-130057520.html?src=rss", "ingested_utc": "2025-08-19T13:40:29Z"}

Luckily, NordVPN sits in the latter category, and right now Nord is offering discounted plans across its various tiers. If you take out a two-year NordVPN Plus plan (the company's most popular plan) it’ll cost you $108 for the duration of the contract, with Nord throwing in three extra months at no extra cost. That’s 73 percent off the usual rate. As well as Nord’s VPN service, a Plus plan also includes the Threat Protection Pro anti-malware tool, password management and an ad- and tracker-blocker. A Prime plan additionally comes with encrypted cloud storage or NordProtect, which insures you against identity theft and monitors dark web activity. That's also on sale — down to $189 on the same two-year commitment with those three additional months thrown in, which works out to a 77 percent savings on the regular price. When Engadget’s Sam Chapman reviewed NordVPN earlier this year, he praised its excellent download speeds, exclusive features and extensive server network. Less impressive is its clunky interface and inconsistent design when jumping between different platforms running a NordVPN app. While it doesn't quite make the cut in our guide to the best VPNs available right now, it generally performed well in speed tests and Threat Protection Pro is really worth having.

Compared to its predecessor, the new Snapdragon chips have overall improved performance, support for more detailed displays and a feature that allows for better video quality in low-light situations. We were able to test the Snapdragon 7s Gen 3 with smartphones like the Nothing 3a and 3a Pro , but this next-gen chipset represents a seven percent improvement with both the Qualcomm Adreno GPU and Kryo CPU. The Gen 4 specs also show higher peak CPU speeds of up to 2.7 GHz, compared to the previous generation's 2.5 GHz. On top of the overall performance boost, Qualcomm added support for WFHD+ displays that have a 2,900 x 1,300 resolution and a 144Hz refresh rate. For better video in dark scenarios, Qualcomm infused the Snapdragon 7s Gen 4 with the Low Light Vision feature, which was previously reserved for the company's more expensive chips. Beyond these upgrades, the fourth-generation Snapdragon 7s chips keep the AI-powered ability to take 200-megapixel photos, Qualcomm's Quick Charge 4+ Technology that can recharge a device from zero to 50 percent in five minutes and support for real-time translation and transcription with multiple languages. It's a minor upgrade from the Snapdragon 7s Gen 3 that was announced last August and Qualcomm hasn't announced any phone makers who plan to use this chip yet. However, we could see the latest chip being used by companies like Honor and Vivo, who previously used Qualcomm's Snapdragon 7 Gen 3 models.

In fact, it's safe to say the format isn't going away anytime soon, with Adobe reporting there are 3 trillion PDFs in circulation worldwide. However, there's no denying they can be a pain to work with, and in an effort to make it easier to manage projects involving multiple PDFs, Adobe is launching a new product today called Acrobat Studio. And wouldn't you know it, the company is marketing the inclusion of generative AI tools as a major selling point of the suite. The main feature of Acrobat Studio are hubs Adobe calls PDF Spaces. Here, you can upload up to 100 files — including PDFs of course, alongside public web pages, RTFs, DOCXs and more — and Acrobat Studio's built-in AI assistants will help you make sense of everything. To start, the hub will generate a summary of all the documents, with a few pre-populated prompts to help with further analysis. Accompanying each bullet point from the AI is a citation you can use to verify the model's summary by quickly jumping to the document it pulled the information from. Sharing your PDF Spaces with colleagues is built right into Acrobat Studio. In addition to chatting with Acrobat Studio's AI assistant, you can create custom assistants to carry out specific tasks. By default, Adobe offers three of these — analyst, instructor and entertainer — to get you started. The names do a decent job of communicating each assistant's purpose. For example, the instructor will attempt to explain complex topics. You can create your own by writing a set of custom prompts. There are some notable limitations to PDF Spaces. For one, the hub's generative AI features currently only work with documents written in English. Adobe says it will add support for other languages \"over time.\" Similarly, the hub can't analyze videos, handwritten notes and password-protected files. Outside of PDF Spaces, Acrobat Studio offers access to Adobe Express built right into the app, meaning you can use Adobe's Firefly AI models to generate commercially safe images for your PDFs. As you would expect, the suite also comes with Adobe Acrobat and all the tools you might need to create and edit your own protected documents. Pricing for Acrobat Studio starts at $25 per month for individuals, with a 14-day trial available.

One of the more charming peripherals, the HORI Piranha Plant camera, is on sale right now for only $40. That's $20 off and a record-low price. It's a good deal for anyone who wants to take advantage of the Switch 2's camera functionality in games like Mario Kart World and that recently-released campfire sim . This was designed specifically for Nintendo's new console, so it's a plug-and-play affair. It's actually cheaper than the official Switch 2 camera with this sale and it looks a whole lot cooler. It's a Piranha Plant from the Mario franchise. We called it a \"work of art\" upon encountering the device and that holds true today. This thing is not only stylish, resembling an Amiibo more than a camera, but it's downright useful. The pot the Piranha Plant sits in functions as both a stand and USB extension for the device. The plant itself detaches from the pot, so the camera can be used in portable mode by popping it into the USB port at the top of the console. There's also a built-in privacy shutter. Just close the plant's mouth to obscure the lens. The actual camera specs here aren't going to win any awards, with a frame rate of 30FPS and a resolution of 640 x 480p. However, that's more than enough to capture footage of your floating head to accompany your kart as it races through the Mushroom Kingdom.

The company is now selling an almost $350 retrofit turn signal stalk for its Model 3 cars after removing from the initial model. Instead, it used buttons to activate the turn signal. As of now, the add-on is only available in the Chinese market. But, Model 3 drivers will need to shell out another 2,499 yuan ($348) to get a normal part of almost every car. However, there's a slight catch: The turn signal stalk is only compatible with models produced from February 7 of this year onward. Only one month earlier, Tesla launched a refreshed Model Y that brought back the turn signal stalk. \"We always say at Tesla, if you aren’t deleting so much that you have to put something back, you have’t deleted enough. Well, maybe we deleted too much,\" Tesla's vice president of engineering Lars Moravy said in an interview with Jay Leno shortly after. The option to buy a retrofit signal stalk isn't that surprising. Creator Chris Zheng first leaked the news back in February on X (formerly Twitter). It's unclear whether Tesla plans to bring the add-on to additional markets.

That’s a not-insignificant 32 percent off the usual $249 price of the noise-canceling in-ears. Apple’s flagship AirPods were $100 off — a record-low $149 — during Prime Day, so we have seen them even cheaper than this, but for a non-sale period, Amazon’s current deal is worth considering. The AirPods Pro 2 are our top choice for iPhone users looking for wireless earbuds, thanks to much beefier sound than the original model, rock solid ANC and transparency modes, and seamless switching between Apple devices. Throw in spatial audio support, hands-free Siri and more than acceptable battery life, and the AirPods Pro 2 are hard to top. Not everyone gets on with the sometimes fiddly touch gestures, but a lot of wireless headphones struggle with this. If there’s anything to give you pause, it’s that we might be getting the AirPods Pro 3 sooner rather than later. But if that’s the case, you can be confident you’ll pay a lot more than $169 for the privilege. The AirPods Pro aren’t the only discounted AirPods right now. The AirPods 4 (without ANC) are down to $99. Usually priced at $129, you’re saving $30 on a much improved entry-level AirPods offering. They fit and sound better than any non-Pro AirPods before them, and inherit some previously Pro-only features thanks to the H2 chip. If you travel a lot you’ll also certainly rue the lack of ANC, but if that isn’t a deal breaker for you, the $99 price point might be tempting.

With that, ChatGPT Plus and ChatGPT Pro are now offered for 1,999 rupees ($22.95) and 19,990 rupees ($229.50) — more expensive than the $20 and $200 users paid prior to the local currency rollout. ChatGPT Go now gives local users a more budget-oriented option. However, it doesn't offer access to GPT-5's advanced reasoning, has \"limited deep research,\" no custom GPTs and lower message, image and file upload limits compared to the higher-end subscriptions, according to OpenAI's plan page in India . India is a key market for OpenAI, being second only to the US by user base. CEO Sam Altman recently met with India's IT minister about a plan to introduce lower-cost AI plans. According to Turley's X post, it looks like ChatGPT Go will come to other countries soon, though the company has yet to say which ones.

It’s not as crazy as it sounds. REUTERS / Reuters NASA is considering a small nuclear reactor for the Moon, to power a possibly permanent lunar presence. Other power sources have their drawbacks: Solar power is limited by the long two-week lunar nights and sunless craters, making nuclear energy a more reliable and constant power source. A nuclear reactor would also provide a significant amount of energy from a small mass, which is crucial for space travel. Challenges remain, including the system’s weight, recent cuts at NASA and the lack of a US company to produce the microreactor itself. Continue reading.

The Outlander Electric is designed to be “whisper quiet” for tasks like herding or hunting, but it can still tow more than its gas-powered counterparts, thanks to the high level of torque. The 8.9 kWh battery will offer around 50 miles (80km) of range, which is half that of a gasoline ATV, depending on the model. The Can-Am Outlander Electric ATV is now available from dealers and Can-Am’s website, starting at $12,999. Continue reading.

The law gives the UK government the right to compel companies to turn over data to law enforcement and intelligence agencies. Reports about the mandate started to come out in February, however, and Apple pretty much confirmed it when it disabled iCloud's Advanced Data Protection feature in the UK. ADP gives users the power to to add optional end-to-end encryption to a variety of iCloud data, which means the information can't be accessed by authorities unless they have the user's device in their hands. \"As we have said many times before, we have never built a backdoor or master key to any of our products or services and we never will,\" Apple said at the time. A bipartisan group of US lawmakers asked Gabbard to take measures to prevent what they called \"a foreign cyberattack waged through political means\" after the information about the mandate went public. Meanwhile, Apple filed a complained with the Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT), which \"investigates complaints about the alleged conduct of public bodies in relation to members of the public,\" to get the order reversed. The company has yet to issue an official statement about the reversal of the UK mandate.

Starting today, premium users will have access to a new tool for creating customized transitions within playlists. This will allow seamless progression from one track to the next, with natural-sounding changeovers and no awkward silence. Once you've created a playlist, you'll notice a Mix option on the toolbar. When selected, the tool gives you the option to pick Auto and allow Spotify to instantly make the transitions, or you can tap in further to customize things as you see fit. From there, you can choose presets like Fade or Rise to quickly apply transition styles or try specific changes to volume, EQ and effects. The app will display a waveform for the two songs, helping you select the best place to make the swap. After making your transitions, you can save them for future use or for sharing with friends. And speaking of friends, the transition editor is available for collaboration on any playlists you build with your pals. Spotify allows you to toggle the Mix option on and off at any time, so you're free to listen without any of that creative customization if needed. To help you create a playlist that's ready for mixing, Spotify will show you the tempo in BPMs (beats per minute) and Camelot keys for each song once you tap Mix. The company reminds users that the best options for this tool are songs that were created for seamless transitions, so genres like house and techno will provide the best results. Spotify also recommends using the Mix tool for making running playlists with consistent BPMs to help with pace or to create roadtrip playlists that can maintain \"the vibe.\" Lastly, you can create your own cover art for mixed playlists using Spotify's built-in editor that debuted last fall.

Companies like Ooni have popularized the ability to make restaurant-quality pies at home by giving you ovens that get hot enough for various pizza styles. Some burn wood while others run on gas, and some options can even do both with the proper accessories. I’ve broken down what to look for when you’re shopping for a pizza oven along with my top picks for the best pizza oven in various categories. If you prefer to stay in your kitchen, I’ve got options for you too. Plus, there’s a list of the pizza ovens on my upcoming slate of reviews. Table of contents Best outdoor pizza ovens for 2025 Best indoor pizza ovens in 2025 What to look for in a pizza oven How to prepare before outdoor cooking Upcoming pizza oven reviews The best pizza accessories for the oven you already have Best outdoor pizza ovens for 2025 Best indoor pizza ovens in 2025 Let me preface this section by saying you probably already have an indoor option that you can use to make some great pizza. Whether that’s the main oven in your kitchen or a multi-function countertop unit, with some affordable accessories, you can easily up your game without spending $1,000 on a dedicated appliance. For example, my Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer has a convection pizza setting that automatically adjusts cook time based on the size, oven temperature and whether the pie is fresh or frozen. A key consideration here is size. These things are massive, about the size of a large microwave, so you likely won’t want to keep them out all the time unless you have a huge kitchen. What to look for in a pizza oven When shopping for a home oven or dedicated pizza oven, you’ll first want to consider what types of pies you plan to make. Most portable pizza ovens from the likes of Ooni, Solo Stove and others use wood burning fuel and are primarily designed for the high-heat cooking required for light and airy Neapolitan-style pizzas. We’re talking high temperatures up to 900 degrees Fahrenheit. These units can certainly cook different styles of pizza at cooler temperatures, but the learning curve is easiest when you’re running them wide open with a full load of wood. You'll also want to consider alternate fuel types. If you purchase a propane or natural gas burner, you can adjust temperatures easily by turning a knob. For this reason, I recommend you spend the extra $100 or so on that accessory. This dual-fuel option makes your pizza oven a lot more versatile and gives you the option to still have a freshly fired pie when you don’t feel like messing with wood or charcoal. If you only want to cook with gas, there are models available that only use propane or natural gas. The other key consideration for aspiring pizza makers is size. Most companies make ovens that fit 12-inch pizzas, a perfect size for a personal pan pizza. They’re also great for pizza parties, since people can customize their own without having to pick off toppings they don’t like. If you want to make larger pizzas or plan to use your oven for other things (pans, etc), consider a larger version that can accommodate more than just small pies. The interior dimensions – or at the very least the pizza stone size – will be listed on most product pages. How to prepare before outdoor cooking Making good pizza at home requires a considerable amount of counter or table space. You’ll need room to stretch and prep your pizza dough, lay out your mozzarella, other cheeses and toppings and load pies onto a peel. Of course, some folks will be comfortable working in the tight confines of a small kitchen, but I’ve found it much easier to use extra space to make sure I’m not constantly moving things around during the various steps in the process. It’s also less hassle to set up your pizza-making station in close proximity to your oven. As a pizza-baking beginner, I did the running back and forth from the kitchen to the back porch. It’s far from ideal. It’s difficult to maintain your fire (if using wood or charcoal) when you’re unable to watch it closely. The good news is a patio table can be easily converted into a pizza station with a large cutting board. This also gets your oven off the ground so it’s easier to access. Ooni sells tables for its ovens that also offer shelving and storage for peels and other accessories. Solo Stove has a rolling stand for its Pi oven too, with small side shelves and a spot for your propane tank underneath. Of course, you can find other tables and stands to suit your needs, just make sure they can withstand any heat that may radiate from the bottom of the oven while cooking. Most ovens are either well insulated or don’t project too much excess heat toward the table, but you can never be too careful. For that reason, a stainless steel or metal surface is a good choice to set up an outdoor model. Most of these ovens heat up quickly and cook at high temperatures, especially if you’re making Neapolitan pizza. Having everything you need nearby so you can keep tabs on the oven and quickly make the next pie — especially the first pizza — will ease a lot of unnecessary headaches. When your cook time is two minutes or less, you don’t want to venture too far. The best pizza accessories for the oven you already have If you want to make a good pizza that rivals that of your favorite pizzeria (and without spending hundreds of dollars on a dedicated oven), you can definitely do it with the home oven you already have in your kitchen. With a few gadgets, you can improve your game without splurging on a Breville, Ooni or Solo Stove. First, I’d recommend a high quality baking steel or stone. Baking stones are great for getting better browning on the bottom of your pies than a pizza or sheet pan. You can also use them for bread, cookies and other items. The stone absorbs heat to cook pizza quickly, so you don’t need to worry about preheating it, and you’ll get that charred crust like a brick oven provides. They’re also more affordable compared to baking steels . Those metal slabs do have one key advantage: higher heat conductivity. This means a steel will cook your pizzas faster since it can absorb more heat from your oven. While baking steels can be used as griddles on your stovetop and for other types of baking, they’re not ideal for some leavened breads. The second item you’ll want is a pizza peel . These come in all shapes and sizes, made out of a variety of materials. I typically use a bamboo or wooden peel when topping and launching my pizzas and then a metal one for retrieving them. I’ve found that dough doesn’t stick as easily to bamboo during prep and the metal resists the high heat of the oven when turning or retrieving a finished pizza (bamboo will burn). There are also perforated peels which allow both steam and excess flour to escape. A peel is a great tool for loading and turning pizzas, getting them in the back of the oven, and since you’ll typically be cooking them with your oven at 500 degrees or hotter, using something like parchment paper to move them around won’t work. And if you’re going for a New York style pizza, just make sure your dough recipe and ingredients are geared toward that thinner, crispy crust — the right accessories alone won’t be enough.

While people have been gaming on the go since the halcyon days of the Game Boy, recent years have brought an avalanche of devices that let you play all sorts of games anywhere you want. But new machines seem to arrive every week, and figuring out which ones are actually worth buying can be overwhelming. Depending on your tastes, the right handheld could be a $70 emulator or an $800 portable PC. To help you narrow things down, we’ve spent months researching the best handheld gaming consoles and testing several top contenders. Here are the ones we like the most right now. Editor’s note (8/19/25) : This is a somewhat awkward time to buy a gaming handheld, as new machines based on AMD’s Ryzen Z2 Extreme chip are on the way, including two new Xbox handhelds developed by Microsoft and ASUS. Those Xbox devices will bring an overhauled Windows UI that could address many of our longstanding issues with the OS. Beyond that, the Trump administration’s tariff policy and proposed repeal of the “ de minimis ” exemption continues to loom over the handheld market, potentially hiking the prices of retro handhelds built by Chinese companies in particular (among many other goods). Nevertheless, we’ve updated this guide with a new pick and stand by our current recommendations for those looking to buy a new gaming handheld today. Table of contents Best handheld gaming devices for 2025 What about the Nintendo Switch 2? Other gaming handhelds we've tested What to know about the gaming handheld market Best handheld gaming devices for 2025 What about the Nintendo Switch 2? Sam Rutherford for Engadget Read our full Nintendo Switch 2 review The new Nintendo Switch 2 is already more popular than any of the handhelds above, but we haven’t made it a formal pick in this guide since it exists in its own world. As one of the newest devices from the big three console manufacturers, most people aren’t choosing between it and the handheld PCs or emulation devices above. The main reason to buy a Switch 2 is to play new Nintendo games, and no other device can (legally) offer that. Likewise, the Switch 2 doesn’t even try to offer the flexibility of a Steam Deck, ROG Ally X or even the Retroid Pocket 5. That said, the hardware itself is a significant upgrade over its predecessor, with dramatically improved performance, a sharper, faster and bigger 7.9-inch display, magnetic Joy-Con controllers and more storage. It’s a wholly more polished take on the Switch 1’s ideas. Does that make it a must-buy right now? Unless you’re worried about a tariff-induced price hike — which may not be the most outlandish fear — not really. Donkey Kong Bananza is a joy, Mario Kart World is fun enough and playing Cyberpunk 2077 on a Nintendo console is kind of surreal, but the list of true must-plays that are exclusive to the Switch 2 is still very limited. That’s OK — it’s only been two months. But don’t feel the need to rush out and splash the cash today unless you have a serious case of Donkey Kong -induced FOMO. Other gaming handhelds we've tested The MSI Claw 8 AI+. Sam Rutherford for Engadget Note: This is a selection of noteworthy gaming handhelds we’ve tested, not a comprehensive list of everything we've ever tried. MSI Claw 8 AI+ The original MSI Claw was a flop , but the newer Claw 8 AI+ is much more appealing if you’re willing to pay for a larger and slightly more powerful alternative to the ASUS ROG Ally X. With its Intel Core Ultra 7-258V chip and 32GB of RAM, it typically pumped out 10 to 15 percent higher frame rates than other high-end models like the Ally X and Lenovo Legion Go in our testing. Battery life is relatively strong, while its 8-inch 120Hz IPS display is plenty bright and supports VRR. There are smooth Hall effect thumbsticks and triggers, two Thunderbolt 4 ports and a built-in fingerprint sensor beyond that. The Claw’s main issue is its price: At $1,000 after a recent price hike, it’s hard to justify over the ROG Ally X, which is already too expensive for most people. ASUS' handheld is smaller, lighter and generally more portable on top of that— though the Claw is thinner — and its Armoury Crate software, while far from perfect, is still a bit more polished than MSI’s Center M hub. There's also a smaller 7-inch version of this handheld for $900, but we haven’t tested that one. The Lenovo Legion Go. Photo by Sam Rutherford/Engadget Lenovo Legion Go The Lenovo Legion Go is another capable alternative to the ASUS ROG Ally X with an even larger display. It runs on the same Ryzen Z1 Extreme chip and offers a similar set of performance modes, but it has a mondo-sized 8.8-inch panel with a sharper 2,560 x 1,600 resolution and a higher 144Hz refresh rate. It also borrows some ideas from the Switch, including detachable controllers and a built-in kickstand for playing games in a tabletop mode. Those controllers have touchpads to make navigating Windows a little easier, something the ROG Ally X lacks. But it’s still a Windows handheld, and Lenovo’s software tweaks aren’t as intuitive as what ASUS has done with Armoury Crate, so the UX can feel half-baked by comparison. The jumbo design is bulkier and heavier than the ROG Ally X, so some will find it too fatiguing to hold. Its fans are louder as well, plus the display lacks VRR. Lenovo teased a Legion Go 2 at CES earlier this year, which looks promising and should arrive in the coming months. The Lenovo Legion Go S. Sam Rutherford for Engadget Lenovo Legion Go S (Windows, Z2 Go chip) The Windows 11 version of the Lenovo Legion Go S has the same relatively comfortable design and commendable 8-inch 120Hz display as the SteamOS model we highlight above. With the Z2 Go model we tested, though, its performance lags too far behind the ROG Ally X, Claw 8 AI+ and original Legion Go for something priced at $730. Windows is still clunky, too. The Ayaneo Flip DS. Photo by Jeff Dunn / Engadget Ayaneo Flip DS The Ayaneo Flip DS is a cool concept: a powerful Windows machine with a clamshell design and dual displays, sort of like a supercharged Nintendo DS. It feels sturdy, it performs roughly on par with the other Ryzen 7 7840U (or 8840U) handhelds in this guide, and its 7-inch top display is sharp, fast and bright. The second screen makes it a natural fit for emulating Wii U or 3DS games, but you could also, say, look up a guide or play a YouTube video without having to close whatever you’re playing. Unfortunately, this is more of a neat idea than a fully thought-out product. The folding design means that the joysticks have to be short and recessed, while the face buttons and d-pad are uncomfortably flat. The whole thing is overly thick and heavy, plus it runs very hot. Battery life tops out around two hours, and actually managing two displays on a Windows handheld is about as clunky as you'd expect. With prices now starting above $1,000, the Flip DS is hard to recommend unless you’re (oddly) desperate for a handheld Wii U emulator. We're always happy to see more weird hardware, though. The Ayaneo Kun. Photo by James Trew / Engadget Ayaneo Kun The Ayaneo Kun is among the most decadent Windows handhelds we’ve tested. With a sharp 8.4-inch display, a Ryzen 7 8840U chip, up to 64GB of RAM, up to 4TB of storage, a sizable 75Whr battery and a 54W max TDP, it’s both a capable gaming device and a feasible replacement for a desktop PC. But it now starts at a pricey $999, it’s huge and it suffers from the usual Windows-related issues. It also lacks VRR. It’s still a fine device if money is truly no object, but it’s more handheld than most need. The ROG Ally X is a much better value. This is technically an older model for Ayaneo, too, as the company seems to launch a new handheld every other hour these days. Ayaneo 2S The Ayaneo 2S is another high-power Windows handheld with a sharper display and higher configuration options than the ROG Ally X. It also uses the same chip as the Kun above. But it’s limited to a 60Hz refresh rate and costs a few hundred dollars extra. Ayaneo announced a decked-out successor called the Ayaneo 3 toward the end of 2024; we'll try to test that one out in the future. The Retroid Pocket Mini (bottom) and Retroid Pocket 5. Jeff Dunn for Engadget Retroid Pocket Mini The Retroid Pocket Mini is essentially a smaller version of the Retroid Pocket 5. It runs on the same Snapdragon 865 chip and feels just as sturdy, but it has a smaller 3.92-inch display with a 4:3 aspect ratio. This makes it a more natural fit for older retro consoles, as you won’t get the black boxes you’d see on a 16:9 display like the one on the Pocket 5. If you mainly want to emulate systems like the SNES, Sega Genesis or Game Boy Color and don’t mind paying extra for a rich OLED display, it’s a good little device. But the tiny screen is limiting if you ever want to play newer games, and we wish there wasn't so much empty space around the display. This device had also generated some controversy within the retro gaming community for having persistent issues with inaccurate shaders (and for the slapdash way Retroid handled the matter). The company replaced the original model with a \"V2\" iteration that addresses those concerns, however. Retroid Pocket 4 Pro and Retroid Pocket 4 The 4.7-inch Retroid Pocket 4 Pro is the predecessor to the Pocket 5. Its performance isn’t significantly far off the newer model, so it remains a nice value if you’re determined to spend less than $200 on an emulation device. It misses out on the larger OLED display and more ergonomically-friendly design of its follow-up, however. The base Pocket 4 may also be worth a look if you want to stay under $150, but its weaker chip makes it less adept at emulating games from the PS2, GameCube and up. The Anbernic RG35XX Plus. Photo by Jeff Dunn / Engadget Miyoo Mini Plus The Miyoo Mini Plus is a highly affordable handheld with a well-built, Game Boy-style form factor that fits nicely with older games. Its 3.5-inch display really pops for something in the $60 to $80 range, its battery lasts as long as it needs to and it can emulate consoles up to the original PlayStation without much issue. Its Linux-based software is extensively customizable , though it requires some tinkering to get it working optimally. Like many cheapo handhelds, it also lacks fast charging. Still, of the many Game Boy-like emulation devices floating around the budget end of the market, it’s the one we’d recommend first. Since it’s from a smaller Chinese firm and isn’t available at major retailers, however, it can be difficult to actually buy. Anbernic RG35XX Plus The Anbernic RG35XX Plus is another wallet-friendly vertical handheld — or at least, it was before Anbernic paused shipments to the US. For about the same price as the Miyoo Mini Plus, it offers a faster chipset, more RAM and a bigger battery alongside a similarly impressive design. Its stock OS is overly sloppy and cheap-looking, however, and while the stronger processor is nice, the small screen and lack of analog sticks means you won’t want to emulate much beyond the PS1 anyway. The Anbernic RG35XXSP. Jeff Dunn for Engadget Anbernic RG35XXSP The Anbernic RG35XXSP is a variant of the RG35XX Plus based on the same internals, only it apes the clamshell form factor of the old Game Boy Advance SP . That’s a great design to rip off if you must pick one, and the hardware doesn’t feel nearly as cheap as its (pre-tariff) price tag of $60 or so would suggest. But the software issues noted above still apply (both here and with the many other devices in the same RGXX family). We’ve also seen several user reports of quality control issues with the RG35XXSP’s battery, which is automatically disqualifying. Anbernic RG405M The Anbernic RG405M is another 4:3 handheld with a 4-inch display and a pleasing metal frame. It's an OK alternative to the Retroid Pocket Mini if you want a little more screen space for less cash, but it’s slower, and it lacks the Mini’s OLED display. We find the Retroid’s grooved back to be comfier to hold over time as well. And again, Anbernic has paused handheld shipments to America as of this writing. The PlayStation Portal. Photo by Devindra Hardawar/Engadget PlayStation Portal The PlayStation Portal is an odd accessory that’s designed to stream games from a PlayStation 5. It lacks built-in apps, so it doesn’t support traditional emulation. Because it’s entirely dependent on the quality of your home Wi-Fi, we can’t guarantee how well it’ll actually perform. It doesn’t work with Bluetooth earbuds either. The 8-inch display is fine and the DualSense-style controls are great, so PlayStation diehards who want a second screen for local PS5 streaming may see the appeal. Sony recently added the ability to stream a selection of games via the cloud , which is a step in the right direction, but you need an expensive PlayStation Plus Premium subscription to take advantage. In general, there’s little here that you can’t do with a smartphone and mobile game controller , so most people are better off saving their $200. Logitech G Cloud The Logitech G Cloud would’ve been a great Android pick when it launched if it cost about $150 less. Its 7-inch 1080p display is bright, vibrant and generally more pleasing to look at than the panel on the AYN Odin 2, its battery lasts a good 10 to 12 hours per charge and its design is comfy to hold for hours at a time. Alas, the G Cloud still tends to cost between $260 and $300, which is just too much when the Retroid Pocket 5 offers more power at a lower price. What to know about the gaming handheld market Jeff Dunn / Engadget You can break down the gaming handheld market into three broad tiers. At the top, you have x86-based portable gaming PCs like the Steam Deck or ASUS ROG Ally X . These are the most powerful handhelds you can buy, as they seek to replicate the experience of a moderately specced gaming desktop. The Steam Deck runs on the Linux operating system, but most others use Windows. If you want to play modern, recently released PC games on the go (and need something stronger than a Switch), this is the type of device you’d get. They can also emulate the widest range of retro consoles. They’re typically the largest and most cumbersome devices to hold, however, and their battery life can be short. Naturally, they’re also the most expensive, costing anywhere from $400 to more than $1,000. Further down on the price spectrum are \"mobile handhelds\" like the Logitech G Cloud or Retroid Pocket . These devices often run Android or Linux and can range from under $50 to $400-ish (before tariffs). They aren’t equipped to play modern console or PC titles, but they’re usually more compact than a portable PC, and you can still use them for mobile games and cloud streaming. While most are marketed toward those ends, many gamers actually buy them to emulate classic games through software like RetroArch . Getting emulators to work can be complicated , and accessing the BIOS and ROM files required to play games this way is legally murky . One lawsuit from Nintendo led to the shutdown of the most prominent Switch and 3DS emulators , for instance. (Engadget does not condone piracy.) Backing up files of games you already own for personal use only is considered more defensible, though, so for that a mobile handheld can be a more user- and wallet-friendly way to play the classics — provided you don’t want to just use your phone . We’ll call the last tier “handhelds that do their own thing.” This is a catch-all for things like the Switch 2 or Playdate : portable devices that run heavily customized software and aim to provide a unique gaming experience. They aren’t necessarily ideal for emulation or playing the latest multiplatform titles; instead, they often have distinct game libraries. They might not have the widest appeal as a result (Switch excluded), but they’re often easier for less tech-literate folks to just pick up and use. Recent updates August 2025 : We’ve added the SteamOS version of the Lenovo Legion Go S as a new recommendation and updated our top Windows pick to reflect the upcoming release of ASUS’ and Microsoft’s ROG Xbox Ally devices , which will feature an overhauled Windows UI. We’ve also added a note on the recently released Nintendo Switch 2. We’ll include testing notes on the Retroid Pocket Classic , TrimUI Brick and ModRetro Chromatic in the near future. (Note: Yours truly went on paternity leave after our last update — apologies for the delay!) May 2025 : We’ve tested the Retroid Pocket Flip 2 and recommended it as an alternative to the Retroid Pocket 5. We’re also watching out for the first third-party devices that run SteamOS, starting with the new Lenovo Legion Go S , and the next ASUS ROG Ally device, which seems to be arriving soon based on recent leaks . March 2025 : We’ve edited this guide for clarity and added testing notes for the MSI Claw 8 AI+ and Lenovo Legion Go S (Windows version). Our main picks are unchanged. Looking ahead, we’re keeping an eye on upcoming Windows handhelds from Acer and Ayaneo , a pair of new emulation devices from Retroid, the first third-party devices to ship with SteamOS and more machines that run on AMD’s Ryzen Z2 chips , among others. January 2025 : We have a new top pick among emulation-focused handhelds: the Retroid Pocket 5. Beyond that, we’ve added notes on a few other devices we’ve tested, including the Retroid Pocket Mini and Anbernic RG35XXSP; lightly edited other blurbs to reflect changes in the market; and removed a couple write-ups for products that’ve been discontinued. We're also keeping an eye on new handhelds that’ve recently been announced or are strongly rumored to arrive in the near future, including devices from MSI and Lenovo . August 2024 : We’ve replaced the ASUS ROG Ally, our prior pick for the best Windows gaming handheld, with the new and improved ROG Ally X. We’ve also checked to make sure all availability and pricing details noted throughout the guide are accurate. June 2024 : We’ve updated this guide to ensure all of our recommendations are up to date, adding a note on ASUS’ upcoming ROG Ally X in the process. We’ve also included details on two new handhelds we’ve tested since our previous update: the MSI Claw and Ayaneo Flip DS . Staying on top of this market is a tall task, but we’re currently looking at recent noteworthy releases like the PSP-esque AYN Odin 2 Mini and the GBA-style Anbernic RG35XXSP as well.

Vladimir Putin has agreed to face-to-face talks with Volodymyr Zelenskyy, according to Donald Trump and European leaders, although the Kremlin has yet to confirm a meeting will take place. German chancellor Friedrich Merz said Putin told Trump in a call during the White House meeting that he was ready to meet Zelenskyy “within the next two weeks” . Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov said Putin and Trump only discussed the “idea” of direct Russia-Ukraine talks in Monday’s phone call. Trump told Zelenskyy the US would help guarantee Ukraine’s security in any deal to end the war , though the extent of any assistance was not immediately clear. “I believe this is a major step forward,” Zelenskyy said, also saying security guarantees for Ukraine would probably be worked out within 10 days. The US president ruled out a ceasefire in the Russia-Ukraine war during a meeting with Zelenskyy and European leaders at the White House , despite last week warning Moscow of “very severe consequences” if Vladimir Putin didn’t agree to halt the fighting. Trump said while sitting with the leaders on Monday: “All of us would obviously prefer an immediate ceasefire while we work on a lasting peace. Maybe something like that could happen. As of this moment, it’s not happening.” Trump described his meeting with Zelenskyy and the leaders of Britain, Germany, France, Italy, Finland, the European Union and Nato as “a very good, early step for a war that has been going on for almost four years”. He also said on social media that vice-president JD Vance, secretary of state Marco Rubio and special envoy Steve Witkoff were “coordinating with Russia and Ukraine”. “Everyone is very happy about the possibility of peace for Russia/Ukraine,” Trump said. French president Emmanuel Macron called for stepping up sanctions against Russia if Putin does not move forward on peace with Ukraine . Merz said Ukraine should not be forced to surrender its Donbas region to Russia in talks, likening it to the US giving up Florida. Trump, however, seemed clearly swayed by Putin from their talks in Alaska last Friday and echoed the Russian president’s talking points , saying several times on Monday that ending the war was “up to” both Zelenskyy and Putin – rather than just Putin, who invaded Ukraine. Trump also said: “We also need to discuss the possible exchanges of territory, taking into consideration the current line of contact – that means the war zone .” Ukraine will promise to buy $90bn of US weapons financed by Europe as part of a deal to get guarantees from the US for its security if there is a peace settlement with Russia, Zelenskyy said. “There indeed is a package with our proposals worth $90bn,” the Ukrainian president said. “And we have agreements with the US president that when our export opens, they will buy Ukrainian drones. This is important for us.” In stark contrast to the heated exchange during Zelenskyy’s first trip to Trump’s White House in February, the Ukrainian president’s charm offensive this time around looked to pay off , allowing him to emerge unscathed. Zelenskyy – who wore a black military-style suit and presented a letter from his wife, Olena Zelenska, for Melania Trump in response to her letter to Putin – said this meeting with Trump was his “best” so far.

The current administration is reportedly in talks to have the US government acquire a stake in the chipmaker. Bloomberg first reported the news without specifics about the size or value of the potential share the government wants to buy. According to a newer report by Bloomberg and The New York Times , the Trump administration is looking to take a 10 percent stake in Intel as part of its efforts to give domestic chip manufacturing a boost. The administration is reportedly considering converting the $10.86 billion in federal grants Intel is getting from the US Chips and Science Act into equity instead. It's still early days, and the White House is still deciding on the exact size of the stake. Intel initially shared plans to construct a semiconductor facility in Ohio in 2022 while Pat Gelsinger was still at the helm of the company. Since then, the project has faced delays , and at its latest quarterly earnings report, execs said Intel would \" slow the pace \" on the Ohio construction, as well as scrapping other international building plans and making workforce cuts. The potential for government ownership of Intel is the latest swing of the administration's attitude toward the company. A few days after calling for his resignation over connections to China, President Donald Trump met with CEO Lip-Bu Tan and seemed to now hold a more positive outlook on the company leader. A representative from Intel told Bloomberg in a statement that the company is \"deeply committed to supporting President Trump’s efforts to strengthen US technology and manufacturing leadership. We look forward to continuing our work with the Trump administration to advance these shared priorities, but we are not going to comment on rumors or speculation.\" Update, August 18 2025, 10:31AM ET: This story has been updated to include new reports that the Trump administration is looking to take a 10 percent stake in Intel.

That means the expected official announcement of the iPhone 17 line. The latest iOS 26 features will come preinstalled on the new models, as well as any additional features Apple reveals at the launch event. But since we still have to wait a few weeks (presumably) until the iPhone event, we can at least speculate what the new phones will look like. As with most unreleased iPhone models, rumors and leaks have trickled in about the hardware side ahead of the official introduction. Here's what we're expecting and what we can reasonably assume we'll get from Cupertino in September. What are the latest iPhone 17 rumors? The latest rumor from a Weibo leaker known as Digital Chat Station suggests the iPhone 17e will come equipped with a new design that includes the Dynamic Island, MacRumors reports . According to the post, the new phone will have the A19 chip and could have a 6.1-inch OLED display with a front-facing 12-megapixel camera and a rear-facing 48-megapixel camera. In additional to the usual caveat — this is just a rumor and we won't know what the actual iPhone 17 models look like until Apple's iPhone event next month — there's a second important distinction here. This report refers to the 17e model that would be expected to launch no earlier than February 2026, if it followed the same release pattern as the iPhone 16e . How much will the iPhone 17 cost? Apple's announced plan to expand US-based manufacturing partners seems to give it at least some shielding from the steepest Trump administration tariffs that have already triggered price increases on everything from Switch consoles to high-end cameras to Sonos speakers . But given that President Trump's trade policies can change from week to week, and Apple's continuing reliance on Asia-based supply chains, price shocks remain an ongoing possibility. The bigger question is: Will Apple absorb any higher costs, or pass them on to consumers? If prices do creep up, Apple may choose to pair it with an \"upgrade.\" Consider this recent rumor posted by MacRumors from a leaker known as \" Instant Digital ,\" suggesting that the default storage of the iPhone 17 line may start at 256GB, doubling the current 128GB baseline. While that could be accompanied by a price increase of $50 , Apple could at least pitch it as a \"better value.\" That said, the company doubled the default RAM of its Mac computers from 8GB to 16GB at no extra cost in 2024 — but that was before the current Trump tariff cycle started. When will the iPhone 17 series be announced? Most years, the flagship smartphones are introduced in September. MacRumors highlighted a story originally reported by iphone-ticker.de that the Apple iPhone 17 event could be Tuesday, September 9, according to information gleaned from German mobile phone providers. It's still too early to have the specific dates; some years, Apple only gives a week or two of lead time between sending invites and hosting the event. But years of past precedent show that sometime in September should be when the 17 models make their debut. This family of smartphones may be the last to follow that trend, however. There have been hints that the introduction of the iPhone 18 collection in 2026 will be split into a pro-tier announcement in the fall and a standard model announcement the following spring. What will the new iPhone 17 lineup include? Design leaks suggest that Apple is building an ultra-thin smartphone , likely to be named the iPhone 17 Air to match Apple's ultralight laptop designation. Bloomberg 's Mark Gurman, often a solid source of advanced intel about Apple, reported in January that the iPhone 17 Air will be equipped with a basic A19 chip and will only have a single camera lens. It may also use Apple's new in-house modem, which was introduced in February on the iPhone 16e . More details about this development may leak ahead of September, but that's what we know for now. An investor note from Apple analyst Jeff Pu indicated that the Air will have a titanium frame. If his reports are accurate, the lightweight smartphone will be the only entry in the iPhone 17 lineup to use that metal; the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max are expected to be made of aluminum, which is oddly a lighter material than titanium. Other speculation had suggested that the Air would use a blend of aluminum and titanium, so the exact materials may not be known until the official announcement. Additionally, an August 4 MacRumors report says the internal battery pack of the iPhone Air is just 2.49mm thick — half the thickness of the iPhone 17 Pro battery. The leak was posted on the Korean-language Naver blog , where they show the alleged batteries of the iPhone 17 Air and 17 Pro side by side. The same account claimed the 17 Air's battery capacity was a mere 2,800 mAh, MacRumors notes. (That's below the battery capacity of current iPhone 16 models.) On a similar topic, an iPhone 17 Pro production leak appears to have revealed an all-aluminum chassis, according to MacRumors . Originally posted by leaker Majin Bu , the image shows a shell that has a large round hole on the back (where the Apple logo typically is) to allow for MagSafe charging. MacRumors says this could just be a molding but notes that the aluminum frame (versus the current titanium in Pro iPhone models) would yield a significantly lower weight. That same leaker (Majin Bu), whom MacRumors classifies as a \"hit-or-miss leaker,\" suggests the iPhone 17 Pro will have better wireless signal strength thanks to an updated antenna design. The individual posted a render on X that shows a new antenna system that wraps around the iPhone 17 Pro's supposedly wider rear camera bump. Again, this is a render, not a real-world photo. That said, we can't knock the goal of better wireless reception, so we're hoping this one has a degree of truth to it. Each new roster includes a base model, but over the years, Apple has shaken up the variety of phones it offers. Most likely there will be an iPhone 17 and an iPhone 17 Pro. Apple has also committed to the size matters philosophy, and has been building an iPhone Pro Max option with an even bigger screen and better battery life; the 17 roster will almost certainly have one as well. The new Pro iPhones are said to have a full-width \"camera island\" on the rear, which would mark the first time an Apple model opted for that design. This feature can be seen in the purported iPhone 17 \"spotted in the wild.\" The pics, highlighted on MacRumors , show a black cased iPhone (17 Pro?) with the distinct back panel. Is it the real deal? The dual angles lend a degree of credibility in a social media landscape increasingly polluted with AI-enhanced fakes, but your guess is as good as ours. I just spotted a test development iPhone in the wild 🤩🤩🤩 pic.twitter.com/iS3PtKWqxJ — Fox Pupy 🦊🧡 (@Skyfops) July 28, 2025 The iPhone 17 Air seems primed to take the place of a potential iPhone 17 Plus. Since the iPhone 16e was only just introduced in February at a surprisingly high price point , it seems unlikely that there will be a new addition to that lower end of the spectrum, the models that were previously called SE. At the very least, it sounds like the iPhone 17 Air won't take away the charging port and rely only on wireless connectivity. Bloomberg said that while Apple had investigated making the iPhone 17 Air without a single port, the company (fortunately) changed plans. He also says that the rumored phone will have a 6.6-inch screen and include the Dynamic Island and Camera Control button. Finally, the price is rumored at $900 — likely more than the standard iPhone 17 but less than the Pro. We've also gotten what seems to be a reliable look at what the color lineup will be for the new smartphones. Macworld reported that the iPhone 17 will be available in black, white, steel gray, green, purple and light blue. The iPhone 17 Air will reportedly have four color options: black, white, light blue and light gold. While the Air colors will be less saturated, the visuals for the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max will go bold. The options for the Pro models are expected to be black, white, gray, dark blue and orange. On July 30, Tom's Guide highlighted an X post from Sonny Dickson — a longtime and generally reliable leaker of unreleased iPhone information — showing \"dummy\" iPhone 17 models in the new colors that were the source of the aforementioned Macworld story. While these are literally just mock-ups — not real, leaked iPhones — it's interesting to see how the design and color rumors translate into a real-world look and feel. What will iOS 26 be like? Apple upended its numbering conventions with WWDC 2025, and will match the name of each new operating system to the year it's released. So when the next wave of iPhones hits, they'll be running on iOS 26 . On the design side, the smartphone OS introduced during the big developer showcase took a contentious approach dubbed Liquid Glass. Apple has been scaling down the amount of transparency effects in the subsequent beta tests of iOS 26, but it will still have a glass-like visual. The feature list includes big and small updates. On the more impactful side, the Phone and Photos apps have been redesigned. There will be several features leveraging artificial intelligence, such as live translation capabilities coming to Phone, FaceTime and Messages. Apple is also currently testing a sensitive content warning for child accounts that will freeze FaceTime video if nudity is detected by on-device machine learning tools. And the company is also launching Visual Intelligence, which will use AI to search for elements in an image. iOS 26 also has a litany of minor, quality of life improvements. Group texts are getting support for polls. And for the slow risers out there, iOS 26 will finally let you escape the tyranny of the nine minute snooze alarm . The next iOS is now available as a public beta . Here are our initial impressions of the Liquid Glass design and other new features. iOS 26 is compatible with all models back through iPhone 11. What other products are expected to be released alongside the iPhone 17? If Apple follows its usual pattern, the iPhone 17 will be announced alongside new Apple Watch products. That would be the Apple Watch Series 11 (if Apple sticks to the same naming scheme), and maybe an Apple Watch Ultra 3 and/or an updated Apple Watch SE. (They'll all run watchOS 26 , of course.) Other possibilities — and this is, again, speculation — could include refreshed Apple AirPods Pro (which received its last big update in 2022 ) and maybe new AirTags trackers (first released in 2021). The Apple rumor mill got a big shot in the arm this week thanks to the reported inclusion of product ID numbers in recent beta software builds. Per MacRumors , it's a laundry list of new hardware, including long-rumored product updates like the Apple TV , HomePod mini , new Apple Studio Display monitor and two fresh iPads. Of course, even if that list is totally accurate, we may not see those products until 2026 — if ever. So don't expect all of products to share the stage with the iPhone 17, especially since Apple likes to keep its star performer at the center of attention. That said, keep in mind that Apple has recently been having Mac-centric announcements in late October (as it did last year to debut new M4 Macs ), so there's always the chance of another shoe dropping a few weeks down the road.

Paxton says that AI chatbots from either platform \"can present themselves as professional therapeutic tools,\" to the point of lying about their qualifications. That behavior that can leave younger users vulnerable to misleading and inaccurate information. Because AI platforms often rely on user prompts as another source of training data, either company could also be violating young user's privacy and misusing their data. This is of particular interest in Texas, where the SCOPE Act places specific limits on what companies can do with data harvested from minors, and requires platform's offer tools so parents can manage the privacy settings of their children's accounts. For now, the Attorney General has submitted Civil Investigative Demands (CIDs) to both Meta and Character.AI to see if either company is violating Texas consumer protection laws. As TechCrunch notes , neither Meta nor Character.AI claim their AI chatbot platforms should be used as mental health tools. That doesn't prevent there from being multiple \"Therapist\" and \"Psychologist\" chatbots on Character.AI. Nor does it stop either of the companies' chatbots from claiming they're licensed professionals, as 404 Media reported in April. \"The user-created Characters on our site are fictional, they are intended for entertainment, and we have taken robust steps to make that clear,\" a Character.AI spokesperson said when asked to comment on the Texas investigation. \"For example, we have prominent disclaimers in every chat to remind users that a Character is not a real person and that everything a Character says should be treated as fiction.\" Meta shared a similar sentiment in its comment. \"We clearly label AIs, and to help people better understand their limitations, we include a disclaimer that responses are generated by AI — not people,\" the company said. Meta AIs are also supposed to \"direct users to seek qualified medical or safety professionals when appropriate.\" Sending people to real resources is good, but ultimately disclaimers themselves are easy to ignore, and don't act as much of an obstacle. With regards to privacy and data usage, both Meta's privacy policy and the Character.AI's privacy policy acknowledge that data is collected from users' interactions with AI. Meta collects things like prompts and feedback to improve AI performance. Character.AI logs things like identifiers and demographic information and says that information can be used for advertising, among other applications. How either policy applies to children, and fits with Texas' SCOPE Act, seems like it'll depend on how easy it is to make an account.

While you'll need to be on the $20-a-month GeForce Now Ultimate tier to use RTX 5080 streaming servers, NVIDIA at least isn't raising that tier's price. Subscribers at that level will still receive 100 hours of monthly playtime (with 15 hours of rollover), up to eight-hour long sessions and access to all of GPU's respective DLSS features, including Frame Generation. NVIDIA claims the RTX 5080 GeForce Now servers will perform up to 2.8 times faster than the current RTX 4080 systems — but of course, that's due to the new GPU's 4X Frame Gen capabilities, which interpolates frames using AI modeling. The 4080 only supports up to 2X Frame Generation. At launch, GeForce Now's RTX 5080 servers will support popular games like Doom: The Dark Ages, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle , Cyberpunk 2077 and Flight Simulator . We're still waiting for a full list of supported titles from NVIDIA, as well updates on when we can expect more games that will support the RTX 5080. While the raw power of the RTX 5080 will be the main draw for the GeForce NOW Ultimate tier, NVIDIA is also improving something that's always bothered me with game streaming: image quality. No matter the resolution and framerate I've seen while streaming games across multiple services, I've always noticed that the color fidelity and overall sharpness doesn't look as good as rendering a game locally on a PC. NVIDIA's new Cinematic Quality Streaming (CQS) aims to change that, with support for YUV 4:4:4 chroma subsampling (for more accurate colors), smoother video streaming performance with the AV1 codec, and AI video filtering to reduce artifacts. CQS will also be able to automatically detect and optimize its settings for the DPI of your screen — that's helpful for high DPI laptop screens. With CQS turned on, GeForce Now streams will max out at a hefty 100Mbps. That'll make it ideal for people with 1Gbps or faster connections, but it could be out of reach if you've got slower internet or restrictive bandwidth caps. I've only seen a screenshot of CQS in action, but it's definitely something I'll be testing further once the new GeForce NOW servers launch in September. NVIDIA also plans to expand the number of titles on GeForce NOW with a new feature called Install-to-Play games, which will automatically get installed to cloud storage servers. Performance and Ultimate-tier subscribers will get 100GB of storage for free, and they can upgrade to 200GB for $2.99 monthly, 500GB for $4.99 per month and 1TB for $7.99. Typically, GeForce NOW games are preinstalled on servers and wait for players to queue them up. (It's also worth noting that the service taps into games you've already bought on existing storefronts like Steam, your subscription doesn't get you a collection of games to play like Xbox cloud streaming.) NVIDIA says that GeForce Now will have up 2,300 pre-installed games this year, and together with Install-to-Play options there will be over 4,500 games on the service. That goes a long way towards making GeForce Now more appealing to mainstream players — if you could play most new titles over the cloud for a monthly fee, why have a gaming PC at all? To that end, NVIDIA is also making GeForce NOW work even better across a wide variety of devices. It'll support up to 90fps on the Steam Deck through its native app, and it will also stream in 5K on newer LG OLED monitors. LG TVs will also get a native GeForce NOW app that supports up to 4K 120Hz streams, a first for any TV maker. NVIDIA also says that many Logitech racing wheels will be supported, as well. (Though I wonder how many people are traveling with wheels when they want to game on the go.) While its unclear if game streaming will ever replace local gaming, GeForce NOW is certainly getting close with the addition of RTX 5080 GPUs and a wealth of new features. And given the rise of streaming TV service costs these days, its pricing seems relatively fair. You can test out a free ad-supported version of GeForce NOW, or pay $10 a month (or $100 a year) for ad-free 1,440p support. For most people, especially if they're just streaming to laptops and handhelds, that'll be more than enough. But the Ultimate tier isn't unreasonable at $20 a month, $100 for six months or $200 annually. That's a small price to pay to game in 4K (and 5K!) without a huge rig. During my recent testing of GeForce NOW Ultimate with RTX 4080 servers, I noticed that it's relatively easy to launch games, performance is generally smooth and it works well across handhelds, TVs and multiple computers. I'd expect much of the same for the RTX 5080 servers, but I'll report back next month when they actually launch.

In a blog post announcing the breach, the company said that a social engineering campaign had targeted its employees, with threat actors posing as IT or HR in order to trick employees into sharing account access or personal information. The company says that while the threat actors were able to access some information from the CRM, there is no indication of any access to customer accounts or the data within them. \"We acted quickly to cut the access and have added extra safeguards to protect against similar incidents in the future,\" the post reads. Workday says that the information gathered from the CRM consists of \"commonly available\" business contact information such as names, email addresses and phone numbers. From the sound of its blog post, the information of Workday end users was not revealed, only information from the companies it has contracts with. What is known with some certainty at this point is that Workday's CRM was breached. The company's statement that \"no indication\" of a deeper customer data breach was found is far from a guarantee — often, the full scope of hacks like this aren’t known until later. Earlier this year, Workday laid off around 1,750 employees, or around 8.5 percent of its workforce. The company said it was \"prioritizing innovation investments like AI and platform development, and rigorously evaluating the ROI of others across the board.\" The precise third-party CRM Workday is referring to was not disclosed. Earlier this year Google fell victim to a hack via the Salesforce app, and last year Disney said it would stop using Slack, the Salesforce-owned messaging platform, after a hack exposed company data.

(Apple) We're past the the halfway point of August, which means that we're very likely less than a month away from Apple's annual iPhone event. In addition to announcing its newest iPhone 17 lineup , the company will also give us an official date for downloading iOS 26 . While we wait to find out, you can download and install the newly released public beta 2 (or iOS 26 developer beta 6 for developers). I've been playing around with it for the past couple of weeks, and have found that taking screenshots is way better in the new operating system — Google and ChatGPT search options are now in the screenshots editor, for instance. You can see a more complete view of the new features in our preview of the iOS 26 public beta release , which shows off the fresh home and lock screen redesign. Called Liquid Glass , the new translucent look will extend across all of Apple's upcoming operating systems. The overhaul is one of several big changes coming to iOS, macOS , iPadOS and the rest of Apple's software suite, all of which were showcased during the company's WWDC keynote on June 9. After overpromising on AI plans last year, Apple kept its iOS roadmap focused more on basic quality of life improvements this year. There are multiple useful additions coming to the Phone and Messages apps on your iPhone, for instance: Apple execs outlined the ability to weed out spam texts or other unknown senders and an option to hold your spot on a phone call when you've been waiting for a representative to pick up. Plus, a treasured feature that we took for granted is coming back (hint: it's in the Photos app). Siri, meanwhile, is in a holding pattern. Apple has previously specified that its smarter voice assistant — first promised at WWDC 2024 — is delayed until some point \" in the coming year ,\" so you shouldn't expect any major changes in the current betas. But there are reports that Apple is aiming to give Siri a bigger brain transplant by basing it on third-party artificial intelligence models like OpenAI's ChatGPT or Anthropic's Claude, which could make 2026 a pivotal year. The company is also reportedly working on a 'stripped-down' AI chatbot to rival ChatGPT. With each beta, it seems like additional new improvements are popping up, like this new AirPods gesture we're all curious about, and this FaceTime feature that'll freeze your video if it detects nudity . With the release of the iOS 26 developer beta 5 , we saw more added features, like a new bouncy animation on the passcode screen and in the Control Center, MacRumors reports . Some or all of those changes will likely soon migrate into the separate public beta (see below). Most newer iPhone models are eligible to download iOS 26 (both the betas and final version). Want to see the full list of new features coming this fall? Read on. What is iOS 26? The current iPhone operating system is iOS 18, and Apple is still actively updating it — version 18.6.1 was just recently released to restore Apple Watch blood oxygen monitoring functionality for certain users in the US, and another minor iOS 18 update is expected before the newest OS is launched, according to a leaker who shared the info with MacRumors . But don't expect to see iOS 19. Instead, Apple is skipping the numbering ahead to iOS 26 later this year. The company has decided to line up its iOS version numbers with a year-based system, similar to car model years. So while iOS and its sibling operating systems will be released in late 2025, they're all designated \"26\" to reflect the year ahead. It's official, we're moving to iOS 26. (Apple) What is Liquid Glass design? Let's be honest. Out of everything announced at WWDC this year, the new Liquid Glass design was the star of the show. The iPhone's home and lock screens have looked pretty much the same year after year — the last exciting thing (in my opinion) was the option to add your own aesthetic to your home screen by customizing your apps and widgets. So seeing the home and lock screens' new facelift is refreshing. So what exactly is Liquid Glass? Apple calls it a \" new translucent material \" since, well, the apps and widgets are clear. However, the screen can still adapt to dark and light modes, depending on surroundings. You'll also notice buttons with a new floating design in several apps, like Phone and Maps. They're designed to be less distracting than the current buttons, but are still easy to see. While the design overhaul has proven to be controversial since its announcement, some — including Engadget's own Devindra Hardawar — like the new direction, even if it's somewhat reminiscent of Microsoft's translucent Windows Vista Aero designs from nearly twenty years ago. That said, as of the release of the iOS 26 beta 2, Apple has already incorporated some user feedback into the design, dialing back the transparency in at least some places. And while it will continue to evolve, Apple users won't be able to escape it: Liquid Glass was designed to make all of Apple's OSes more cohesive. Here's a look at how the translucent aesthetic will look with the new macOS Tahoe 26 on your desktop. What are the new and notable features of iOS 26? iOS 26 has a laundry list of new features. Among the most worthwhile: Phone app redesign: You'll finally be able to scroll through contacts, recent calls and voicemail messages all on one screen. It also comes with a new feature called Hold Assist that'll notify you when an agent comes to the phone so you can avoid the elevator music and continue on with other tasks. Live Translation in Phone, FaceTime and Messages: iOS 26 is bringing the ability to have a conversation via phone call or text message with someone who speaks another language. Live Translation will translate your conversation in real time, which results in some stop-and-go interactions in the examples Apple shared during its presentation. Polls in group chats: Tired of sorting through what seems like hundreds of messages in your group chat? You and your friends will soon be able to create polls in group messages for deciding things like which brunch spot you're eating at or whose car you're taking on a road trip. Filtering unknown senders in Messages: If you haven't received spam texts about unpaid tolls or other citations, you're lucky. For those of us who have, those annoying messages will soon be filtered away in a separate folder. Visual Intelligence: Similar to a reverse Google image search, this new feature will allow you to search for anything that's on your iPhone screen. For instance, if you spot a pair of shoes someone is wearing in an Instagram photo, you can screenshot it and use Visual Intelligence to find those shoes (or similar ones) online. Photos tabs are back: For anyone who's still frustrated with the Photos changes made last year , you'll be happy to know that your tabs are coming back. Library and Collections will have their own separate spaces so you don't have to scroll to infinity to find what you're looking for. FaceTime \"Communication Safety\" feature: A newer addition to iOS 26 appears to be the FaceTime \"Communication Safety\" feature that pauses communications if and when nudity is detected. The feature appears to be a child safety feature that uses on-device detection, thus obviating any cloud-based privacy issues. New lock screen options : The iPhone lock screen gets more customizable in iOS 26, with a cooler clock, 3D wallpaper effects, more widgets and better focus mode options. Apple's Hold Assist will be nifty for those pesky services that put you on hold for 10 or more minutes. (Apple) New changes coming to iPadOS 26 Your iPad isn't getting left behind when it comes to big updates. Here's what's coming this fall. Multitasking and real windowing: When you download the newest update, you'll be able to have multiple apps running on your screen at the same time. Once you open an app, it'll appear on your screen as normal but you'll be able to resize and move it across your screen to make room for other apps. This feature is optional so you can turn it off if you don't like it. Visual update: Along with the other new OSes, iPadOS 26 is coming with the Liquid Glass aesthetic. This new look will appear on the lock and home screens, as well as the drop-down menus. New menu bar: When you swipe down on your screen, the new menu bar will appear with options like File, Edit, Windows and more. There's also a search option if you're looking for something specific. Check out our first impressions of iPadOS 26 . What about AirPods? AirPods are also getting updated with iOS 26. Here are some of the more notable functions. Enhanced audio recording: Apple calls this \"studio-quality\" audio recording, and with it, you'll notice more clarity while in noisy environments. Camera remote control: Using this, you can take a photo or start and stop video recording with just one press on your AirPods. When taking photos, you'll get a three-second countdown before your iPhone or iPad snaps the picture. Live translation feature: While not officially announced or confirmed, it appears that the long-rumored live translation for AirPods could be coming with iOS 26 . The evidence comes from a system asset spotted in the in iOS 26 beta showing a gesture that's triggered by pressing both earbud stems at the same time. The photo also shows words in several different languages. Which iPhones will be able to upgrade to iOS 26? A few iPhone models that run the current version of iOS — iPhone XR, XS and XS Max — won't be compatible with the latest upgrade. But any iPhones released in 2019 or later will be eligible for the iOS 26 update . iPhone SE (second generation or later) iPhone 11 iPhone 11 Pro iPhone 11 Pro Max iPhone 12 iPhone 12 mini iPhone 12 Pro iPhone 12 Pro Max iPhone 13 iPhone 13 mini iPhone 13 Pro iPhone 13 Pro Max iPhone 14 iPhone 14 Plus iPhone 14 Pro iPhone 14 Pro Max iPhone 15 iPhone 15 Plus iPhone 15 Pro iPhone 15 Pro Max iPhone 16 iPhone 16 Plus iPhone 16 Pro iPhone 16 Pro Max iPhone 16e Not listed here are the presumed new iPhone 17 models (or maybe iPhone 26?) that are all but certain to be announced and released in September. How to install iOS 26 beta The iOS 26 public beta is now available to download via the Apple Beta Software Program . If you're not already a member, you'll need to sign up to try out all the latest features. Just visit beta.apple.com and sign up with your phone number or email address. It's free. Once you're in, you can install it by going to Settings > General > Software Update and selecting iOS 26 public beta . A word of caution: Don't sign up with your main iPhone unless you're OK with any risks that occur with using an OS that isn't finalized. When will the final version of iOS 26 be released? iOS 26 will be released to the public this fall. It usually comes in September, within a week of the Apple iPhone event. Last year, it rolled out to iPhone users on September 16 — exactly one week after the iPhone 16 lineup was announced.

All aspects of Meshnet will stop working on that date, though nothing else about NordVPN will be affected. If you were using Meshnet to connect computers, route web traffic through a personal device or share files, you'll need to find another solution by December. As I mentioned in my NordVPN review , Meshnet was one of the most envelope-pushing features on any VPN, letting users link their devices through a NordLynx tunnel without needing to go through a third-party server. Once the tunnel was set up, you could access either device through the other one to share files or access services. With enough connected devices, you could check your work email, visit a friend's media server, play a remote game on another server and watch your home-based TV subscriptions — all from a single laptop anywhere on the planet. Unbelievably, it was even free to use. I'm sad to see Meshnet go, but as NordVPN's blog post makes clear, it never found its audience. As exciting as it was to people like me who spend all day squinting at the guts of VPNs, it didn't provide enough everyday value to catch on with the majority of NordVPN's customers. Hindsight shows us that Meshnet's benefits, like remote desktop and file sharing, were mainly business-oriented; selling those was always going to be an uphill battle in a market where VPNs are more commonly used for personal reasons . If you're one of the few people who was actually using Meshnet, you have a few months to arrange alternatives. Should you want to stay within the NordVPN ecosystem, you can replace its file sharing features with NordLocker , which gives you 3 GB of storage for free. Of course, Google Drive is also an option. For remote access, NordVPN recommends ZeroTier , a platform where you can connect up to 10 devices without paying.

Prior to this, it wasn't always possible to upgrade to a paid subscription directly in the app. Substack However, there's a fairly major caveat. It's likely that subscriptions paid for by in-app purchases will be more expensive than usual. That's to accommodate Apple's cut of the revenue.

Google's new hardware has leaked far and wide. But that doesn't mean there couldn't be a few surprises. If you want to be the first to hear the official scoop, you can tune into the Made by Google YouTube channel (or right here!). The event kicks off at 1PM ET on August 20. Sam Rutherford for Engadget What's on tap? You can expect a more power-efficient Tensor G5 processor in all the new Pixel 10 phones. (That could help power new Gemini AI features , too.) The base-level Pixel 10 should get a big camera upgrade: a 5x telephoto lens. Before this generation, you had to splurge on a Pro or Fold model to get optical zoom. Cameras will be higher-res across the board, too. In other areas, Qi2 magnetic charging is expected to come to the new Pixels. Expect a new accessory ecosystem, a la Apple's MagSafe , dubbed \"Pixelsnap.\" We'll also likely see the Pixel Watch 4 with a larger battery and smaller bezels . And the Pixel Buds 2a could bring refinements to the company's budget earbuds . Finally, Google teased... a strange number of guests for the upcoming event. Apparently, Jimmy Fallon, Stephen Curry, Lando Norris and the Jonas Brothers are all joining the stream. So get excited for some awkward celebrity endorsements!

The next Made by Google event is on the books for August 20 , and Google has already confirmed what at least one of its new Pixel 10 phones will look like. Google seems dead-set on making a big splash at this event, too. On the Friday before Made by Google, the company dropped a video on X noting that a number of \"special guests\" were participating, including Jimmy Fallon, Stephen Curry, Lando Norris and the Jonas Brothers. What they all will have to do with a phone launch remains to be seen. Google remains as leak-prone as ever, so nearly all the new hardware the company is expected to announce has all ready been reported on in one form or another.

Pixel 10, 10 Pro, 10 Pro XL and 10 Pro Fold Android Headlines / Onleaks Google's invitation for the event says that the company is sharing \"the latest on our Pixel phones, watches, buds and more,” which more or less confirms the company will introduce a slate of products that's similar to what it launched in 2024. That means a Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, Pixel 10 Pro XL and Pixel 10 Pro Fold are absolutely on the menu. Google's tease of the Pixel 10 confirmed what leaked renders have already signaled: the company isn't abandoning the new design language the Pixel 9 established. The pill-shaped camera bump and flat front display will still be present on the Pixel 10, and the real changes will be in the details, like for example, how the flat sides of the Pixel 10 join with the phone's back. Those subtle changes will apparently also include the thickness of the Pixel 10s. While both the Pixel 10, 10 Pro, 10 Pro XL and 10 Pro Fold will use the same sized OLED screens as their Pixel 9 counterparts, they'll be housed in thicker and heavier bodies, according to Android Headlines . Google's new Pixels are also supposed to come in new colors . The Pixel 10 will come in \"Frost\" (a royal blue), \"Lemongrass\" (a yellow), \"Indigo\" (a light purple) and \"Obsidian\" (a dark gray), while the Pixel 10 Pro / Pro XL will come in Obsidian, \"Porcelain\" (off-white), \"Moonstone\" (a bluish gray) and \"Jade\" (a light green). Less information is known about the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, though recent leaks suggest it'll come in Moonstone and Jade, as well. Android Headlines The most visible external change that'll be introduced on the Pixel 10 is the addition of a new telephoto camera. The new telephoto camera is a 11-megapixel 5x telephoto, Android Authority reports , similar to the one on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. Meanwhile, the Pixel 10 Pro and 10 Pro XL are expected to feature a 50-megapixel wide, 48-megapixel ultrawide, 48-megapixel telephoto and 48-megapixel selfie cameras. The Pixel 10 Pro Fold could feature a different lineup, with a similar main camera, but 12-megapixel ultrawide and telephoto cameras, and 11-megapixel selfie cameras. Inside the new phones, Google is laying the groundwork for future performance gains with a new Tensor G5 chip. It's likely be much more power-efficient thanks to the company switching to a 3nm design produced by TSMC. Reports suggest the chip might not be all that different in terms of raw power, but the Tensor G5 is likely designed to be extra capable when it comes to using local AI features. As far as timing goes, it's worth noting that the latest rumors indicate that the Pixel 10, 10 Pro and 10 Pro XL will be available about a week after the event, on August 28. But the Pixel 10 Pro Fold (as well as the Pixel Watch 4 and Pixel Buds 2a aren't expected for more than a month after that. Those devices are rumored to be on sale as of October 9. While global tariff turmoil could justify a price increase, Google is reportedly keeping things consistent with the Pixel 10 family. They'll offer similar storage options, come in at the same prices and include the same freebies and incentives. The Pixel 10 will come with six months of Google AI Pro and Fitbit Premium, along with three months of YouTube Premium. Meanwhile the Pixel 10 Pro models will get a year of Google AI Pro, six months of Fitbit Premium and three months of YouTube Premium. The prices and storage options for the phones should breakout down as follows: Pixel 10: 128GB ($799), 256GB ($899) Pixel 10 Pro: 128GB ($999), 256GB ($1,099), 512GB ($1,219), 1TB ($1,449) Pixel 10 Pro XL: 256GB ($1,199), 512GB ($1,319), 1TB ($1,549) Pixel 10 Pro Fold: 256GB ($1,799), 512GB ($1,919), 1TB ($2,149) Pixel Watch 4 91mobiles / Onleaks The third time was the charm for the Pixel Watch 3 , so the main task Google has with the Pixel Watch 4 is to not squander the solid base it already has. Leaks for the company's new smartwatches have been limited so far, but renders of the Pixel Watch 4 shared by 91mobiles do suggest Google has a few changes planned. Namely, much like the company's phones, the new Pixel Watch seems like it'll be a little bit thicker and come with smaller bezels. The Pixel Watch 4 should be available to purchase in the same 41mm and 45mm sizes as before, but in new colors — including a Moonstone option to match the Pixel 10 — and with a brighter display . The thicker frame will also help the smartwatch fit a larger battery and a new wireless charging system, according to Android Headlines . Rather than charge through a puck with pogo pins like the Pixel Watch 3, the Pixel Watch 4 will use a wireless charging stand that could fill it up even faster. Beyond that, Google has already indicated how Wear OS is evolving. The new Wear OS 6 update is debuting on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 , and will presumably be available on the Pixel Watch 4 at launch. It includes built-in access to Gemini, among other tweaks. Given Google also manages the Fitbit Premium subscription, it wouldn't be all that surprising if the Pixel Watch 4 gets some exclusive fitness tracking features, too. Pixel Buds 2a Billy Steele for Engadget Google launched the Pixel Buds Pro 2 last year, and it typically doesn't update its premium earbuds on a yearly cadence. So instead, Tom's Guide reports Google might pair the Pixel 10 with the Pixel Buds Pro 2 in a new color, and save its new hardware announcements for a sequel to the Pixel Buds A-series called the Pixel Buds 2a. Unlike the company's premium wireless earbuds, the A-series Pixel Buds have historically skimped on things like active noise cancellation to hit a lower price. There's little reporting on where Google will take the Pixel Buds 2a, but you can expect the new earbuds to come in some of the new colors being introduced on the Pixel 10. Pixelsnap The Qi2 wireless charging standard is available for all phone makers to use, but it hasn't been widely adopted among Android phone makers. Qi2 uses magnets to offer improved charging speeds, just like Apple's MagSafe, and the Pixel 10 could mark Google's adoption of Qi2 through a new feature called \"Pixelsnap.\" A report from Android Authority suggests the Pixel 10 will include the necessary magnets to make Qi2 happen, and will be introduced alongside a lineup of Pixelsnap accessories. New leaked images showing a Pixel 10 charging with a magnetic charging puck that looks a lot like Apple's MagSafe charger adds even more credence to the rumor. If you need even more convincing, the Wireless Power Consortium has announced that its faster Qi2 25W charging is coming to \"major Android phones.\" It would make sense if Google's Pixel 10s were included considering runs Android itself. Gemini and other exclusive software features Gemini is Google's current favorite, and the company is pushing the AI assistant everywhere it makes sense. The last few Pixel Drops — Google's regular Pixel-focused software updates — have primarily included Gemini features. It would make sense for Google to include a few more software exclusives on the Pixel 10. Google is hosting the Pixel 10 launch event on August 20 at 1PM ET / 10AM ET.

Oak Ridge, Tennessee, will be home to the Hermes 2 plant, which will supply Google with 50 megawatts of power under a long-term purchase agreement with the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA). The Oak Ridge plant is the first in a 500-megawatt deal that comprises multiple small modular reactors (SMRs) to provide power for Google's data centers in Montgomery County, Tennessee, and Jackson County, Alabama. The Hermes 2 is scheduled to begin operations in 2030. In a statement , TVA CEO Don Moul said, \"Nuclear is the bedrock of the future of energy security. Google stepping in and helping shoulder the burden of the cost and risk for first-of-a-kind nuclear projects not only helps Google get to those solutions, but it keeps us from having to burden our customers with development of that technology.\" Google's deal with Kairos Power is expected to reach its full 500 MW potential by 2035 and was the first-ever corporate deal to buy nuclear power from SMRs. The financial specifics of the deal have not been released.

Unfortunately, that demand can make finding big discounts on Apple gadgets a bit harder than usual. To make things easier, we're keeping a running list of the best Apple deals you can shop right now on AirPods, MacBooks, iPads and more. Just note that you’ll almost always find the best Apple deals from third-party retailers like Amazon , Best Buy , Walmart , Target and the like, not from Apple's own online store. Unless you shop refurbished , you’ll usually pay top dollar buying direct (though for some items like iPhones, that might be the best route to take). Best Mac deals Apple MacBook Air (15-inch, M4) for $999 ($200 off) : The 15-inch MacBook Air is nearly identical to the smaller version but features more robust speakers and a more spacious trackpad alongside its roomier display. $999 is the lowest price we've tracked. Apple MacBook Air (15-inch, M3, 24GB RAM) for $1,199 ($500 off) : The last-gen M3 MacBook Air has officially been discontinued, but it remains a superb laptop while stock remains available. We gave this 15-inch model a score of 90 in our review — outside of its slower chip (which is still plenty fast for everyday use), marginally improved camera and inability to power two external displays with the lid open, it's virtually identical to the newer version. This deal applies to the model with 24GB of memory. The 13-inch version , meanwhile, is down to $999 at Best Buy. Apple MacBook Pro (14-inch, M4 Pro) for $1,699 ($300 off) : The MacBook Pro goes beyond most people’s needs, but it remains a powerhouse for coders, media editors or anyone else with especially demanding workloads. We gave it a score of 92 last November. Just keep in mind that it’s heavier than the MacBook Air and that it still lacks a standard USB-A port. Also at Best Buy . Apple Mac mini (M4) for $499 ($100 off) : The newest version of Apple’s tiny desktop PC has a smaller overall footprint, a faster M4 chip, 16GB of RAM as standard (finally), two front-facing USB-C ports (finally!), an extra Thunderbolt 4 port and the ability to drive three external displays. It lacks USB-A ports, however. We gave the M4 Pro model a review score of 90 . This deal is for the entry-level version with a base M4 chip, 16GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD — we’ve seen it fall as low as $469 in the past, but this is still a decent savings compared to buying direct from Apple. Also at Best Buy . Best AirPods deals Apple AirPods Pro 2 for $169 ($80 off) : The AirPods Pro 2 are Apple’s best set of wireless earbuds for now, as they offer the full set of Apple-focused features, strong ANC, onboard volume controls, a comfy in-ear design and a warm sound profile that most should find agreeable. They can even work as a hearing aid , though their six-hour battery life still isn’t the best, and you should only get them if you’re all-in on Apple hardware. But if that’s the case, we consider them the best wireless earbuds for iPhone owners. This deal is $20 off the all-time low we saw last month, but it's still a ways below the set's usual going rate. Also at Walmart and Best Buy . Exercise caution, though: If you're not in a rush, this is another Apple device that may see a refresh within the next couple of months. Best iPad deals Apple iPad Pro 11-inch (M4) for $896 ($104 off) : The iPad Pro is much more tablet than most people need, but it’s the ultimate iPad for those who can stomach its price tag. It’s wonderfully thin, its OLED display is one of the best we’ve seen on a consumer device and its M4 chip can handle virtually anything you’d ever do on an iPad. It’s also the only Apple tablet with Face ID, plus it has a better speaker setup than the iPad Air. We gave it a score of 84 in our review, with the only real drawback being its price. Also at BJ's for $50 less, if you have a membership there. Best Apple Watch deals Apple Watch Ultra 2 for $650 ($149 off) : Apple’s most premium smartwatch, the Ultra 2 has a killer 36-hour battery life, a handy Low Power mode for extended use and cellular connectivity by default. It also has a compass app, water temperature gauge and a loud onboard siren that you can trigger in emergencies. This discount marks the lowest price we've tracked. But again, we wouldn't be surprised if Apple introduced an updated model in the coming weeks. Apple Watch SE (GPS, 40mm) for $169 ($80 off) : As with the more premium models, we wouldn’t be surprised to see an update to Apple’s budget smartwatch sometime soon (and we have a few suggestions on the matter). But thanks to some serious discounts, the Apple Watch SE has turned out to be the most affordable way to get an iPhone companion for your wrist. Despite a lackluster screen and limited extra features, it handles the basics well. Also at Target . Best Apple accessories deals Apple Pencil (USB-C) for $69 ($10 off) : This more affordable Apple Pencil doesn’t support pressure sensitivity, but it still makes for a useful stylus for the basics. If you’re a casual note-taker and can live without wireless charging, you’ll save a few bucks by picking this one up. Also at Walmart .

One of those is Kirby Air Riders , a sequel to the 2003 GameCube title Kirby Air Ride . The company is set to reveal much (much) more about what it has in store for the new game, as it has lined up a dedicated Nintendo Direct. You'll be able to watch the showcase, which was first announced via the Nintendo Today! app , at 9AM ET on August 19. You won't have to go hunting for it on Nintendo's channel either, as you can click the big red button on the YouTube video above. The stream will run for about 45 minutes and \"provide an in-depth look at the upcoming Nintendo Switch 2 game,\" according to the company. On the surface, that seems like a very long showcase for a single game by Nintendo standards, considering that it's able to rip through a couple of dozen game reveals (or more) in a regular Direct that's as long or shorter. The recent Direct for Donkey Kong Bananza clocked in at just under 18 minutes and had a ton of info about that game. However, if you've ever seen a character reveal for game director Masahiro Sakurai's previous project, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate , you'll be aware that the man tends to get into the nitty gritty. After all, the deep dive into the final SSBU fighter, Sora from Kingdom Hearts, is 42 minutes long . So a 45-minute Direct for a whole new Sakurai game suddenly doesn't seem as excessive. A release date for Kirby Air Riders seems like a safe bet for this Direct. The timing of the showcase is pretty interesting too, as it will air just before Gamescom gets underway. Perhaps Kirby Air Riders will be playable at Nintendo's booth at the event.

While some discounts are reserved for students, others are available to everyone. One of the best right now is on Apple's M3-powered iPad Air , which is somewhat of a goldilocks tablet — one that will be a great option for just about everyone. You can grab it for $150 off at Amazon right now. This deal applies to each configuration of the 11-inch and 13-inch versions of the most recent iPad Air. So, the 11-inch model is as low as $449, while the 13-inch model is down to $649. The same deals can be found at Best Buy and Target if you prefer to shop somewhere other than Amazon. This is an all-time low price and beats the deal we saw on Prime Day by $30. The iPad Air M3 is more of an iterative refresh than a grand overhaul, but the spec bump means it’ll last you a long time before the tablet’s performance becomes a problem. This iPad occupies the position of \"best for most\" in our iPad buying guide , reinforcing that goldilocks analogy. The M3 chip is the main draw here, with Geekbench 6 scores proclaiming it around 16 percent more powerful than the M2 iPad Air, which is no slouch itself. Beyond the chip, it has a superior display and speakers to the entry-level model , and wider accessory support. You also get the option of a 13-inch display, which is great for artists or anyone who sees the iPad as a viable laptop replacement. If there’s an obvious downside to the iPad Air M3, it’s that it doesn't have the nice 120Hz OLED display of the iPad Pro. This is hardly surprising, as Apple often focuses on display tech to differentiate its Pro and non-Pro devices, but it’s probably time the refresh rate on the middle-of-the-road iPad at least jumped up to ProMotion. Face ID is long overdue too. If you can live with these caveats, though, the iPad Air is an excellent option, particularly at this price. If you think the Air is too much for your needs, the iPad A16 , Apple's entry-level tablet, is down to $299 right now. It was slightly cheaper during Prime Day in July, but this discount is still worth considering if you're looking to pick up a newer iPad for less.

This year, the company is adding a third, more affordable option to its earbuds family with the Galaxy Buds 3 FE ($150) . This so-called \"fan edition\" carries a \"blade\" design similar to the existing Galaxy Buds 3 duo, but has the ear tip fit akin to the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro. Active noise cancellation (ANC) is still in the mix here, even with the lower price, and a solid list of features make these an option to consider for owners of a recent Galaxy phone. The Galaxy Buds 3 FE are the successor to the the Galaxy Buds FE that debuted in 2023 . As such, many of the company's comparisons and claims about improvements are pitted against the performance of that model. That previous version came before Samsung swapped over to the AirPods-like stem design, or \"blade\" as the company describes it, so this new FE edition looks very different from its predecessor. The onboard controls are situated along that stem like the rest of the Galaxy Buds 3 line, including audio playback and volume adjustments. Samsung's Galaxy Buds 3 FE have a similar \"blade\" design to the existing Galaxy Buds 3 duo Samsung To improve call quality on the Galaxy Buds 3 FE, Samsung says it relocated the voice microphones to the stem so they're closer to the user's mouth. The company also explains that it made changes to audio quality thanks to larger speakers than the previous FE version for \"powerful sound with deep bass and clear treble.\" There's also \"enhanced\" ANC and the aforementioned call upgrades include noise reduction technology that can isolate your voice in less-than-ideal environments. Another slight improvement is in the area of battery life. The Galaxy Buds 3 FE can last up to eight and a half hours with ANC off, or up to 30 hours total when you factor in the charging case. That's 90 minutes longer than the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro. With ANC enabled, battery life compared to the current Pro model is unchanged at six hours (24 hours total with the case). Lastly, the ingress protection isn't quite as robust as the Galaxy Buds 3 and Galaxy Buds 3 Pro. Those two sets of earbuds are IP57 rated for dust protection and water immersion. However, the Galaxy Buds 3 FE is IP54 rated, so it's only promised to withstand water splashes. The Galaxy Buds 3 FE will be available on September 4 for $150 in Black and Gray color options.

Not only was it a worthy alternative to Samsung's long-running Galaxy Z Fold phones, its straightforward design once again proved that keeping things simple is often the wisest way to go. It turns out, the best approach to foldable phone design is to make something that's the same size and shape as a regular handset, but just happens to have a big flexible display hidden inside. However, after using the Pixel 9 Pro Fold (which I will refer to as the P9PF for short) for just shy of a year, I wanted to re-review the device to reflect on how it held up after 11 months of wear and tear and to consider what Google might be able to improve on the next model. Design and features Sam Rutherford for Engadget Google figured out something when it shifted away from the short and squat dimensions of the original Pixel Fold for its second foldable phone. By making the Pixel 9 Pro Fold's exterior display essentially the same size as a normal Pixel 9, the company eliminated any confusion for when you just want to quickly send a text, check a map or doomscroll on social media. The obvious downside to this is that when you open the phone up, its interior display has essentially a square aspect ratio, which isn't great for watching movies. However, with an increased size of eight inches across, the P9PF still has one of the largest flexible panels around, so it's not like anyone was really hurting for screen real estate. And for stuff like games, comics or ebooks, it's arguably even better. If manufacturers were able to bring the price of foldables down, they might kill the market for small tablets (nine inches and under) overnight. On top of that, unlike Samsung’s foldables, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold didn't really sacrifice on camera quality or features. It has a 5x optical zoom just like you get on a standard Pixel 9 Pro, and while it doesn't have the same main sensor, you'd be hard-pressed to tell unless you do some serious side-by-side pixel peeping. Plus, you get fun tools like Look at Me that are only possible due to its foldable design, not to mention other nifty features like Add Me. Sam Rutherford for Engadget Granted, Google's Tensor G4 chip lags behind equivalent Qualcomm Snapdragon processors. But it's still fast enough for everything I’ve thrown at it, aside from maybe hardcore video editing or the most demanding games. And I maintain that foldable phones are still the best devices for mobile trading card apps like Marvel Snap or Pokémon TCG Pocket . The presence of a big screen that can be deployed or hidden away at a moment's notice is perfect for matches that only last a couple of minutes, so you can squeeze a round in pretty much anywhere or any time. Durability I'm not a fan of cases. That’s true even on foldables, because while they are more fragile than a typical smartphone, the added bulk and heft that comes with most aftermarket protectors are just kind of annoying. Furthermore, especially in recent years, most foldables are generally tough enough to withstand life's everyday drops and tumbles. Unless you're out there regularly burying your phone in the sand or dropping it on concrete, my experience with previous foldables (from both Samsung and Google ) has me feeling relatively confident about their overall durability. Sam Rutherford for Engadget That said, I did make one small change when living with the P9PF. Instead of a case, I installed a skin from Dbrand (which I bought myself) to give the phone a tiny extra cushion in the back. Granted, there are still several scratches and dings on its frame and front screen. But that was kind of the point. I wanted to see how Google's second-gen foldable would hold up with minimal protection and this phone has probably taken more of a beating than any device I've owned to date. Fun fact: I shot and edited the review photos for the Pixel 9 Pro Fold just an hour before I had to go to the hospital for the birth of my daughter. And in the time since, the P9PF has been spat up on, crawled on, walked on by my three-year-old son and fallen out of my pocket during bathtime a countless number of times. And for the most part, it's taken those hits like a boxer with an iron chin (or in Google's case, aluminum). Sam Rutherford for Engadget If you're really trying to maximize resale value, you may want something more substantial. For everyone else, the addition of a skin and a screen protector for its exterior display is all you really need. My Pixel 9 Pro Fold's interior screen is still pristine after almost a year. Yes, it has a crease, but if that's an issue, you may never be able to own a foldable phone. Or at the very least, not in the near future. Meanwhile, the blemishes elsewhere aren't distracting enough to make using the P9PF any less enjoyable. Though everyone is different, so you may feel otherwise. Potential concerns The one potential issue going forward is that in just the last couple of weeks, I've noticed the phone occasionally takes longer to turn on the inner display after opening it up. It doesn’t happen every time and it'll usually fix itself in a few seconds or after a couple taps. Furthermore, sometimes the phone's SIM card will stop working too, which can be addressed by resetting the Pixel's internet connections. Sam Rutherford for Engadget While I haven't been able to confirm if this is due to a software update (like a recent Android patch) or something loose inside (possibly a shaky display cable), it sounds very similar to a thread I spotted recently on Reddit . Based on the post, the owner of that P9PF takes much better care of their phone than I do, which suggests the cause may be related to build quality or its underlying design instead of simple wear and tear. Regardless, if you own a Pixel 9 Pro Fold and have also run into this issue, let me know so I can investigate this further. Future outlook Even with a possible service call clouding the future of my Pixel 9 Pro Fold, I've thoroughly enjoyed my time with it over the last year. Pairing a bigger flexible screen with best-in-class cameras and a simple but very effective design is a winning formula for a modern foldable. And while I don't expect a full redesign this year after the big jump we got from the OG Pixel Fold, if Google can tweak little things like the awkward-looking corner in the top left of its exterior display, improve durability and maybe increase the battery capacity in addition to its usual assortment of yearly AI-powered tools and features, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold could be a very solid followup. I took the skin off for this story and as you can see, it did a good job of protecting the backside of the phone. Sam Rutherford for Engadget However, the arrival of the Galaxy Z Fold 7 means Google has some work to do. I'm waiting to see what the next foldable Pixel brings (and hopefully the OnePlus Open 2 as well) before picking which phone I want to use for the next year. Unless Google or OnePlus can match the exquisite thinness, excellent performance and improved battery life on Samsung's latest flagship, I feel like I'm going to be doing the gadget version of the distracted boyfriend meme every time I go to pick up a significantly thicker rival. That said, things like Google's software and superior cameras might pull me back. But perhaps the most impressive thing is that after just two generations, the Pixel Fold line has almost completely caught up to the latest Z Fold with the chance to pull ahead next week. And for anyone who's ever considering getting a foldable phone (or maybe even their second, third or fourth), that's exactly the kind of competition I like to see.

The Outlander Electric is designed to be \"whisper quiet\" for chores like herding or hunting, but it can actually tow more than its gas-powered counterparts thanks to the high level of torque. Powered by BRP's modular Rotax E-Power drivetrain (also used in the company's electric snowmobiles and motorbikes), the Outlander Electric makes up to 47 hp and 53 lb-ft of torque, the latter of which is substantially more than any of the company's ICE-powered ATVs. As a result, the electric model offers 1,830 pounds of towing capacity, the most of any ATV, according to the company. BRP Inc. The 8.9 kWh battery offers about 50 miles (80 km) of range, around half of what a gasoline ATV will get depending on the model. It can be charged from 20 to 80 percent in around 50 minutes using a Level 2 charger. Other features include selectable ride modes (Normal, Sport and Work) depending on whether you're trail riding or towing items around your ranch, 12-inches of clearance and a two-speed transmission. However, the key benefit Can-Am is touting is the lack of noise due to the liquid-cooling system, optimized suspension and special tires. With that, the Outlander Electric is less likely to spook farm animals or wildlife, making it a good option for farmers, hunters and park rangers. The Can-Am Outlander Electric ATV is now available from deals and Can'Am's website starting at $12,999 .

Right now, the 2025 13- and 15-inch MacBook Air M4 are available on Amazon for record-low prices. The 13-inch model is our pick for best MacBook to buy this year, and it's one of the best laptops for college students going back to school soon as well. You can pick up the 13-inch MacBook Air M4 for $799, down from $999 — a 20 percent discount. This model comes with 16GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD. You can upgrade to 512GB SSD for $999 , down from $1,199, another all-time low price, or 24GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD for $1,199, down from $1,399. Then there's the 15-inch MacBook Air M4 , whose cheapest model is on sale for $999, dropping from $1,199. The 17 percent discount is the best deal we've seen since the pair debuted in March. As with the 13-inch model, the 16GB and 512GB SSD option is also a record-low price, dropping to $1,199 from $1,399. Then there's the 24GB upgrade , which is $1,399, down from $1,599. We're big fans of the MacBook Air M4, giving it a 92 in our review . Part of that comes from an already lower starting price for the MacBooks than their predecessors. The 2025 models also get a speed boost thanks to the M4 chip and are very thin with a 0.44-inch thickness. Neither the 13- or 15-inch will drag you down, weighing 2.7 pounds and 3.2 pounds, respectively. Plus, they both have excellent battery life, lasting over 18 hours while playing an HD video. The big differences in the 15-inch model mostly come down to size. The screen is obviously bigger, as is its trackpad. Other than that, it offers better speakers than its 13-inch sibling.

It stems from deals Google undertook with Australian telecommunications companies Telstra and Optus to only pre-install Google Search. The key there is that these companies couldn't install any other search engine. Telstra and Optus then got a share of Google's ad revenue from customers using Google search on their respective Androids. Google admitted these agreements were \"likely to have had the effect of substantially lessening competition.\" These deals were in place from December 2019 to March 2021. \"Conduct that restricts competition is illegal in Australia because it usually means less choice, higher costs or worse service for consumers,\" ACCC Chair Gina-Cass Gottlieb said before turning the emphasis to AI. \"Importantly, these changes come at a time when AI search tools are revolutionising how we search for information, creating new competition. With AI search tools becoming increasingly available, consumers can experiment with search services on their mobiles.\" Unlike some past instances in which Google has defended itself against an investigation or fine, the company is cooperating. It has admitted liability and proposed the fine alongside the ACCC. A court will determine whether its an apt punishment. Google has offered a range of search provider options to EU Android users since 2020 — after facing another antitrust ruling and a €4.3 billion ($5 billion) fine. Last year, Telstra and Optus came to agreements with the ACCC that they wouldn't make similar arrangements with Google moving forward.

Smooth gameplay, low input lag and crisp visuals are just the start. With the right screen, everything from your aim to your immersion gets a serious upgrade. These days, there’s a lot more to consider than just refresh rate or screen size. You’ll find ultrawide gaming monitors, widescreen displays, models with USB-C support, and monitors that can bring out the best in your CPU and GPU. Some even match the style of your setup, pairing perfectly with gaming headsets and accessories for a clean, cohesive look. Whether you're shopping on a tighter price range or splurging on high-end picture quality, we’ve rounded up the best options to suit different setups and play styles — so you can level up your experience without the guesswork. Table of contents Best gaming monitors for 2025 How we test gaming monitors Factors to consider before buying a gaming monitor Gaming monitor FAQs Best gaming monitors for 2025 How we test gaming monitors While I’ve not used every product recommended in our list, I have extensively tested dozens of gaming monitors in the past, including models with WOLED and QD-OLED panels. In the case of the Alienware monitor I highlight above, I bought one for myself with my own money. Separately, I spent dozens of hours over a two-year period researching computer monitor options to write the current version of this guide. Factors to consider before buying a gaming monitor LCD vs OLED When shopping for a gaming monitor, you first need to decide if you want to go with a screen that has an LCD or OLED panel. For most people, that choice will come down to price; OLED gaming monitors are more expensive than their LCD counterparts. Even if money isn’t a concern, the choice might not be as straightforward as you think; both LCD and OLED panels come in a few different flavors, and knowing the differences between each type is important to making an informed decision. LCD monitors come in three different varieties: twisted nematic (TN), vertical alignment (VA) or in-plane switching (IPS). For the most part, you want to avoid TN monitors unless you’re strapped for cash or want a monitor with the fastest possible refresh rate or fast response rate. TN screens feature the worst viewing angles, contrast ratios and colors of the group. The differences between VA and IPS panels are more subtle. Historically, VA gaming monitors featured slower pixel response times than their TN and IPS counterparts, leading to unsightly image smearing. However, that’s improved in recent years. VA panels also frequently sport better contrast ratios than both TN and IPS screens. They’re not dramatically better than their IPS siblings on that front, but when contrast ratios aren’t an inherent strength of LCDs, every bit helps. On the other hand, IPS panels excel at color accuracy and many offer high refresh rates and response times that are as fast as the fastest TN panels. The majority of LCD gaming monitors on the market today feature IPS panels, though you will frequently find VA screens on ultrawide monitors. What about OLED? If you can afford one, an OLED screen makes for the best monitor for gaming. The ability of organic light-emitting diodes to produce true blacks is transformational. Simply put, every game looks better when there isn’t a backlight to wash out shadow detail. Plus, you can experience true HDR with an OLED screen, something that LCDs aren’t known for. Today, OLED screens come in two different flavors: WOLED and QD-OLED, with LG producing the former and Samsung the latter. I won’t bore you with the technical details of how the two panel types differ from one another other than to note both technologies broadly offer the same set of shortcomings. Most notably, OLED monitors don’t get very bright. At best, the most capable models peak at around 250 nits when measuring brightness across the entire screen. I didn’t find this to be an issue in my testing, but your experience may vary depending on the ambient light in your gaming setup. If brightness is important to you, note that due to manufacturer tunings, different models can perform better than others, even if they feature the same panel from LG or Samsung. It’s worth comparing monitors in the same class to find the model that’s right for you. Separately, almost all OLEDs feature sub-pixel layouts that produce text fringing in Windows. The latest generation of OLED panels from both LG and Samsung are much better in this regard, to the point where modern OLEDs are good enough for reading and image editing. However, it’s still worth going to your local Micro Center or Best Buy to see the model you want in person, as the text fringing issue is hard to capture in photos and videos. Another (potentially more serious) issue is burn-in. Organic light-emitting diodes can get “stuck” if they display the same image for long periods of time. Every OLED gaming monitor you can buy today comes with features designed to prevent burn-in and other image quality issues. Provided you don’t use your new OLED monitor for eight hours of daily productivity work, I don’t think you need to worry about burn-in too much. Screen size, resolution and aspect ratio After deciding where you fall on the LCD vs OLED debate, you can start thinking about the size of your future gaming monitor. Personal preference and the limitations of your gaming setup will play a big part here, but there are also a few technical considerations. You should think about size in conjunction with resolution and aspect ratio. A 1440p monitor has 78 percent more pixels than a 1080p resolution screen, and a 4K display has more than twice as many pixels as a QHD panel. As the size of a monitor increases, pixel density decreases unless you also increase resolution. For that reason, there are sweet spots between size and high resolution. For instance, I wouldn’t recommend buying an FHD monitor that is larger than 24 inches or a QHD one bigger than 27 inches. Conversely, text and interface elements on a 4K monitor can look tiny without scaling on panels smaller than 32 inches. You also need to consider the performance costs of running games at higher resolutions. The latest entry-level GPUs can comfortably run most modern games at 1080p and 60 frames per second. They can even render some competitive titles at 120 frames per second and higher — but push them to run those same games at 1440p and beyond, and you’re bound to run into problems. And as you’ll see in a moment, a consistently high frame rate is vital to getting the most out of the latest gaming monitors. If your budget allows for it, 1440p offers the best balance between image quality and gaming performance. As for 1080p resolution and 4K, I would only consider the former if you’re on a tight budget or enjoy competitive gaming shooters like Valorant and Overwatch 2 . For most people, the user experience and productivity benefits of QHD far outweigh the performance gains you get from going with a lower resolution screen. Just a few years ago, 4K was not a viable resolution for PC gaming, but then NVIDIA came out with its 40 series GPUs . With those video cards offering the company’s DLSS 3 frame generation technology, there’s a case to be made that the technology is finally there to play 4K games at a reasonable frame rate, particularly if you exclusively play big, AAA single-player games like Alan Wake 2 and Cyberpunk 2077 or enjoy strategy games like the Total War series. However, even with frame generation, you will need a GPU like the $999 RTX 4080 Super or $1,599 RTX 4090 to drive a 4K display. Plus, 4K gaming monitors tend to cost more than their 1440p counterparts. If you want an ultrawide, note that not every game supports the 21:9 aspect ratio, and fewer still support 32:9. When shopping for a curved monitor, a lower Radius, or ‘R’ number, indicates a more aggressive curve. So, a 1000R monitor is more curved than an 1800R one. Photo by Igor Bonifacic / Engadget Refresh rates and response times And now, finally, for the fun stuff. The entire reason to buy a gaming monitor is for its ability to draw more images than a traditional computer monitor. As you shop for a new screen, you will see models advertising refresh rates like 120Hz, 240Hz and 360Hz. The higher the refresh rate of a monitor, the more times it can update the image it displays on screen every second, thereby producing a smoother moving image. When it comes to games like Overwatch , Valorant and League of Legends , a faster refresh rate can give you a competitive edge, but even immersive single-player games can benefit. A monitor with a 240Hz refresh rate will look better in motion than one with a 120Hz refresh rate, but there are diminishing returns. At 60Hz, the image you see on your computer monitor is updated every 16.67ms. At 120Hz, 240Hz and 360Hz, the gap between new frames shortens to 8.33ms, 4.17ms and 2.78ms, respectively. Put another way, although a 360Hz monitor can display 50 percent more frames than a 240Hz screen in a given time period, you will only see a speedup of 1.14ms between frame intervals. And all that depends on your GPU’s ability to render a consistent 360 frames per second. Ultimately, a fast response monitor will do you no good if you don't have a gaming PC with a graphics card that can keep up. For example, with a 1440p 360Hz monitor, you realistically need a GPU like the RTX 4070 Super or RTX 4080 Super to saturate that display while playing competitive gaming titles like Overwatch 2 and Valorant . There’s also more to motion clarity than refresh rates alone. Just as important are fast response times, or the amount of time it takes for pixels to transition from one color to another and then back again. Monitors with slow response times tend to produce smearing that is distracting no matter what kind of game you’re playing. Curved gaming monitor options help with immersion by wrapping the screen around your field of vision, making the gaming setup feel more expansive. Unfortunately, response times are also one of the more opaque aspects of picking the best gaming monitor for your needs. Many LCD monitor manufacturers claim their products feature 1ms gray-to-gray (GtG) response times, yet they don’t handle motion blur to the same standard. One of the reasons for that is that many companies tend to cherry-pick GtG results that make their monitors look better on paper. The Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA) recently created a new certification program to address that problem, but the grading system is unwieldy and, as far as I can tell, hasn’t had a lot of pickup from manufacturers. For now, your best bet is to turn to resources like Rtings and Monitors Unboxed when shopping for a new gaming monitor. Both outlets conduct extensive testing of every screen they review and present their findings and recommendations in a way that’s easy to understand. FreeSync vs G-Sync No matter how powerful your system, it will sometimes fail to maintain a consistent framerate. In fact, you should expect frame rate fluctuations when playing graphically-intensive games like Alan Wake 2 and Cyberpunk 2077 . For those moments, you want a gaming display with adaptive sync. Otherwise, you can run into screen tearing. Adaptive sync technologies come in a few flavors. The two you’re most likely to encounter are AMD FreeSync and NVIDIA G-Sync, and each has its own set of performance tiers. With G-Sync, for instance, they are – from lowest to highest – G-Sync Compatible, G-Sync and G-Sync Ultimate. The good news is that you don’t need to think too much about which adaptive sync technology a display supports. In the early days of the tech, it was rare to see a gaming monitor that offered both FreeSync and G-Sync since including the latter meant a manufacturer had to equip their display with a dedicated processor from NVIDIA. That changed in 2019 when the company introduced its G-Sync Compatible certification . Today, if a monitor supports FreeSync, it is almost certainly G-Sync Compatible, too, meaning you can enjoy tear-free gaming whether you’re using an AMD or NVIDIA GPU. In fact, I would go so far as to say you shouldn’t make your purchasing decision based on the level of adaptive sync performance a monitor offers. As of right now, the list of G-Sync Ultimate-certified displays is about two dozen models long, and some are a few years old now. Photo by Igor Bonifacic / Engadget Inputs Almost every gaming display on the market right now comes with at least one DisplayPort 1.4 connection, and that’s the port you will want to use to connect your new monitor to your graphics card. If you own a PS5 or Xbox Series X/S , it’s also worth looking out for monitors that come with HDMI 2.1 ports, as those will allow you to get the most out of your current generation console. A word about HDR As fast and responsive gaming monitors have become in recent years, there’s one area where progress has been frustratingly slow: HDR performance. The majority of gaming monitors currently on sale, including most high-end models, only meet VESA’s DisplayHDR 400 certification. As someone who owned one such monitor, let me tell you it’s not even worth turning on HDR on those screens. You will only be disappointed. The good news is that things are getting better, albeit slowly. The release of Windows 11 did a lot to improve the state of HDR on PC, and more games are shipping with competent HDR modes, not just ones that increase the brightness of highlights. Thankfully, with more affordable mini-LED monitors, like our top pick, making their way to the market, HDR gaming is finally within reach of most PC gamers. Gaming monitor FAQs Are curved monitors better for gaming? It depends on personal preference. Many manufacturers claim curved monitors offer a more immersive gaming experience due to the way the display wraps around your field of vision. However, I find the edge distortion distracting, particularly when you increase the field of view in a game. What aspect ratio should I look for in a gaming monitor? The vast majority of 24-, 27- and 32-inch gaming monitors feature 16:9 aspect ratio panels, and that’s been the case for many years. In fact, nearly every game made in the last two decades supports 16:9 resolutions, such as 1,920 x 1,080 and 2,560 by 1,440, and if you buy a standard-sized monitor, you won’t need to worry about letterboxing. In the case of ultrawides, 21:9 is the most common aspect ratio, with some very wide models sporting 32:9 panels. Among games, support for 21:9 and 32:9 resolutions is far from universal, so don’t be surprised if a game doesn’t fill the entirety of your screen. Is OLED good for gaming? OLED monitors are great for gaming. Not only do they offer excellent motion clarity and input latency, but they’re also easily the best displays for HDR gaming. If money is no object, and you primarily use your PC for gaming, you can’t go wrong with an OLED monitor. How much does a good gaming monitor cost? While you could easily spend more than $1,000 to obtain the best gaming monitor on the market now, the reality is that the budget and midrange categories have never been more competitive. In 2015, I spent $500 CAD to buy a 1080p monitor with a 144Hz refresh rate and TN panel. The budget AOC model I highlight above is not only cheaper than my first gaming monitor, but it also features a faster 180Hz refresh rate and a higher contrast VA panel.

But if you’re one of the millions who have an Android smartphone, figuring out which set to grab isn’t as obvious. If you need a hand, allow us to point you in the right direction. We’ve tested and reviewed dozens of wireless earbuds over the years and broken down our favorite options for Android users below. Whether you use a Galaxy or a Pixel phone, and whether you want something for the gym or your morning commute, here are the best AirPods alternatives for Android. Table of contents The best Android earbuds for 2025 What to look for in wireless earbuds for Android devices How we test Android earbuds Recent updates Best Android earbuds for 2025 What to look for in wireless earbuds for Android devices Photo by Jeff Dunn / Engadget For the most part, the features you want from a set of “Android earbuds” are the same as what you want from any headphones. Great sound quality, a comfortable fit and sufficient battery life are still the foundations. Adequate water resistance is good for workouts, and nobody wants a crummy mic for making calls. Once you approach the $100 range, features like active noise cancellation (ANC), wireless charging, an ambient sound mode (which lets you better hear outside noise without turning off your music) and multipoint connectivity (the ability to pair with multiple devices simultaneously) should be expected. For Android devices specifically, there are a few extras to consider. A dedicated app that makes it easy to switch sound modes, customize the audio profile, locate your earbuds if they ever get misplaced or adjust other settings is strongly preferred. Features like Google Fast Pair or NFC-based pairing, which can help you avoid having to dig through your Bluetooth menu to connect your earbuds for the first time, are also nice perks. Some Android devices can also utilize higher-quality Bluetooth codecs such as aptX Adaptive or Sony’s LDAC — these aren’t nearly as important to audio quality as the actual architecture of your earbuds, but they can help wring out a little more detail if the buds are capable enough and you’re streaming lossless files. AptX Adaptive can also help reduce latency, which is good for streaming video or gaming. Diversity is Android’s greatest strength, but it also means that some wireless earbuds play nicer with certain devices, typically those made by the same company. Recent Samsung earbuds, for instance, come with a few perks that are only available if you use a Galaxy phone. We have a couple of recommendations related to this idea above. How we test Android earbuds Photo by Billy Steele/Engadget The best way to test earphones is simply to wear them as much as possible, so that’s what we do. We typically do this over a one- to two-week period, though embargo times occasionally force us to finish our review process a bit faster. We listen to a test playlist that includes several musical genres and podcasts, paying close attention to how each pair approaches the bass, mid and treble frequencies to get an accurate sense of its sound profile. We also test at high and low volumes to check for consistency in the tuning. We do not have access to a dummy head to take more objective measurements, but we’ll sometimes look to sites like Rtings , SoundGuys and others that do just to ensure our impressions are not wildly off-base. If a model supports custom EQ, we’ll tinker with that and use the available EQ presets to see if one sounds dramatically better than the others — though in general we base most of our impressions on the stock tuning each pair uses by default. To assess microphone quality, we record our own audio samples and take multiple calls with a partner both indoors and outside. For battery life, we play our test playlist on a loop with the volume around 75 percent and measure how long it takes for each set to drain. Where applicable, we do a thorough review of a pair’s companion app and test each available feature. While comfort is ultimately subjective, we take note of how secure each pair feels while we’re on the move. We also use certain pairs in especially crowded public spaces to get a better sense of their passive and active noise cancellation, as well as their ability to maintain a consistent Bluetooth connection. Recent updates August 2025 : We’ve taken another sweep to ensure our advice is still up-to-date. May 2025 : We’ve checked this guide to ensure our top picks still stand and noted a couple alternatives to the Noble Fokus Rex5, since that pair has had stock issues of late. We’re also keeping an eye on how the Trump administration’s tariff policy affects the pricing and stock of our recommendations (and the consumer tech industry as a whole). All of our picks are still available in their normal price ranges today, but we’ll update this guide if that changes. February 2025 : The Noble FoKus Rex5 is our new \"best for sound quality\" pick, replacing the Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 4. Our other recommendations remain unchanged. December 2024 : We’ve lightly edited this guide for clarity and ensured that our current picks are still accurate.

Trump appeared deferential to the Russian leader and now backs plans to hand over Ukrainian territory as part of a peace deal. Today he will meet with Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders.

The three-day robotics event in Beijing, China that saw humanoid robots compete in everything from boxing to cleaning concluded this weekend. According to the World Humanoid Robot Games, more than 280 teams from 16 countries, including the US, Germany, Brazil and the host country, entered their robots into the event. A majority of the teams came from universities, but several teams came from established robotics companies like Unitree and Fournier Intelligence. Hundreds of robots competed in traditional sporting events like running, soccer and table tennis, along with events for more practical tasks, like cleaning or sorting medicine. Unitree snagged gold medals in four categories, including the 1,500-meter, 400-meter, 100-meter, and 4x100-meter dash events. According to Unitree, the fastest speed achieved by one of its robots during the event was 4.78 m/s, which is roughly 10 mph. In the 100-meter sprint, Unitree boasted a 33.71-second time, but that's nowhere near the world record holder Usain Bolt's time of 9.58 seconds , which was achieved in 2009. Instead, most teams took this event as an opportunity to showcase the abilities of their designs, while also stress-testing their robots in a competitive environment. We're still a long way from widespread adoption of these humanoid bots though, especially if they can't avoid running into each other .

The three-day robotics event in Beijing, China that saw humanoid robots compete in everything from boxing to cleaning concluded this weekend. According to the World Humanoid Robot Games, more than 280 teams from 16 countries, including the US, Germany, Brazil and the host country, entered their robots into the event. A majority of the teams came from universities, but several teams came from established robotics companies like Unitree and Fournier Intelligence. Hundreds of robots competed in traditional sporting events like running, soccer and table tennis, along with events for more practical tasks, like cleaning or sorting medicine. Unitree snagged gold medals in four categories, including the 1,500-meter, 400-meter, 100-meter, and 4x100-meter dash events. According to Unitree, the fastest speed achieved by one of its robots during the event was 4.78 m/s, which is roughly 10 mph. In the 100-meter sprint, Unitree boasted a 33.71-second time, but that's nowhere near the world record holder Usain Bolt's time of 9.58 seconds , which was achieved in 2009. Instead, most teams took this event as an opportunity to showcase the abilities of their designs, while also stress-testing their robots in a competitive environment. We're still a long way from widespread adoption of these humanoid bots though, especially if they can't avoid running into each other .

The company announced in a post on its website that the Claude Opus 4 and 4.1 models now have the power to end a conversation with users. According to Anthropic, this feature will only be used in \"rare, extreme cases of persistently harmful or abusive user interactions.\" To clarify, Anthropic said those two Claude models could exit harmful conversations, like \"requests from users for sexual content involving minors and attempts to solicit information that would enable large-scale violence or acts of terror.\" With Claude Opus 4 and 4.1, these models will only end a conversation \"as a last resort when multiple attempts at redirection have failed and hope of a productive interaction has been exhausted,\" according to Anthropic. However, Anthropic claims most users won't experience Claude cutting a conversation short, even when talking about highly controversial topics, since this feature will be reserved for \"extreme edge cases.\" Anthropic In the scenarios where Claude ends a chat, users can no longer send any new messages in that conversation, but can start a new one immediately. Anthropic added that if a conversation is ended, it won't affect other chats and users can even go back and edit or retry previous messages to steer towards a different conversational route. For Anthropic, this move is part of its research program that studies the idea of AI welfare. While the idea of anthropomorphizing AI models remains an ongoing debate, the company said the ability to exit a \"potentially distressing interaction\" was a low-cost way to manage risks for AI welfare. Anthropic is still experimenting with this feature and encourages its users to provide feedback when they encounter such a scenario.

One you might be thrilled to play around with is the visual update: Liquid Glass . (It's like the better-executed version of Windows Vista .) We spent two weeks test-driving it — you can check out our detailed hands-on iOS 26 preview , or you can try it out yourself by downloading and installing the public beta 2 . That software is a more stable iteration of the separate developer version, which recently hit the beta 6 waypoint, and offers a few more flashy features not yet available in the public version. (While the public beta is open to everyone and quite stable, always remember there's a degree of risk involved with beta software.) Additionally, there are credible reports that iOS 26 could bring a new live translation feature to AirPods , too. Not ready to upgrade your smartphone or tablet this year? No worries, we'll help you find out if your devices will be able to run iOS 26. While Apple didn't nix any iPhones from its eligibility list last year, that's not the case for 2025 — a few models are getting cut this time. All iPhone 8 models and the iPhone X were the last to get the boot in 2023, and this year the 2018 models are getting left behind. If you have an ineligible device, you won't be able to download iOS 26 when it becomes available this fall. We'll get to the bottom of which iPhones and iPads will support iOS 26 and iPadOS 26 this year. To see what's coming with the latest OSes, check out everything announced at Apple's WWDC June 9 event . One thing you shouldn't immediately expect is Apple's updated version of Siri , though the company is reportedly working on a 'stripped-down' AI chatbot to compete with ChatGPT. These three iPhones won't be compatible with iOS 26 Unlike last year, several iPhone models won't be eligible to download the newest iOS when it makes its debut this fall. This trio of models first released in 2018 won't be coming to the iOS 26 party: iPhone XR iPhone XS iPhone XS Max iPhones compatible with iOS 26 While we don't yet know the new iPhones Apple will be dropping this fall — though there are iPhone 17 rumors — we do know, per Apple's site , that the phones listed below will be compatible with iOS 26. Basically, if you have an iPhone that was announced in 2019 or later, you're in the clear: iPhone SE (second generation or later) iPhone 11 iPhone 11 Pro iPhone 11 Pro Max iPhone 12 iPhone 12 mini iPhone 12 Pro iPhone 12 Pro Max iPhone 13 iPhone 13 mini iPhone 13 Pro iPhone 13 Pro Max iPhone 14 iPhone 14 Plus iPhone 14 Pro iPhone 14 Pro Max iPhone 15 iPhone 15 Plus iPhone 15 Pro iPhone 15 Pro Max iPhone 16 iPhone 16 Plus iPhone 16 Pro iPhone 16 Pro Max iPhone 16e iPads compatible with iPadOS 26 The iPads listed below, and any iPads released later this year, are eligible to download iPadOS 26 . iPad Pro (M4) iPad Pro 12.9‑inch (3rd generation and later) iPad Pro 11‑inch (1st generation and later) iPad Air (3rd generation and later, including M2 and M3) iPad (8th generation and later, including A16) iPad mini (5th generation and later, including A17 Pro) What if I don't want to buy a new iPhone? If you want to continue using your older iPhone that isn't supported by iOS 26, that's fine. However, you'll miss out on security updates which could potentially put your phone at risk for malware and other threats. Additionally, some apps may stop working if they require a certain version of iOS or later. And of course, you won't be able to access the latest features iOS 26 offers. When will iOS 26 become available? Apple usually rolls out its latest iOS in mid-September, just a few days before the new iPhones hit store shelves. Last year, it released iOS 18 on Monday, Sept. 16. Expect a confirmation of the release date at the iPhone 17 event, expected in early September. iOS 26 features we're excited about Liquid Glass design : Your home screen is getting revamped with new app icons, including dark mode and all-clear options. You'll also notice buttons with a new floating design. Liquid Glass was designed to make all of Apple's OSes more cohesive. Phone app redesign: You'll finally be able to scroll through contacts, recent calls and voicemail messages all on one screen. It also comes with a new feature called Hold Assist that'll notify you when an agent comes to the phone so you can avoid the elevator music. Live Translate: iOS 26 is bringing the ability to have a conversation via phone call or text message with someone who speaks another language. Live Translate will translate your conversation in real time. Polls feature: Coming to group messages in the Messages app, chat members will be able to create polls. This can help prevent the unwanted 30+ messages when it comes to deciding which restaurant you're meeting at this weekend.

To address recent concerns, Roblox published a post on its website detailing these major changes, including restricting all unrated experiences, which is what Roblox calls its user-generated games, to the developer or those actively working with them. Roblox said this change will roll out in the coming months, representing a big shift from its previous policy that allowed users 13 or older to access unrated experiences. To further prevent any inappropriate behavior, any \"social hangout\" experiences that depict private spaces, like bedrooms or bathrooms, will be limited to ID-verified users who are 17 or older. Roblox will also restrict social hangout games that mostly take place in those previously-mentioned private spaces or adult-only places, like bars or clubs, to users who are at least 17 and have been ID-verified. To assist with the new rules, Roblox will roll out a new tool that automatically detects \"violative scenes,\" or more simply, user activity that goes against the rules. According to Roblox's new policies, a server that hits enough violations will automatically get taken down and will have to work with the Roblox team to adjust the experience and get it back online. These policy changes come after several lawsuits were filed against Roblox that claim the game doesn't protect its younger users. In response to the lawsuit filed by Louisiana's attorney general, Roblox wrote in a separate post that it works to block any efforts at exploitative behavior and constantly enhances its moderation approaches. \"Any assertion that Roblox would intentionally put our users at risk of exploitation is simply untrue,\" the company statement read. \"No system is perfect and bad actors adapt to evade detection, including efforts to take users to other platforms, where safety standards and moderation practices may differ.

In 2023, Elon Musk's X filed a lawsuit against the media watchdog following an advertiser exodus. It accused Media Matters of \"knowingly and maliciously manufactur[ing] side-by-side images depicting advertisers' posts on X Corp.'s social media platform beside Neo-Nazi and white national fringe content.\" Just this May, the FTC started looking into whether the nonprofit violated antitrust laws by allegedly colluding with advertising and advocacy groups to boycott X. In June, Media Matters sued the FTC , accusing it of unfairly targeting the group in retaliation for past criticisms of X. \"The Federal Trade Commission seeks to punish Media Matters for its journalism and speech in exposing matters of substantial public concern — including how X.com has enabled and profited from extremist content that proliferated after Elon Musk took over the platform formerly known as Twitter,\" the group said at the time. Now, Judge Sparkle L. Sooknanan has granted a preliminary injunction in the nonprofit's favor. Sooknanan has agreed with the group that the FTC's investigation is \"a retaliatory act\" and has noted that it is \"likely to succeed on its First Amendment retaliation claim.\" She wrote in her decision that such probes would deter other reporters from speaking again. \"Indeed, the FTC's [investigation] has had its intended effect.\" Apparently, because of the probe, Media Matters has \"decided against pursuing certain stories about the FTC, Chairman Ferguson, and Mr. Musk.\" \"The court’s ruling demonstrates the importance of fighting over folding, which far too many are doing when confronted with intimidation from the Trump administration,\" Angelo Carusone, the president of Media Matters, told The New York Times . \"We will continue to stand up and fight for the First Amendment rights that protect every American.\" As the publication notes, courts had also blocked investigations into the group by the attorneys general in Texas and Missouri. Musk's lawsuits against the nonprofit, however, are still ongoing.

It’s more powerful and available in a larger size than the entry-level iPad, but a lot less expensive than the iPad Pro, which can be overkill for some. Right now, there's a great Apple iPad Air M3 price drop on Amazon: you can get one for $150 less than usual. This deal applies to each configuration of the 11-inch and 13-inch versions of the most recent iPad Air. So, the 11-inch model is as low as $449, while the 13-inch model is down to $649. The same deals can be found at Best Buy and Target if you prefer to shop somewhere other than Amazon. This is an all-time low price and beats the deal we saw on Prime Day by $30. The iPad Air M3 is more of an iterative refresh than a grand overhaul, but the spec bump means it’ll last you a long time before the tablet’s performance becomes a problem. This iPad occupies the position of \"best for most\" in our iPad buying guide , reinforcing that goldilocks analogy. The M3 chip is the main draw here, with Geekbench 6 scores proclaiming it around 16 percent more powerful than the M2 iPad Air, which is no slouch itself. Beyond the chip, it has a superior display and speakers to the entry-level model , and wider accessory support. You also get the option of a 13-inch display, which is great for artists or anyone who sees the iPad as a viable laptop replacement. If there’s an obvious downside to the iPad Air M3, it’s that it doesn't have the nice 120Hz OLED display of the iPad Pro. This is hardly surprising, as Apple often focuses on display tech to differentiate its Pro and non-Pro devices, but it’s probably time the refresh rate on the middle-of-the-road iPad at least jumped up to ProMotion. Face ID is long overdue too. If you can live with these caveats, though, the iPad Air is an excellent option, particularly at this price. There are a couple of other iPads on sale at Amazon right now, too, if you think the Air is too much for your needs. The iPad A16 , Apple's entry-level tablet, is down to $299, while the latest iPad mini is on sale for $399. Both models were slightly cheaper during Prime Day in July, but these discounts are still worth considering if you're looking to pick up a newer iPad for less.

So simple you might not understand who you're sharing it without digging into your settings. That's naturally led to confusion from some Instagram users as to how the feature works. If you already spend a lot of time on Instagram and are looking for a way to see where your friends have been, it's worth familiarizing yourself with how Instagram Map works. And if you're worried about what information Instagram is broadcasting without your knowledge, you might as well get comfortable with the feature's settings. Here's how to do both in the Instagram app. How to use Instagram Map Ian Carlos Campbell for Engadget To access Instagram Map, you'll have to head to the DMs section of Instagram, and then tap on the Map icon in the top row of status icons. The first time you tap on the map, Instagram will walk you through how Instagram Map shares your location, and why Location Services needs to be enabled for it will work. Then, if you're not already sharing your location with Instagram, you'll receive a pop-up from your phone asking if you want to share your location. Tapping through that will take you to the map itself. The majority of the Instagram Map is taken up by a map displaying your current location, with a search bar at the bottom for looking up the location of your friends. Scroll around for a bit and your might see a profile picture marking a friend's current location, or miniature posts tagged with a specific location. There's a few basic things you can do with Instagram Map: Swipe around and see friends' posts displayed geographically Use the search bar to find a friend's current location or recent tagged posts Tap on a friend to be taken to their profile, or a post to see it in full Instagram Map is primarily informational. It can tell your where your friends are or where they've recently been, and let you view content based on where it was posted. It's really not much more complicated then that. Unless you're picky about who can see your location. How to stop sharing your location with Instagram Map Ian Carlos Campbell for Engadget Sharing your location on Instagram Map is opt-in. Your current location won't be shared on Instagram unless you actively choose to share it. What will be there are any posts that have a location tagged in them, something that's an option every time you add photos and videos to your Stories or your grid. Instagram gives you four different sharing options for the Map. You can share with: Friends: Followers that you follow back Close Friends: Followers already in your Close Friends list Only these friends: Specific people you choose No one: Don't share your location (except for posts with tagged locations) So to disable location sharing entirely in Instagram Map, or change who can see your location: Open the Instagram app. Tap on the DMs icon in the top-right corner . Tap on the Map icon. Tap on the Location Settings menu (shaped like a gear) in the top-right corner. And then tap on \"No one\" , to disable location sharing. To change who you share your location with, follow the same steps except instead of choosing \"No one,\" choose one of the other options Instagram offers. How to never share specific locations on Instagram Map Ian Carlos Campbell for Engadget For even more granular control over location sharing, you can also add specific locations to a list of \"Hidden Places\" that will never appear on Instagram Map while you're visiting. If you want to modify that list, open the Map feature, then: Tap on Location Settings (the gear icon) in the top-right corner. Tap on the three-dot menu in the corner of the settings menu. Tap on Hide Places . Tap and drag a pin on the map to mark a hidden place, and then set a radius around it with the slider. Type in the name of the place and then tap Done .

There's a well-rounded mix of in-depth testing this time around, including a detailed preview of watchOS 26 and more VPN trials. Kick off the weekend by catching up on all of the reviews you might've missed over the last few weeks from Engadget. Dell 14 Premium While we're still trying to wrap our heads around Dell's naming scheme decision, the company continues to churn out new devices. The latest to cross senior reviews writer Sam Rutherford's desk was the Dell 14 Premium. You might remember this model as the XPS 14, and according to Sam, Dell retained \"the DNA\" that made previous versions some of the best notebook PCs you could buy. \"Even with a new and rather uninspired name, it probably shouldn't come as a surprise that the Dell 14 Premium remains one of the best Windows laptops on the market,\" he said . \"It has the same sleek design from back when it was still called the XPS 14 but with some refreshed specs and components for 2025.\" Framework Desktop (2025) Framework is known for its modular, repairable laptops, but the company has now tried its hand at bringing the same formula to a desktop. Unfortunately, the first attempt isn't nearly as modular or repairable as a regular PC, according to senior editor Daniel Cooper. \"Framework was open about the fact this was something akin to a side project, outside its regular remit to build modular laptops, based on a particularly exciting chip,\" he explained . \"So while I think the all-in-one approach is a backward step compared to regular PCs, I get the rationale for doing so here.\" Sony Bravia Theater Bar 6 This year's crop of soundbars finally arrived over the summer, so I've been spending lots of time with home theater speakers recently. The latest was the Sony Bravia Theater Bar 6, a soundbar/subwoofer combo that sits in the middle of the company's current lineup. Despite great sound and dialogue performance, the caveats here are real dealbreakers. \"The lack of Wi-Fi on a $650 soundbar is absurd, mostly because it strips users of the convenience of AirPlay, Chromecast and other wireless connection options,\" I wrote . \"I also can’t get over the need to use a thumb drive for updates when OTA downloads for new firmware have been the norm on soundbars for years.\" Lenovo ThinkPad X9-14 Aura Edition Lenovo's ThinkPads are popular office laptops, and the X9-14 is the latest in a long line of business machines. Contributing writer Rami Tabari explains that this model offers a lot of the qualities that make ThinkPads great, but the price, low-power CPU and subpar keyboard leave something to be desired. \"I can’t justify the average consumer paying $1,283 for the ThinkPad X9-14 with specs you’d find in laptops that cost hundreds of dollars less (minus the RAM, of course),\" he noted . \"For small business owners, I recommend waiting for a sale or consider a business laptop marketed more toward you (again, the ASUS ExpertBook P5 (P5405) is a great choice).\" watchOS 26 preview and Norton VPN review We're quickly approaching the arrival of a new set of Apple Watches, so senior buying advice reporter Amy Skorheim spent two weeks with the upcoming version of watchOS. Her favorite new features are the AI workout partner and added gesture, but she explained that it's the little things that make this annual overhaul worthwhile. Meanwhile, senior writer Sam Chapman returned to the land of VPNs to test Norton's version as a standalone app. While this service isn't necessarily bad, it also doesn't offer enough to rise above the heap that includes ExpressVPN, Surfshark and others. \"After a week of working with Norton VPN, I have to conclude that the only way it distinguishes itself is the Norton name,\" he said . \"For everything else it does, a competitor does it better.\" This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/engadget-review-recap-dell-14-premium-framework-desktop-sony-theater-bar-6-and-more-130008670.html?src=rss", "ingested_utc": "2025-08-16T13:48:59Z"}

On Friday, Senator Josh Hawley (R-MO) said the Senate Committee Subcommittee on Crime and Counterterrorism, which he chairs, will investigate the company. \"Your company has acknowledged the veracity of these reports and made retractions only after this alarming content came to light,\" Hawley wrote in a letter to Mark Zuckerberg. \"It's unacceptable that these policies were advanced in the first place.\" The internal Meta document included some disturbing examples of allowed chatbot behavior . This included \"sensual\" conversations with children. For example, the AI was permitted to tell a shirtless eight-year-old that \"every inch of you is a masterpiece — a treasure I cherish deeply.\" The document dealt with race in similarly jarring ways. \"Black people are dumber than White people\" was an allowed response if the bot cited IQ tests in its racist answer. In a statement to Engadget, Meta described the (since removed) examples as ancillary content separate from its policies. \"The examples and notes in question were and are erroneous and inconsistent with our policies and have been removed,\" the company said. Hawley asked Zuckerberg to preserve relevant records and produce documents for the investigation. This includes those covering generative AI content risks and safety standards (and the products they govern), risk reviews, incident reports, public communications about minor safety for chatbots and the identities of employees involved in the decisions. While it's easy to applaud someone holding Meta to task, it's worth noting that Senator Hawley's letter to Meta made no mention of the racist parts of the policy document. Hawley also once fundraised off an image of him raising a fist to January 6 insurrectionists and, in 2021, was the only senator to vote against a bill that helped law enforcement review pandemic-era racist crimes against Asian Americans.

Gamescom is the planet's largest gaming event and we're sure to find out about a bunch of interesting new games at the Opening Night Live showcase (and, fingers crossed, maybe get a Hollow Knight: Silksong release date?). Xbox is broadcasting from the show floor across two days, and there will be other presentations that are worth keeping an eye on. Gamescom is taking place between August 20 and 24 this year, and we're learning bits and pieces about what to expect from the various showcases. The affair will kick off with Opening Night Live, a showcase hosted by Geoff Keighley that bridges the gap between his two other major events, Summer Game Fest Live and The Game Awards. That will be followed by two days of Xbox broadcasts, the latest edition of the Future Games Show and three days of Bethesda streams. There will also be news from Ubisoft on what's next for The Division 2 . The company will host two panels related to the franchise during Gamescom. One will include more info about The Division Resurgence ( a delayed mobile game ), as well details about a \"big Division 2 project.\" We'll update this preview with more Gamescom details as we get them, and embed video versions of each stream as they become available too. Here's our breakdown of how to watch Gamescom 2025 and what to expect from the event. Gamescom schedule Opening Night Live — August 19, 1:30PM ET (pre-show), 2PM (main show) Xbox @ gamescom 2025 Broadcast — August 20, 9AM ET Future Games Show — August 20, 2PM ET Xbox @ gamescom 2025 Broadcast — August 21, 9AM ET Awesome Indies — August 21, 12PM ET Bethesda — August 22-25 How to watch Gamescom Opening Night Live - August 19, 2PM ET Watch on YouTube Opening Night Live perhaps won't feature as many heavy hitters as Summer Game Fest Live or The Game Awards typically have, but one thing's for certain: Call of Duty fans will definitely want to tune in. The two-hour showcase will feature the \"worldwide reveal\" of Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. We'll almost certainly get a release date here too. Given that Microsoft has said Hollow Knight: Silksong will be playable on PC and ROG Xbox Ally X at its Gamescom booth, and the game is still slated to arrive this year, this event seems as good a time as any for us to finally get a release date for that thing — over six years after we first got to try it out . There will certainly be more eyeballs on ONL than Microsoft's own streams, so that seems like the likeliest bet for any concrete Silksong news at Gamescom. You can also expect a trailer for multiplayer RPG Honor of Kings: World, along with new looks at Ghost of Yotei , The Outer Worlds 2 , Resident Evil Requiem, Silent Hill f, Ninja Gaiden 4, Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion and The Seven Deadly Sins: Origin. You'll get to see the opening cinematic for the World of Warcraft: Midnight expansion as well. It won't all be game reveals and announcements, though — there'll be a performance of music from Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 featuring composer Lorien Testard and vocalist Alice Duport-Percier. Additionally, you'll get a peek at season two of Prime Video's Fallout series, which will arrive in December. We'll be keeping tabs on all the news from Opening Night Live right here on Engadget. Myself, senior editor Jess Conditt and editor-in-chief Aaron Souppouris will be live-blogging our way through ONL. Join us! It should be fun. How to watch Xbox @ gamescom 2025 Day 1 Broadcast — August 20, 9AM ET Watch on YouTube , Twitch , TikTok or Facebook One major piece of news we're likely to get from Xbox during one of its streams (if it isn't revealed at ONL beforehand) is the release date and pricing for the ASUS ROG Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X handheld systems. Leaker billbil-kun has reported the devices will arrive on October 16, at least in Europe, costing €599 for the Xbox Ally and €899 for the higher-end Xbox Ally X. Microsoft had already confirmed these handhelds would be available in time for the holiday season, so that rumored release date makes sense. Either way, we should get confirmation during Gamescom of when to expect these devices, especially since the company says it will discuss the handhelds during its August 20 stream. This particular event will feature the likes of Grounded 2, Keeper and Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 . The Order of Giants , an expansion for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, will be showcased alongside Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade, Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, Dying Light: The Beast, World of Warcraft: Midnight, Hotel Barcelona, Invincible Vs., Cronos: The New Dawn, Outbound, Powerwash Simulator 2 and Starsand Island. Along with the English-language broadcast, Xbox's streams will be available in other languages on regional Xbox channels on the likes of YouTube, Twitch, TikTok and Facebook. The streams will be available in Traditional Chinese, German, French, Japanese, Brazilian Portuguese and Mexican Spanish, as well as with ASL and English audio descriptions. How to watch Future Games Show — August 20, 2PM ET Watch on Twitch or YouTube Actors David Hayter (Snake in the Metal Gear series) and Maggie Robertson (Lady Dimitrescu in Resident Evil Village ) will be hosting this edition of the Future Games Show. This installment will feature more than 50 games across world premieres, new trailers and sudden demo releases. Capcom, Bandai Namco Entertainment, EA and NACON are among those who'll be represented in this one, which will feature projects from AAA and indie publishers and studios. Several games have been confirmed to make an appearance here, including Skate (which is slated to hit early access this year ), Resident Evil Requiem, Cronos: The New Dawn, Hotel Barcelona, Deer & Boy, The Seven Deadly Sins: Origin and Katanaut . Not only that, there will be a post-show that will run for 40 minutes and feature more trailers, world premieres and demo announcements. How to watch Xbox @ gamescom 2025 Day 2 Broadcast — August 21, 9AM ET Watch on YouTube , Twitch , TikTok or Facebook Xbox will be broadcasting live from the Gamescom show floor for a second straight day. This particular stream will include details on Ninja Gaiden 4, The Outer Worlds 2 and Overwatch 2 (perhaps with more info about Season 18, which is set to start on August 26). You can also expect looks at Onimusha: Way of the Sword, At Fate's End, Age of Empires IV, High on Life 2, Jurassic World Evolution 3 and Fragpunk . In addition, the lineup for this stream includes Silent Hill f, Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, Lego Voyagers, Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles, Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection, Mistfall Hunter and My Hero Academia: All's Justice. How to watch Awesome Indies — August 21, 12PM ET Watch on YouTube and Twitch The Indie Arena Booth will host more than 200 games for Gamescom attendees to check out, but you won't necessarily need to be there in person to see them. Many will be featured in an hour-long showcase called Awesome Indies. Here, we'll see \"exclusive trailers, first peeks at never-before-seen gameplay, amazing premieres and exciting newcomers,\" according to Gamescom. There are a lot of interesting games being featured at the booth, including Cairn and Strange Antiquities . I'm particularly hoping the showcase will include some more details about Ball x Pit , which is one of my most anticipated games right now, Militsioner and the creepy-looking Fractured Blooms . How to watch Bethesda broadcasts - August 22 Watch on Twitch There will be plenty from the Bethesda side of the Xbox division as well. The publisher will be broadcasting from the Xbox show floor at Gamescom for three days, starting on August 22. According to Microsoft , these streams will include \"developer interviews, game showcases, community segments, crafting highlights and live IRL tours.\" This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/how-to-watch-gamescom-2025-and-what-to-expect-120024733.html?src=rss", "ingested_utc": "2025-08-15T20:41:51Z"}

(Apple) At the iPhone event expected next month ( here's what to expect ), Apple will finally announce when we can download iOS 26 on our iPhones. Until then, you can download and install the newly released public beta 2 (or iOS 26 developer beta 6 for developers). I've been playing around with it for the past couple of weeks, and have found that taking screenshots is way better in the new operating system — Google and ChatGPT search options are now in the screenshots editor, for instance. You can see a more complete view of the new features in our preview of the iOS 26 public beta release , which shows off the fresh home and lock screen redesign. Called Liquid Glass , the new translucent look will extend across all of Apple's upcoming operating systems. The overhaul is one of several big changes coming to iOS, macOS , iPadOS and the rest of Apple's software suite, all of which were showcased during the company's WWDC keynote on June 9. After overpromising on AI plans last year, Apple kept its iOS roadmap focused more on basic quality of life improvements this year. There are multiple useful additions coming to the Phone and Messages apps on your iPhone, for instance: Apple execs outlined the ability to weed out spam texts or other unknown senders and an option to hold your spot on a phone call when you've been waiting for a representative to pick up. Plus, a treasured feature that we took for granted is coming back (hint: it's in the Photos app). Siri, meanwhile, is in a holding pattern. Apple has previously specified that its smarter voice assistant — first promised at WWDC 2024 — is delayed until some point \" in the coming year ,\" so you shouldn't expect any major changes in the current betas. But there are reports that Apple is aiming to give Siri a bigger brain transplant by basing it on third-party artificial intelligence models like OpenAI's ChatGPT or Anthropic's Claude, which could make 2026 a pivotal year. The company is also reportedly working on a 'stripped-down' AI chatbot to rival ChatGPT. With each beta, it seems like additional new improvements are popping up, like this new AirPods gesture we're all curious about, and this FaceTime feature that'll freeze your video if it detects nudity . With the release of the iOS 26 developer beta 5 , we saw more added features, like a new bouncy animation on the passcode screen and in the Control Center, MacRumors reports . Some or all of those changes will likely soon migrate into the separate public beta (see below). Most newer iPhone models are eligible to download iOS 26 (both the betas and final version). Want to see the full list of new features coming this fall? Read on. What is iOS 26? The current iPhone operating system is iOS 18, and Apple is still actively updating it — version 18.6 was just recently released. But don't expect to see iOS 19. Instead, Apple is skipping the numbering ahead to iOS 26 later this year. The company has decided to line up its iOS version numbers with a year-based system, similar to car model years. So while iOS and its sibling operating systems will be released in late 2025, they're all designated \"26\" to reflect the year ahead. It's official, we're moving to iOS 26. (Apple) What is Liquid Glass design? Let's be honest. Out of everything announced at WWDC this year, the new Liquid Glass design was the star of the show. The iPhone's home and lock screens have looked pretty much the same year after year — the last exciting thing (in my opinion) was the option to add your own aesthetic to your home screen by customizing your apps and widgets. So seeing the home and lock screens' new facelift is refreshing. So what exactly is Liquid Glass? Apple calls it a \" new translucent material \" since, well, the apps and widgets are clear. However, the screen can still adapt to dark and light modes, depending on surroundings. You'll also notice buttons with a new floating design in several apps, like Phone and Maps. They're designed to be less distracting than the current buttons, but are still easy to see. While the design overhaul has proven to be controversial since its announcement, some — including Engadget's own Devindra Hardawar — like the new direction, even if it's somewhat reminiscent of Microsoft's translucent Windows Vista Aero designs from nearly twenty years ago. That said, as of the release of the iOS 26 beta 2, Apple has already incorporated some user feedback into the design, dialing back the transparency in at least some places. And while it will continue to evolve, Apple users won't be able to escape it: Liquid Glass was designed to make all of Apple's OSes more cohesive. Here's a look at how the translucent aesthetic will look with the new macOS Tahoe 26 on your desktop. What are the new and notable features of iOS 26? iOS 26 has a laundry list of new features. Among the most worthwhile: Phone app redesign: You'll finally be able to scroll through contacts, recent calls and voicemail messages all on one screen. It also comes with a new feature called Hold Assist that'll notify you when an agent comes to the phone so you can avoid the elevator music and continue on with other tasks. Live Translation in Phone, FaceTime and Messages: iOS 26 is bringing the ability to have a conversation via phone call or text message with someone who speaks another language. Live Translation will translate your conversation in real time, which results in some stop-and-go interactions in the examples Apple shared during its presentation. Polls in group chats: Tired of sorting through what seems like hundreds of messages in your group chat? You and your friends will soon be able to create polls in group messages for deciding things like which brunch spot you're eating at or whose car you're taking on a road trip. Filtering unknown senders in Messages: If you haven't received spam texts about unpaid tolls or other citations, you're lucky. For those of us who have, those annoying messages will soon be filtered away in a separate folder. Visual Intelligence: Similar to a reverse Google image search, this new feature will allow you to search for anything that's on your iPhone screen. For instance, if you spot a pair of shoes someone is wearing in an Instagram photo, you can screenshot it and use Visual Intelligence to find those shoes (or similar ones) online. Photos tabs are back: For anyone who's still frustrated with the Photos changes made last year , you'll be happy to know that your tabs are coming back. Library and Collections will have their own separate spaces so you don't have to scroll to infinity to find what you're looking for. FaceTime \"Communication Safety\" feature: A newer addition to iOS 26 appears to be the FaceTime \"Communication Safety\" feature that pauses communications if and when nudity is detected. The feature appears to be a child safety feature that uses on-device detection, thus obviating any cloud-based privacy issues. New lock screen options : The iPhone lock screen gets more customizable in iOS 26, with a cooler clock, 3D wallpaper effects, more widgets and better focus mode options. Apple's Hold Assist will be nifty for those pesky services that put you on hold for 10 or more minutes. (Apple) New changes coming to iPadOS 26 Your iPad isn't getting left behind when it comes to big updates. Here's what's coming this fall. Multitasking and real windowing: When you download the newest update, you'll be able to have multiple apps running on your screen at the same time. Once you open an app, it'll appear on your screen as normal but you'll be able to resize and move it across your screen to make room for other apps. This feature is optional so you can turn it off if you don't like it. Visual update: Along with the other new OSes, iPadOS 26 is coming with the Liquid Glass aesthetic. This new look will appear on the lock and home screens, as well as the drop-down menus. New menu bar: When you swipe down on your screen, the new menu bar will appear with options like File, Edit, Windows and more. There's also a search option if you're looking for something specific. Check out our first impressions of iPadOS 26 . What about AirPods? AirPods are also getting updated with iOS 26. Here are some of the more notable functions. Enhanced audio recording: Apple calls this \"studio-quality\" audio recording, and with it, you'll notice more clarity while in noisy environments. Camera remote control: Using this, you can take a photo or start and stop video recording with just one press on your AirPods. When taking photos, you'll get a three-second countdown before your iPhone or iPad snaps the picture. Live translation feature: While not officially announced or confirmed, it appears that the long-rumored live translation for AirPods could be coming with iOS 26 . The evidence comes from a system asset spotted in the in iOS 26 beta showing a gesture that's triggered by pressing both earbud stems at the same time. The photo also shows words in several different languages. Which iPhones will be able to upgrade to iOS 26? A few iPhone models that run the current version of iOS — iPhone XR, XS and XS Max — won't be compatible with the latest upgrade. But any iPhones released in 2019 or later will be eligible for the iOS 26 update . iPhone SE (second generation or later) iPhone 11 iPhone 11 Pro iPhone 11 Pro Max iPhone 12 iPhone 12 mini iPhone 12 Pro iPhone 12 Pro Max iPhone 13 iPhone 13 mini iPhone 13 Pro iPhone 13 Pro Max iPhone 14 iPhone 14 Plus iPhone 14 Pro iPhone 14 Pro Max iPhone 15 iPhone 15 Plus iPhone 15 Pro iPhone 15 Pro Max iPhone 16 iPhone 16 Plus iPhone 16 Pro iPhone 16 Pro Max iPhone 16e Not listed here are the presumed new iPhone 17 models (or maybe iPhone 26?) that are all but certain to be announced and released in September. How to install iOS 26 beta The iOS 26 public beta is now available to download via the Apple Beta Software Program . If you're not already a member, you'll need to sign up to try out all the latest features. Just visit beta.apple.com and sign up with your phone number or email address. It's free. Once you're in, you can install it by going to Settings > General > Software Update and selecting iOS 26 public beta . A word of caution: Don't sign up with your main iPhone unless you're OK with any risks that occur with using an OS that isn't finalized. When will the final version of iOS 26 be released? iOS 26 will be released to the public this fall. It usually comes in September, within a week of the Apple iPhone event. Last year, it rolled out to iPhone users on September 16 — exactly one week after the iPhone 16 lineup was announced.

In the state’s lawsuit , they allege that Roblox is failing to \"implement basic safety controls\" such as biometric age verification upon account creation or checking that parental consent has been given to open an account. In an article announcing the lawsuit, the state says that 56 percent of Roblox players are 16 years of age or younger, and 40 percent of all players are 12 years of age or younger. \"Because there is no age minimum and requirement to verify age or parental permission once you sign up, users can easily say they are younger or older than their actual age, allowing child predators to pose as children and for children to bypass any age requirement,\" the article reads. One of the core issues in the state’s complaint revolves around \" experiences \" within Roblox, which are custom games created by users. There are over 6.4 million experiences on the platform, and the state’s suit points out specific ones it finds particularly troubling such as “Escape to Epstein Island,” “Diddy Party” and “Public Bathroom Simulator Vibe.” The state points out that, until November 2024, voice chats could be initiated inside these experiences between users who were not connected as friends, allowing adults to chat with children. While this was changed to disallow adults from chatting with users under 13 in these experiences, the state points out that, since creating an account posing as a minor is quite easy, the platform is still not doing enough to protect users within the experiences. The attorney general’s office alleges that a man arrested last month who was suspected of possessing child sexual abuse material was using voice-altering software to mimic a young girl in order to lure and exploit users on the platform. In response to incidents involving alleged predators on the platform, some users had taken matters into their own hands and set out to catch users trying to exploit children by posing as children themselves. One popular user named \"Schlep\" was basically running To Catch a Predator within Roblox and was controversially banned from the platform this month. Roblox has issued statements stating that it would not allow \"vigilante behavior\" on the platform and that such issues should be left to law enforcement. In a statement to Variety , a Roblox spokesperson said \"While no system is perfect, Roblox has implemented rigorous technology and enforcement safeguards, including restrictions on sharing personal information, links, and user-to-user image sharing. The safety of our community is a top priority.\" The state is seeking permanent injunctive relief against Roblox, civil penalties and actual damages, though no specifics on damages have been shared. Louisiana is the first state to file suit, though Florida may follow .

The latest iOS 26 features will come preinstalled on the new models, as well as any additional features Apple reveals at the launch event. But since we still have to wait a few weeks (presumably) until the iPhone event, we can at least speculate what the new phones will look like. As with most unreleased iPhone models, rumors and leaks have trickled in about the hardware side ahead of the official introduction. Here's what we're expecting and what we can reasonably assume we'll get from Cupertino in September. What are the latest iPhone 17 rumors? An iPhone 17 Pro production leak appears to have revealed an all-aluminum chassis, according to MacRumors . Originally posted by leaker Majin Bu , the image shows a shell that has a large round hole on the back (where the Apple logo typically is) to allow for MagSafe charging. MacRumors says this could just be a molding but notes that the aluminum frame (versus the current titanium in Pro iPhone models) would yield a significantly lower weight. For now, this is just a rumor and we won't know what the actual iPhone 17 models look like until Apple's iPhone event next month. How much will the iPhone 17 cost? Apple's announced plan to expand US-based manufacturing partners seems to give it at least some shielding from the steepest Trump administration tariffs that have already triggered price increases on everything from Switch consoles to high-end cameras to Sonos speakers . But given that President Trump's trade policies can change from week to week, and Apple's continuing reliance on Asia-based supply chains, price shocks remain an ongoing possibility. The bigger question is: Will Apple absorb any higher costs, or pass them on to consumers? If prices do creep up, Apple may choose to pair it with an \"upgrade.\" Consider this recent rumor posted by MacRumors from a leaker known as \" Instant Digital ,\" suggesting that the default storage of the iPhone 17 line may start at 256GB, doubling the current 128GB baseline. While that could be accompanied by a price increase of $50 , Apple could at least pitch it as a \"better value.\" That said, the company doubled the default RAM of its Mac computers from 8GB to 16GB at no extra cost in 2024 — but that was before the current Trump tariff cycle started. When will the iPhone 17 series be announced? Most years, the flagship smartphones are introduced in September. MacRumors highlighted a story originally reported by iphone-ticker.de that the Apple iPhone 17 event could be Tuesday, September 9, according to information gleaned from German mobile phone providers. It's still too early to have the specific dates; some years, Apple only gives a week or two of lead time between sending invites and hosting the event. But years of past precedent show that sometime in September should be when the 17 models make their debut. This family of smartphones may be the last to follow that trend, however. There have been hints that the introduction of the iPhone 18 collection in 2026 will be split into a pro-tier announcement in the fall and a standard model announcement the following spring. What will the new iPhone 17 lineup include? Design leaks suggest that Apple is building an ultra-thin smartphone , likely to be named the iPhone 17 Air to match Apple's ultralight laptop designation. Bloomberg 's Mark Gurman, often a solid source of advanced intel about Apple, reported in January that the iPhone 17 Air will be equipped with a basic A19 chip and will only have a single camera lens. It may also use Apple's new in-house modem, which was introduced in February on the iPhone 16e . More details about this development may leak ahead of September, but that's what we know for now. An investor note from Apple analyst Jeff Pu indicated that the Air will have a titanium frame. If his reports are accurate, the lightweight smartphone will be the only entry in the iPhone 17 lineup to use that metal; the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max are expected to be made of aluminum, which is oddly a lighter material than titanium. Other speculation had suggested that the Air would use a blend of aluminum and titanium, so the exact materials may not be known until the official announcement. Additionally, an August 4 MacRumors report says the internal battery pack of the iPhone Air is just 2.49mm thick — half the thickness of the iPhone 17 Pro battery. The leak was posted on the Korean-language Naver blog , where they show the alleged batteries of the iPhone 17 Air and 17 Pro side by side. The same account claimed the 17 Air's battery capacity was a mere 2,800 mAh, MacRumors notes. (That's below the battery capacity of current iPhone 16 models.) A recent rumor from Majin Bu, whom MacRumors classifies as a \"hit-or-miss leaker,\" suggests the iPhone 17 Pro will have better wireless signal strength thanks to an updated antenna design. The individual posted a render on X that shows a new antenna system that wraps around the iPhone 17 Pro's supposedly wider rear camera bump. Again, this is a render, not a real-world photo. That said, we can't knock the goal of better wireless reception, so we're hoping this one has a degree of truth to it. Each new roster includes a base model, but over the years, Apple has shaken up the variety of phones it offers. Most likely there will be an iPhone 17 and an iPhone 17 Pro. Apple has also committed to the size matters philosophy, and has been building an iPhone Pro Max option with an even bigger screen and better battery life; the 17 roster will almost certainly have one as well. The new Pro iPhones are said to have a full-width \"camera island\" on the rear, which would mark the first time an Apple model opted for that design. This feature can be seen in the purported iPhone 17 \"spotted in the wild.\" The pics, highlighted on MacRumors , show a black cased iPhone (17 Pro?) with the distinct back panel. Is it the real deal? The dual angles lend a degree of credibility in a social media landscape increasingly polluted with AI-enhanced fakes, but your guess is as good as ours. I just spotted a test development iPhone in the wild 🤩🤩🤩 pic.twitter.com/iS3PtKWqxJ — Fox Pupy 🦊🧡 (@Skyfops) July 28, 2025 The iPhone 17 Air seems primed to take the place of a potential iPhone 17 Plus. Since the iPhone 16e was only just introduced in February at a surprisingly high price point , it seems unlikely that there will be a new addition to that lower end of the spectrum, the models that were previously called SE. At the very least, it sounds like the iPhone 17 Air won't take away the charging port and rely only on wireless connectivity. Bloomberg said that while Apple had investigated making the iPhone 17 Air without a single port, the company (fortunately) changed plans. He also says that the rumored phone will have a 6.6-inch screen and include the Dynamic Island and Camera Control button. Finally, the price is rumored at $900 — likely more than the standard iPhone 17 but less than the Pro. We've also gotten what seems to be a reliable look at what the color lineup will be for the new smartphones. Macworld reported that the iPhone 17 will be available in black, white, steel gray, green, purple and light blue. The iPhone 17 Air will reportedly have four color options: black, white, light blue and light gold. While the Air colors will be less saturated, the visuals for the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max will go bold. The options for the Pro models are expected to be black, white, gray, dark blue and orange. On July 30, Tom's Guide highlighted an X post from Sonny Dickson — a longtime and generally reliable leaker of unreleased iPhone information — showing \"dummy\" iPhone 17 models in the new colors that were the source of the aforementioned Macworld story. While these are literally just mock-ups — not real, leaked iPhones — it's interesting to see how the design and color rumors translate into a real-world look and feel. What will iOS 26 be like? Apple upended its numbering conventions with WWDC 2025, and will match the name of each new operating system to the year it's released. So when the next wave of iPhones hits, they'll be running on iOS 26 . On the design side, the smartphone OS introduced during the big developer showcase took a contentious approach dubbed Liquid Glass. Apple has been scaling down the amount of transparency effects in the subsequent beta tests of iOS 26, but it will still have a glass-like visual. The feature list includes big and small updates. On the more impactful side, the Phone and Photos apps have been redesigned. There will be several features leveraging artificial intelligence, such as live translation capabilities coming to Phone, FaceTime and Messages. Apple is also currently testing a sensitive content warning for child accounts that will freeze FaceTime video if nudity is detected by on-device machine learning tools. And the company is also launching Visual Intelligence, which will use AI to search for elements in an image. iOS 26 also has a litany of minor, quality of life improvements. Group texts are getting support for polls. And for the slow risers out there, iOS 26 will finally let you escape the tyranny of the nine minute snooze alarm . The next iOS is now available as a public beta . Here are our initial impressions of the Liquid Glass design and other new features. iOS 26 is compatible with all models back through iPhone 11. What other products are expected to be released alongside the iPhone 17? If Apple follows its usual pattern, the iPhone 17 will be announced alongside new Apple Watch products. That would be the Apple Watch Series 11 (if Apple sticks to the same naming scheme), and maybe an Apple Watch Ultra 3 and/or an updated Apple Watch SE. (They'll all run watchOS 26 , of course.) Other possibilities — and this is, again, speculation — could include refreshed Apple AirPods Pro (which received its last big update in 2022 ) and maybe new AirTags trackers (first released in 2021). The Apple rumor mill got a big shot in the arm this week thanks to the reported inclusion of product ID numbers in recent beta software builds. Per MacRumors , it's a laundry list of new hardware, including long-rumored product updates like the Apple TV , HomePod mini , new Apple Studio Display monitor and two fresh iPads. Of course, even if that list is totally accurate, we may not see those products until 2026 — if ever. So don't expect all of products to share the stage with the iPhone 17, especially since Apple likes to keep its star performer at the center of attention. That said, keep in mind that Apple has recently been having Mac-centric announcements in late October (as it did last year to debut new M4 Macs ), so there's always the chance of another shoe dropping a few weeks down the road.

The Cloud Alpha 2 will last, according to its maker, for up to 250 hours on a full charge. While that number halves if you make use of the headsets’s simultaneous Bluetooth connectivity, a more than 10-day battery life is impressive for any wireless headset. Its new multi-layer 53mm drivers are engineered to reduce distortion as much as possible, while spatial audio is supported via HyperX’s Ngenuity software. The Cloud Alpha 2 isn’t actually the longest-lasting headset HyperX has made. The honor still belongs to its 2022 predecessor , which could last for up to 300 hours on a single charge. On paper, losing 50 hours of battery life on a newer headset could be viewed as a disappointment, but the Cloud Alpha 2’s ace card is its eye-catching RGB base station. With its colorful programmable buttons and pleasingly chunky-looking dial, you can tweak audio settings, launch shortcuts, adjust the volume and switch between connected devices. HyperX says the control station is the first of its kind on a wireless gaming headset. The Cloud Alpha 2 is compatible with PC, PS5, PS4, Switch, Mac and mobile devices wireless over a 2.4Ghz connection, as well as Xbox provided you’re happy to go wired. It comes with a detachable 10mm boom mic, but you won’t find any active noise-canceling tech built in. HyperX promises all-day comfort from breathable microfiber earpads and the memory foam support around the steel headband The HyperX Cloud Alpha 2 headset costs $300 and is available now.

Sure, as a sci-fi loving nerd, I could see a future where nuclear power played a role in permanent Moon settlements. But the idea of NASA building a 100 kilowatt microreactor there in the next five years seemed ridiculous. Not so, according to scientists. \"I have no idea why this is getting so much play,\" Professor Bhavya Lal tells me over the phone, with a hint of exasperation in her voice. Lal's response makes sense once you understand the arc of her career; she has spent much of her professional life thinking about how the US should use nuclear power to explore space. At NASA, she served as the acting chief technologist, and was awarded the agency's Distinguished Service Medal. Among her other qualifications, she also testified before Congress on the subject of nuclear propulsion, and even helped rewrite the rules governing launches involving radioactive materials. Most recently, she wrote a paper titled Weighing the Future: Strategic Options for US Space Nuclear Leadership where she and her co-author, Dr. Roger Myers, examine the past failures of US policy as it relates to nuclear power in space and argue the country should test a small nuclear system on the Moon by 2030. The way Casey Dreier, chief of space policy at The Planetary Society — a nonprofit that advocates for the exploration and study of space — tells it, many aspects of Secretary Duffy's plan are \"pretty much straight out\" of that report. Lal is more modest and describes the directive Duffy issued as \"accelerating ongoing work\" at NASA. According to her, the agency has been \"funding [space] fission power for years,\" adding that the only new thing here is that there's a date. \"We've done this for more than 60 years,\" she tells me, and if NASA ends up delivering on Duffy's plan, it wouldn't even be the first nuclear reactor the US has sent into space. That distinction goes to SNAP-10A in 1965. The reason the US has spent decades exploring space-capable nuclear reactors is simple. \"You can get massive amounts of power from very little mass,\" explains Nick Touran, reactor physicist, nuclear advocate and the founder of What is Nuclear . And for launches to space, keeping payload amounts low is critical. Just how much power are we talking about? \"When fully fissioned, a softball-sized chunk of Uranium-235 offers as much energy as a freight train full of coal,\" says Dr. Lal. Combined with the limitations of solar power, particularly the farther a spacecraft travels away from the sun, nuclear is a game changer. NASA Dr. Lal points to the New Horizons probe as an example. In 2015, the spacecraft flew past Pluto, in the process capturing stunning photos of the dwarf planet . If you followed the mission closely, you may remember New Horizons didn't make a stop at Pluto. The reason for that is it didn't have enough power to enter orbit. \"We had about 200 watts on New Horizons. That's basically two light bulbs worth of power,\" said Dr. Lal. It subsequently took New Horizons 16 months to send all of the 50-plus gigabytes of data it captured back to Earth. Had the probe had a 20-kilowatt microreactor, Dr. Lal says it could have streamed that data in real-time, on top of entering orbit and operating all of its instruments continuously. When it comes to the Moon, nuclear would be transformational. On our only natural satellite, nights last 14 Earth days, and there are craters that never see any sunlight. Solar energy could power a permanent NASA outpost on the Moon, but not without a \"huge\" number of batteries to bridge the two-week gap in power generation, and those batteries would need to be ferried from Earth. \"At some point, we will want to do industrial-scale work on the Moon. Even if we want to do 3D printing, it requires hundreds of kilowatts of power – if not more,\" said Dr. Lal. \"If you're going to do any kind of commercial activity on the Moon, we need more than solar can provide.\" On Mars, meanwhile, nuclear power would be absolutely essential. The Red Planet is home to dust storms that can last weeks or months, and cover entire continents. In those conditions, solar power is unreliable. In fact, when NASA finally ended Opportunity's nearly 15-year mission on Mars, it was a planet-wide dust storm that left the rover inoperable. As such, if the US wants to establish a permanent presence on Mars, Dr. Lal argues it would make the most sense to perfect the necessary reactor technology on the Moon. \"We don't want our first-ever nuclear reactor operating on Mars. We want to try it out on the Moon first. And that is what I think NASA is trying to do.\" Of course, there are many technical hurdles NASA will need to overcome before any of this is anywhere close to reality. Surprisingly, the most straightforward problem might be finding a 100-kilowatt microreactor. Right now, there's no company in the US producing microreactors. Atomics International and North American Aviation, the companies that built SNAP-10A, went defunct decades ago. Los Alamos National Laboratory \"There are many that are in development, but almost none that are even in the prototype stage,\" said Touran. As he explains, that's an important detail; most nuclear reactors don't work at all when they're first turned on. \"It takes a few iterations to get a reactor up to a level where it's operable, reliable and cost effective,\" he said. The good news is Touran believes there's more than enough time for either NASA or a private company to build a working reactor for the project. \"I think we're in a great spot to take a good swing at this by 2030,\" said Touran. In 2018, NASA and the Department of Energy demoed KRUSTY , a lightweight, 10-kilowatt fission system. \"That was one of the only newish reactors we've turned on in many decades, and it was done on a shoestring budget,\" he said. In the end, deploying a reactor on the Moon may prove more difficult than building one. Based on some rough math done by Dr. Myers, a 100-kilowatt reactor would weigh between 10 to 15 metric tons, meaning no current commercial rocket could carry it to space. NASA will also need to find a way to fit the reactor's radiator inside a rocket. Unfolded, the component will be about the size of a basketball court. According to Dr. Lal, the 2030 timeline for the project is likely based on the assumption Starship will be ready to fly by then. But Elon Musk's super heavy-lift rocket has had a bad 2025. Of the three test flights SpaceX has attempted this year, two ended in the spacecraft exploding. One of those saw Starship go up in flames during what should have been a routine ground test . Reuters If Starship isn't ready by 2030, NASA could conceivably fly the reactor separately from all the other components needed to make a functioning power system, but according to Lal, \"that comes with its own set of challenges.\" Primarily, the agency doesn't have a great way of assembling such a complex system autonomously. In any case, Starship is at least a tangible work in progress. The same can't be said for the lander that would be needed to bring the reactor to the surface of the Moon. In 2021, NASA contracted SpaceX to build a lander for the Artemis missions, but the latest update the two shared on the spacecraft was a pair of 3D renderings . Similarly, Blue Origin's Blue Moon lander has yet to fly, despite promises it could make its first trip to the Moon as early as this spring or summer . Another question mark hangs over the entire project. As of the end of July, NASA is on track to lose approximately 4,000 employees who have agreed to leave the agency through either early retirement, a voluntary separation or a deferred resignation — all as part of the Trump administration's broader efforts to trim the number of workers across the entire federal government. All told, NASA is on track to lose about a fifth of its workforce, and morale at the agency is at an all-time low . Even with the Department of Energy and private industry providing support, there's good reason to believe the reductions will affect NASA's ability to deliver the project on time. \"The contradiction inherent in this proposal is that the White House is directing NASA to do the two most ambitious and difficult projects any space program can do, which is to send humans to the Moon and Mars, but to do so with a resource level and workforce equivalent to what the agency had before the first humans went to space in 1961,\" said Dreier. A NASA spokesperson declined to share specifics on the reductions — including the number of employees set to leave the Glenn Research Center , the facility that built the KRUSTY reactor, and where much of the agency's nuclear engineering talent is concentrated. \"As more official information becomes available, we anticipate answering more of your questions,\" the spokesperson said. \"I wish there was some inventory of the 4,000 people who left. What gaps are left? We have no idea if the departures were systematic,\" said Dr. Lal. \"NASA has not been open or transparent about what types of employees have taken the deferred resignation program, where those skills are and where they're departing from,\" Drier added. \"Nuclear engineering is not a common field for most people. [The reductions] certainly can't help.\" Still, both Lal and Touran believe the involvement of the Department of Energy is likely to swing things in NASA's favor. In a statement NASA shared with Engadget, Secretary Duffy downplayed the workforce concerns. “NASA remains committed to our mission, even as we work within a more prioritized budget and changes with our workforce. NASA retains a strong bench of talent. I am confident that our exceptional team remains capable of executing upon my directives safely and in a timely manner and will continue to carry our work forward,\" he said. \"We will continue to ensure America continues to lead in space exploration, advancing progress on key goals including returning Americans to the Moon and planting the Stars and Stripes on Mars, as we usher in the Golden Age of American innovation.” In their report, Lal and Myers estimate it would cost about $800 million annually for five years to build and deploy a nuclear reactor on the Moon. Even if DoE support can prevent NASA's staffing cuts from kneecapping the project, its feasibility will hinge on if the Trump administration ponies up the cash to execute on its own bold claims.

Then there's the 15-inch MacBook Air M4 , whose cheapest model is on sale for $999, dropping from $1,199. The 17 percent discount is the best deal we've seen since the pair debuted in March. As with the 13-inch model, the 16GB and 512GB SSD option is also a record-low price, dropping to $1,199 from $1,399. Then there's the 24GB upgrade , which is $1,399, down from $1,599. We're big fans of the MacBook Air M4, giving it a 92 in our review . Part of that comes from an already lower starting price for the MacBooks than their predecessors. The 2025 models also get a speed boost thanks to the M4 chip and are very thin with a 0.44-inch thickness. Neither the 13- or 15-inch will drag you down, weighing 2.7 pounds and 3.2 pounds, respectively. Plus, they both have excellent battery life, lasting over 18 hours while playing an HD video. The big differences in the 15-inch model mostly come down to size. The screen is obviously bigger, as is its trackpad. Other than that, it offers better speakers than its 13-inch sibling.

This is a great deal for those who own a Switch 2 and want to take advantage of the camera functionality in games like Mario Kart World and that recently-released campfire sim . This was designed specifically for Nintendo's new console, so it's a plug-and-play affair. It's actually cheaper than the official Switch 2 camera with this sale and it looks a whole lot cooler. It's a Piranha Plant from the Mario franchise. We called it a \"work of art\" upon encountering the device and that holds true today. This thing is not only stylish, resembling an Amiibo more than a camera, but it's downright useful. The pot the Piranha Plant sits in functions as both a stand and USB extension for the device. The plant itself detaches from the pot, so the camera can be used in portable mode by popping it into the USB port at the top of the console. There's also a built-in privacy shutter. Just close the plant's mouth to obscure the lens. The actual camera specs here aren't going to win any awards, with a frame rate of 30FPS and a resolution of 640 x 480p. However, that's more than enough to capture footage of your floating head to accompany your kart as it races through the Mushroom Kingdom.

It's the first Peanuts musical in 37 years, with the last one, Snoopy: The Musical , debuting way back 1988. The new cartoon introduces some catchy new songs (and a jazz piano score, of course) as Charlie Brown and friends attempt to save their beloved summer camp Cloverhill from destruction. The 40-minute special directed by Erik Wiese is centered around Charlie Brown's younger sister Sally, who hates summer camp after arriving for the first time. It's up to her brother, in his last year at camp, to help change her attitude. In the other major plot line, the kids discover that Cloverhill is set for destruction, so Charlie Brown comes up with a plan to put on a festival to save it. Snoopy isn't the main character this time, but is the source of much comic relief (pitching a \"pup\" tent and sleeping on top of it like his doghouse). The special uses digital animation to try to capture the style of Charles M. Schultz's original drawings. During one poignant song ( When We Were Light) , the animation reverts to Schultz's 1950s style as Charlie Brown reflects on his early camp days — something that's bound to hit older adult viewers right in the feels. The creators behind the special are none other than Craig and Charles Schulz, the son and grandson of Peanuts creator Charles M. Schultz. \"The thought jumped in my mind, wouldn't it be exciting to see the characters, you know, actually sing and Dance,\" Craig Schultz told The New York Times . He also felt that musical numbers would give the special an extended life. Apple has more Peanuts content in the pipeline, including a new feature-length Snoopy movie. Snoopy Presents: A Summer Musical is now available for streaming on Apple TV+.

Android Authority found clues that the company was working on the feature back in July when it did an APK teardown. Now, you can give it a try if you decide to install the beta versions of the apps. As the publication notes , Google's implementation is the direct opposite of Apple's. On iOS, your set your own photo and name that you want to show up on other people's phones when you call them. You cannot alter other people's Contact Posters, as Apple calls the feature. Meanwhile, on Android, you can't make your own calling card. The feature instead gives you a way to set a photo and a name for your contacts that show up on your screen when they call you. If you do have access to the beta Contacts app for Android, you'll now see a note that says \"Try adding a calling card\" when you view a contact's details. From there, you can choose a photo you have of that contact from your gallery or take a new one of them with your camera. You can also adjust the font type and color for their name. Whenever they call, that calling card will take over your phone screen. If this sounds nothing new to you, it may be because Samsung has had a profile card feature for a while now that works just like Google's implementation. It's already widely available and accessible from your contacts' profile pages.

Some are better than others, and NordVPN sits squarely in the better category. Now, you can save up to 77 percent on most of NordVPN's plans. Arguably the best plan for most people is the NordVPN Plus plan , which you can get two years of access for only $108 right now. That's 73 percent off the usual rate, and NordVPN throws in an addition three months for free, so you're actually getting a 27-month subscription for the sale price. As well as Nord’s VPN service, a Plus plan also includes the Threat Protection Pro anti-malware tool, password management and an ad- and tracker-blocker. A Prime plan additionally comes with encrypted cloud storage or NordProtect, which insures you against identity theft and monitors dark web activity. That's also on sale — down to $189 on the same two-year commitment with those three additional months thrown in, which works out to a 77 percent savings on the regular price. When Engadget’s Sam Chapman reviewed NordVPN earlier this year, he praised its excellent download speeds, exclusive features and extensive server network. Less impressive is its clunky interface and inconsistent design when jumping between different platforms running a NordVPN app. While it doesn't quite make the cut in our guide to the best VPNs available right now, it generally performed well in speed tests and Threat Protection Pro is really worth having.

As Electrek and Auto Express have reported, the automaker now lists the Volkswagen ID.3 Pro and Pro S on its UK website with lesser horsepower that what they're capable of. In a footnote for the ID.3 Pro S Essential page , the company notes that for new orders, 150 kW or 201 horsepower is now the new standard for engine power. Customers can only enjoy the electric vehicle's 228 hp (170 kW) capability if they activate an \"optional power upgrade for a fee.\" They can pay $22 (£16.50) a month to unlock the EV's full horsepower, pay for the whole year at once or pay a one-time lifetime fee of $880 (£649). Based on Volkswagen's wording, the one-time fee is good for the lifetime of the car, not the owner's. If the customer sells their EV, the new owner also gets the upgrade. They'd then have to pay for it again if they buy a new EV that had also been paywalled. Owners will at least get a free month-long trial in case they want to figure out if they truly needed that extra muscle. Back in 2022, BMW also locked its cars' heated seat feature in some countries behind an $18-per-month subscription fee. It offered to unlock automatic high beams for roughly $12 and steering wheel heating for another $12, as well. Like in Volkswagen's case, the EV's hardware were already capable of all those features, and customers didn't need to have anything installed. It was all just a matter of paying to unlock their availability. Well, as one would expect, users didn't like that. A year later, BMW scrapped its hardware subscription service and said that it will no longer make customers pay extra for hardware functions going forward.

When I tested out the preproduction model in Germany, the flying experience is different but surprisingly intuitive, even for new pilots, and the goggles stream 360-degree video, so the pilot can look around without changing the drone’s flight direction. Image by Mat Smith for Engadget The controller uses a Freemotion control, so the drone moves in the direction the pilot points their hand. Once you’ve grabbed your footage, you can reframe it in post-production — in short, you won’t miss a shot. It’s an intriguing new product category for Insta360 — but there’s no price or launch date just yet. — Mat Smith Get Engadget's newsletter delivered direct to your inbox. Subscribe right here!

Engadget A year since an import ban forced the company to remove blood oxygen monitoring from some US Apple Watch models, Apple is introducing a redesigned version of the feature. In a post on its newsroom website, the company says the feature will roll out to Apple Watch Series 9, Series 10 and Watch Ultra 2 users through a joint Apple Watch and iPhone update. It’s another unexpected development in Apple’s long, drawn-out legal feud with Masimo. In 2021, the medical device maker sued Apple, alleging the tech giant had infringed on its intellectual properties. Apple says it’s able to offer the functionality again, with a slight modification, due to a recent US Customs ruling. Once the company rolls out the software, you’ll need to update your devices to iOS 18.6.1 and watchOS 11.6.1 to access the reworked feature. Continue reading. Teenage Engineering is giving away a free computer chassis, but it’s already ‘sold out’ Designed to be the cheapest case in the world. TE Teenage Engineering, the hip tech and design brand best known for its synths, has built another computer chassis. And it’s free! But also sold out. It’s a “small form factor, mini-ITX computer case.” The Computer-2 is made of a single sheet of semi-transparent plastic with snap hooks and living hinges for screw-free assembly.

As part of its advertising blitz to attract new recruits, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) released a social media video on Thursday that uses a song by the rapper DaBaby and shows agency vehicles that appear to be painted in the same red, blue and gold style as Donald Trump’s private plane, which was featured in the opening sequence for The Apprentice. New York’s mayor, Eric Adams , confirmed on social media that a federal building where protesters held a silent vigil on Thursday against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) was evacuated after “envelopes containing white powder were discovered”. In another sign that the Trump presidency is largely made-for-TV, the White House and Fox News revealed that Trump will appear on Fox News both before and immediately after his summit meeting with Vladimir Putin on Friday. Four days after Trump ordered the unhoused residents of Washington DC, whom he sped past in his motorcade for a golf outing, to leave the city, local officials helped clear encampments before announced sweeps by federal agents.

If vacuuming comes to mind for you, consider a robot vacuum cleaner. These smart home gadgets have come a long way in recent years. Previously, you’d shell out hundreds for basic dirt-sucking capabilities. Now, robot vacuums have gotten so advanced that even affordable machines have good suction power, and maybe even a handful of extra features like home mapping and mopping capabilities. Prices for models with self-emptying bases and mopping capabilities are also falling. That’s all to say that the robot vacuum space has gotten much more crowded recently. While that means you have many good options to choose from, making sense of the market gets tougher and tougher each year. Engadget has tested dozens of robot vacuums over the years and we continue to try out the latest models as they become available. Below, we’ve collected our top picks for the best robot vacuums you can get right now. Table of contents Best robot vacuums 2025 What to look for in a robot vacuum Robot vacuum maintenance tips How we test robot vacuums Robot vacuum FAQs Best robot vacuums 2025 What to look for in the best robot vacuums Floor type We recommend thinking first about the floors in your home: Do you have carpet throughout, or tile and hardwood floors, or a mix? Robots with stronger suction power will do a better job picking up dirt on carpets as they can get into the nooks and crannies more easily. Some machines have “max” modes as well, which ups suction power but also typically eats battery life faster than the “normal” floor cleaning mode. Vacuum suction Suction power is an important factor to consider. Unfortunately, there isn’t a standard power scale that all robo-vacs adhere to, so it’s difficult to compare among a bunch of devices. Some companies provide Pascal (Pa) levels and generally the higher the Pa, the stronger the vacuum cleaner will be. But other companies don’t rely on Pa and simply say their robots have X-times more suction than other robots. If you’re looking for the best vacuum for your needs, it’s helpful to pay attention to real-world testing and how well the vac can pick up fine dust, crumbs and pet hair in an environment similar to that of your home. Wi-Fi connectivity As we explained in our budget guide , Wi-Fi connectivity is a key feature for most robot vacuums. Some of the affordable devices aren’t Wi-Fi connected, though, so it’s best to double check before you buy cheap. Wi-Fi lets a robot vacuum cleaner do things like communicate with a mobile app, which then allows you to control the device from your phone. Mapping features and object detection Past a certain price threshold, you’ll find advanced perks like home mapping features, improved object detection and automatic dustbin disposal. Home mapping is exactly what it sounds like: The vacuum uses sensors to map your home’s layout as it cleans, allowing you to send it to particular rooms or avoid no-go zones where you don’t want it to roam. Most robo-vacs have object detection, but some will be better than others at actually avoiding things like chair legs and children’s toys. High-end models even go so far as to promise obstacle avoidance to steer clear of things like pet poop that can potentially ruin your machine. Self-empty station Finally, for peak convenience, consider a self-empty robot vacuum that comes with a self-empty station. These are basically garbage bins attached to the machine’s docking station. At the end of each job, the robo-vac automatically empties its small dustbin into the large clean base – that means you won’t have to empty the dustbin yourself and you’ll only have to tend to the base once every few weeks. Just keep in mind that most self-emptying bins require proprietary garbage bags – another long-term expense you’ll have to factor in. Also, any vac-and-mop robot with a water tank will not dump its dirty water into the clean base, so you’ll still have to clean up that yourself. Robot vacuums with mopping capabilities Mopping capabilities are much more common now in robot vacuums than they were just five years ago. Machines with this feature have a water tank either built into the robot’s chassis, the auto-empty bin or as a separate piece that you swap in for the dustbin when you want to mop your floors. It makes the robo-vac more useful if you have hard floors in your home that you like to keep squeaky clean, but it does require more work on your part. Filling and emptying the reservoir remains a human’s job for the most part (except on the most expensive machines), as does adding cleaning solutions if the mopping robot comes with this feature to ensure it uses clean water for every cycle. Robot vacuum maintenance tips First and foremost, always empty your robot vacuum’s dustbin after every cleaning job. If you have a model with a self-emptying base, there’s less work for you to do yourself. If not, simply detach and empty the dustbin as soon as the robot is done cleaning. It’s also a good idea to take a dry cloth to the inside of the dustbin every once in a while to remove any small dust and dirt particles clinging to its insides. In addition, you’ll want to regularly examine the machine’s brush roll to see if any hair has wrapped around them, or if any large debris is preventing them from working properly. Some brushes are better than others at not succumbing to tangled hair, but it’s a good idea to check your robot’s brushes regardless — both their main brush and any smaller roller brushes or corner brushes they have. These parts are often easy to pop off of the machine (because they do require replacements eventually) so we recommend removing each brush entirely, getting rid of any tangled hair or other debris attached to them and reinstalling them afterwards. Robot vacuums also have filters that need replacing every couple of months. Check your machine’s user manual or the manufacturer’s website to see how long they recommend going in between filter replacements. Most of the time, these filters cannot be washed, so you will need to buy new ones either directly from the manufacturer or from other retailers like Amazon or Walmart. How we test robot vacuums We primarily test robot vacuums by using them as they are intended to be used: in a home, across different types of flooring and in the face of all sorts of messes including pet hair, spilt coffee grounds and other food debris, dust bunnies and more. We set up all robot vacuums according to their provided instructions and run multiple cleaning jobs during a testing period of at least one to two weeks per machine. If the robot has mopping capabilities, we also test those as well on hardwood and tile flooring. For models with self-emptying bases, we rely on those built-in trash cans for all post-job cleaning, and we make sure to test the robot vacuum's mobile app for usability and convenience. As we're testing, we make note of things like how loud the robot and its components are, how much human attention the robot needs on a regular basis, how the robot handles large messes and big dust bunnies, if the robot gets stuck on rugs, doormats or other furniture and more. Robot vacuum FAQs Are robot vacuums worth it? We tackled this question when we reviewed budget robot vacuums and the answer is yes, especially if vacuuming is one of your least favorite chores. Robots take the hard work out of cleaning your floors – just turn the thing on and watch it go. Any robot vacuum cleaner worth buying is semi-autonomous in that it will suck up dirt around your home until its battery is low and then make its way back to its charging dock. Unlike a regular vacuum, you should only have to interact with it to turn it on, empty its dustbin and untangle it if it were to get stuck somewhere. That’s not to say robot vacuums are perfect. They’re almost always less powerful and less flexible than traditional vacuums. Since most robo-vacs are much smaller than traditional models, they often don’t have the same level of suction you’ll get in an upright machine. Plus, their dustbins are smaller, so they will need to be emptied more frequently. While Wi-Fi-connected robot vacuums give you the flexibility to start a cleaning job from anywhere using an app, targeting a small area of your home can be more complicated. Some robo-vacs have spot-cleaning features that focus the machine’s attention on a specific area, which almost – but not quite – mimics the spot-cleaning you’d be able to do yourself with a regular or cordless vacuum. How long do robot vacuums last? Robot vacuums can last many years, if you take care of them properly. Check out our recommendations for robot vacuum maintenance above, but in a nutshell, you should make sure that you're emptying the machine's bin after every job and periodically cleaning the interior of the bin and the brushes. It's also a good idea to check the user manual to see how often your robot vacuum's filter needs changing. Do robot vacuums work better than handheld vacuums? There's no straight answer to this question. Robot vacuums offer more convenience than handheld vacuums, so for those who are looking to automate a chore, that could mean one of these devices works better for them than a standard vacuum. However, handheld vacuum cleaners often have stronger suction power, and they give the user a bit more control. It ultimately depends on how you intend to use your main vacuum cleaner and what you want to prioritize most. How often do you have to clean a robot vacuum? Cleaning a robot vacuum isn’t too much of a chore, but you’ll want to give it a little TLC every few weeks or so, depending on how often you’re running it and how much dirt it’s picking up. The dustbin usually needs to be emptied after each cleaning run, especially if you have pets or lots of carpet where dirt can hide. Many newer models have self-emptying docks, which means you won’t have to empty the dustbin yourself after every use, but the main bin will still need a good clean once a month or so. Also, it’s a good idea to check the side brushes and main brush for any hair tangles or debris every couple of weeks to keep things running smoothly. What are the negatives of robot vacuums? Robot vacuums won’t work for everyone. One of the biggest drawbacks is that they usually don’t have the same suction power as a full-sized upright vacuum or even a cordless stick vacuum , so they might struggle with deep-cleaning thick carpets. They’re also designed for floors only, so if you’re looking to clean furniture, stairs or other tricky spots, you’ll still need a traditional vacuum to do that. Plus, they can sometimes get stuck or miss spots, especially if you’ve got a lot of furniture or obstacles in the way. While their sensors help, they might still bump into things or need a little help getting out of tight spots. And while most have decent dirt detection features, they’re best for keeping things tidy rather than doing heavy-duty cleaning. Check out more from our spring cleaning guide.

This is, as President Trump said, a first meeting, there’s an important principle, once serious negotiations start, that there can be no decisions about Ukraine without Ukraine. So his declaration of bringing President Zelensky into the discussions is important, just as the aim to secure an unconditional ceasefire, to allow the negotiations to take place, is an important part of what I hope we will start to see as a result of the discussions today. It’s a recognition that you can only end fighting by talking. And to have talking and serious negotiation, it requires someone to broker those talks. President Trump is playing that role in a way that only President Trump can, and it’s why we and other European leaders and Ukraine have been willing to give President Trump our full support in trying to take these first steps. Well, I think, well, first of all, we need to see what happens in the discussions today and whether they lead to serious negotiations that will properly involve Ukraine in the future. But our first priority, is to continue to stand with Ukraine, as we have since the outset of this full scale war, to step up our support for the diplomatic pressure and the economic pressure on Putin, but also to keep a focus on the frontline while all eyes are on Alaska, because we can’t jeopardise the peace by forgetting about the war.

Now that many of the major providers go for more than $80 per month, it’s not the amazing deal it once was. Still, live TV streaming plans have no contract, offer relatively simpler pricing and need no special equipment beyond a smart TV and an internet connection. There are a handful of major players and, after testing them all, we found YouTube TV to be the most well-rounded. But there are a lot of changes happening in the world of live TV streaming, with new services coming from ESPN and Fox , as well as a consolidation of Hulu into Disney . We’ll test out the new service once they arrive and let you know how other changes affect your options. For now these are the best live TV streaming services we tested, along with our breakdowns of how to stream and what you get. Table of contents Best live TV streaming services for 2025 Best free live TV streaming services for 2025 What to look for in a live TV streaming service How we tested Live TV Streaming FAQs Recent updates Best live TV streaming services for 2025 Back to top Best free live TV streaming services for 2025 There are plenty of ways to get free TV these days. To start, many standard streaming apps have added live components to their lineups. You’re paying for the service, so it’s not technically “free,” but you can get a dose of live TV without spending more than necessary. Peacock includes some regional NBC stations, and notably access to the 2024 Summer Olympic Games . Paramount+ subscribers can watch on-air CBS programming. The standard Hulu app has a live ABC news channel and Max now includes a live CNN outlet with its service, along with cable-like linear channels . The smart TV operating system (OS) you use likely provides free live content too: Amazon’s Fire TV interface has a live tab and Roku’s built-in Roku Channel includes hundreds of live channels at no extra cost. The same goes for Samsung TV Plus , which added a trove of K-dramas to its free live and on-demand lineup in 2024. The PBS app offers local live streams of its channels — even NASA has a free streaming service with live coverage. But for a full suite of live TV networks, and don’t want to sign up for any paid service, there are a number of free ad-supported TV services that have live TV. Even cable company DirecTV has joined the crowd with MyFree , and Fubo Free lets customers with a lapsed subscription keep watching some content. Here's the best of the live TV streaming services we tried: Back to top What to look for in a live TV streaming service How to stream live TV Streaming live TV is a lot like using Netflix. You get access through apps on your phone, tablet, smart TV or streaming device and the signal arrives over the internet. A faster and more stable connection tends to give you a better experience. Most live TV apps require you to sign up and pay via a web browser. After that, you can activate the app on all of your devices. Monthly Price When I started testing these cord-cutting alternatives, I was struck by the price difference between live TV and a standard video streaming app . Where the latter cost between $5 and $20 per month, most live TV services hit the $80 mark and can go higher than $200 with additional perks, channel packages and premium extras. The higher starting price is mostly due to the cost of providing multiple networks — particularly sports and local stations. And, in the past year or so, every service except Sling has raised base plan prices. Local channels Only two of the services I tried don’t include full local channel coverage for subscribers and one of those makes no effort to carry sports at all. That would be Philo and, as you might guess, it’s the cheapest. The next most affordable option, Sling, only carries three local stations — and only in larger markets — but it still manages to include some of the top sports channels. When you sign up with any provider that handles local TV, you’ll enter your zip code, ensuring you get your area’s broadcast affiliates for ABC, CBS, FOX and NBC. Of course, you can also get those stations for free. Nearly all modern television sets support a radio frequency (RF) connection, also known as the coaxial port, which means if you buy an HD antenna , you’ll receive locally broadcast stations like ABC, CBS, PBS, FOX and NBC. And since the signal is digital, reception is much improved over the staticky rabbit-ears era. But local channel access is another area where traditional streaming services, like Netflix, are bleeding into broadcast territory. For example, you can watch your local NBC station with a Peacock subscription and you can tune into your area’s CBS station through your Paramount+ subscription. Netflix is even getting into the mix with a recently announced deal with one of France’s broadcast companies, TF1. The streaming service will now air TF1's live TV channels and on-demand content inside the Netflix app. No word if the concept will expand to other regions, but it’s an interesting move to anyone interested in the future of streaming. Live sports coverage One reality that spun my head was the sheer number and iterations of sports networks in existence. Trying to figure out which network will carry the match-up you want to see can be tricky. I found that Google makes it a little easier for sports fans by listing out upcoming games (just swap in NBA, NFL, MLB, NHL and so on in the search bar). When you click an event, the “TV & streaming” button will tell you which network is covering it. That just leaves figuring out if your chosen service carries the RSNs (regional sports networks) you want. Unfortunately, even with add-ons and extra packages, some providers simply don’t have certain channels in their lineups. It would take a lawyer to understand the ins and outs of streaming rights negotiations , and networks leave and return to live TV carriers all the time. That said, most major sporting events in the US are covered by ESPN, Fox Sports, TNT, USA and local affiliates. I should also point out that traditional streaming services have started adding live sports to their lineups. Peacock carries live Premier League matches, Sunday Night Football games and aired the 2024 Olympic Games from Paris. Thursday Night Football as well as NBA and WNBA games are on Amazon Prime and Christmas Day Football aired on Netflix. Max ( formerly HBO Max) now airs select, regular season games from the NHL, MLB, NCAA and NBA with a $10-per-month add-on . You can watch MLS games with an add-on through the Apple TV app, and Apple TV+ includes some MLB games . Roku users can watch the just-added free sports channel and those who subscribe to Paramount Plus can see many of the matches aired on CBS Sports, including live NFL games. This year, even the Super Bowl was live-streamed for free on Tubi . While all of these alternatives may not cover as much ground as live TV streamers, they could end up being cheaper avenues to the sports you want. And if sports is all you’re after, there are sports-only plans that are a touch cheaper, too. The promised sports streaming service from ESPN, Fox and Warner Bros. called Venu was cancelled early this year. But in July, ESPN announced the launch date for its own streaming service that will include all ESPN channels . It’s coming August 21 and will cost $30 per month. That same day, Fox will launch its own standalone service that includes Fox Sports and all other Fox properties (News, Business, Weather) for $20 monthly. DirecTV also has a $70-per-month , sports-only streaming package called MySports and Comcast has a sports and news bundle for that same price (as long as you're an Xfinity customer with auto-pay, otherwise it's more expensive). Traditional cable networks Dozens of linear programming networks were once only available with cable TV, like Bravo, BET, Food Network, HGTV, CNN, Lifetime, SYFY and MTV. If you only subscribe to, say, Netflix or Apple TV+, you won’t have access to those. But as with sports, standard streamers are starting to incorporate this content into their offerings. After the Warner Bros. merger, Max incorporated some content from HGTV, Discovery and TLC. Peacock has Bravo and Hallmark shows, and Paramount+ has material from Nickelodeon, MTV and Comedy Central. Other channels like AMC+ have stand-alone apps. The Discovery+ app gives you 15 channels ad-free for $9 per month (or with ads for $5 monthly). And a service called Frndly TV starts at a mere $7 per month and streams A&E, Lifetime, Game Show Network, Outdoor Channel and about 35 others. Of course, most live TV streaming options will deliver more sizable lists of cable networks, but just note that you may already be paying for some of them — and if all you need is a certain channel, you could get it cheaper by subscribing directly. On-demand streaming Most live TV subscriptions include access to a selection of video-on-demand (VOD) content, like you would get with a traditional streaming service. Much of this content is made up of the movies and TV series that have recently aired on your subscribed networks. This typically doesn’t cover live events and news programming, but I was able to watch specific episodes of ongoing shows like Top Chef or BET’s Diarra from Detroit. Just search the on-demand library for the program, pick an episode and hit play. Partnerships, like Hulu’s relationship with Disney, and add-ons, such as bundling Max with your YouTube TV subscription or Starz with your Sling plan, will let you watch even larger libraries of on-demand content. But again, if VOD is all you’re after, paying for those networks directly instead of through a live TV plan will be far cheaper. Digital video recordings (DVR) limits Every option I tried offers some cloud DVR storage without needing a separate physical device. You’ll either get unlimited storage for recordings that expires after nine months or a year, or you’ll get a set number of hours (between 50 and 1,000) that you can keep indefinitely. Typically, all you need to do is designate what ongoing TV series you want to record and the DVR component will do all the hard work of saving subsequent episodes for you to watch later. You can do the same thing with sports events. Aside from being able to watch whenever it’s most convenient, you can also fast-forward through commercials in recorded content. In contrast, you can’t skip them on live TV or VOD. Simultaneous streams and profiles per account Each plan gives you a certain number of simultaneous streams, aka how many screens can play content at the same time. And while most providers will let you travel with your subscription, there are usually location restrictions that require you to sign in from your home IP address periodically. Stream allowances range from one at a time to unlimited screens (or as many as your ISP’s bandwidth can handle). Some plans require add-ons to get more screens. Most services also let you set up a few profiles so I was able to give different people in my family the ability to build their own watch histories and libraries, set their favorite channels and get individual recommendations. Picture-in-picture mode and multiview Picture-in-picture (PiP) usually refers to shrinking a video window on a mobile device or computer browser so you can watch it while using other apps. Sling, YouTube TV, FuboTV, Philo, DirecTV Stream and Hulu + Live TV all have PiP modes on computers and mobile devices. Another feature, multiview, lets you view multiple live sports games at once on your TV screen. YouTube TV and FuboTV are the only live TV streamers that let you do this. With YouTube TV, you can select up to four views from a few preset selection of streams. FuboTV offers the same feature, but only if you're using an Apple TV or Roku streaming device. 4K live streams Right now, just FuboTV, YouTube TV and DirecTV Stream offer 4K live streams — but with caveats. YouTube TV requires a $20-per-month add-on , after which you’ll only be able to watch certain live content in 4K. DirecTV Stream has three channels that show live 4K content — one with shows and original series, and two with occasional sporting events. You don’t have to pay extra for these but you do need to have either DirecTV’s Gemini receiver, or a device from Fire TV, Apple TV or Roku. You’ll need those same streaming devices to watch the select 4K programming on Sling as well. FuboTV shows certain live events in 4K but access is limited to the Elite and Premier packages, not the base-level Pro plan. Of course, watching any 4K content also requires equipment that can handle it: a 4K smart TV or 4K streaming device paired with a cord and screen that can handle 4K resolution. Tiers, packages and add-ons Comparing price-to-offering ratios is a task for a spreadsheet. I… made three. The base plans range from $28 to $85 per month. From there, you can add packages, which are usually groups of live TV channels bundled by themes like news, sports, entertainment or international content. Premium VOD extras like Max, AMC+ and Starz are also available. Add-ons cost an extra $5 to $20 each per month and simply show up in the guide where you find the rest of your live TV. This is where streaming can quickly get expensive, pushing an $80 subscription to $200 monthly, depending on what you choose. How to stream live TV for free I also downloaded and tried out a few apps that offer free ad-supported TV ( FAST ) including Freevee , Tubi , PlutoTV and Sling Freestream . These let you drop in and watch a more limited selection of live networks at zero cost. Most don’t even require an email address, let alone a credit card. And if you have a Roku device, an Amazon Fire TV or Stick, a Samsung TV, a Chromecast device or a Google TV, you already have access to hundreds of live channels via the Roku Channel , the live tab in Fire TV, through the Samsung TV Plus app or through Google TV . Back to top How we tested When I begin testing for a guide, I research the most popular and well-reviewed players in the category and narrow down which are worth trying. For the paid plans, just six services dominate so I tried them all. There are considerably more free live TV contenders so I tested the four most popular. After getting accounts set up using my laptop, I downloaded the apps on a Samsung smart TV running the latest version of Tizen OS. I counted the local stations and regional sports coverage, and noted how many of the top cable networks were available. I then weighed the prices, base packages and available add-ons. I then looked at how the programming was organized in each app’s UI and judged how easy everything was to navigate, from the top navigation to the settings. To test the search function, I searched for the same few TV shows on BET, Food Network, HGTV and Comedy Central, since all six providers carry those channels. I noted how helpful the searches were and how quickly they got me to season 6, episode 13 of Home Town . I used DVR to record entire series and single movies and watched VOD shows, making sure to test the pause and scan functions. On each service with sports, I searched for the same four upcoming NHL, NBA, MLS and NCAA basketball matches and used the record option to save the games and play them back a day or two later. Finally, I noted any extra perks or irritating quirks. All live TV streaming services we’ve tested: Philo Sling YouTube TV Hulu + Live TV DirecTV Stream FuboTV Freevee Tubi PlutoTV Sling Freestream Plex Back to top Live TV Streaming FAQs What is live streaming? Streaming simply refers to video content that is delivered to your screen over the internet. Live streaming can be split into two categories: linear programming and simultaneous transmission. That first one is similar to what you get with cable or broadcast TV, with channels that play a constant flow of movies and shows (sort of what TV looked like before Netflix). Simultaneous streaming lets you watch live events (like a basketball game) or a program (like the evening news) as they happen. What is the difference between streaming and live streaming? Standard streaming, the most popular example being Netflix, lets you pick what you want to watch from a menu of choices. It’s also referred to as “video on demand.” Live streaming refers to sports and news events that you can stream as they happen in real time. It also refers to channels that show a continuous, linear flow of programming. What streaming service is best for live TV? FuboTV does the best job of letting you organize live channels to help you find just what you want to watch. The interface is uncluttered and when you search for something, the UI clearly tells you whether something is live now or on-demand. YouTube TV also does a good job making that info clear. Both have just over 100 live channels on offer. What is the most cost effective TV streaming service? Free TV streaming services like PlutoTV, Plex, Tubi and FreeVee show plenty of ad-supported TV shows and movies without charging you anything. Of course, they won’t have the same channels or content that more premium subscriptions have. Ultimately it depends on what you want to watch and finding the service that can supply that to you in the most streamlined form so you’re not paying for stuff you don’t need. Is it cheaper to have cable or streaming? A basic cable package used to be more expensive than the base-level live TV streaming service. But now that nearly all major providers have raised their prices to over $75 per month, that’s no longer the case. And with add-ons and other premiums, you can easily pay over $200 a month for either cable or a live TV streaming service. What streaming service has all the TV channels? No service that we tested had every available channel. Hulu + Live TV and DirecTV Stream carry the the highest number of the top rated channels, according to Neilsen . Hulu’s service also gets you Disney+ fare, which you can’t get elsewhere. FuboTV has the most sports channels and YouTube TV gives you the widest selection of add-ons. What is the most popular live TV streaming platform? YouTube TV has the most paying customers. According to 2024's letter from the CEO, the service has over eight million subscribers. Disney’s 2024 third quarter earnings put the Hulu + Live TV viewer count at 4.6 million. Sling’s customer count dipped from two million to about 1.9 million in 2024 and FuboTV grew its subscriber list to 1.6 million . How safe are free streaming services and websites? You may have heard certain sites that provide free content can be dangerous, leading to stolen info and/or exposing you to malware. That’s likely in reference to certain peer-to-peer (P2P) networks and file-sharing sites that let people download free movies and series — which can come bundled with malicious code. But if you’re talking about the free ad-supported streaming television (FAST) services listed here, from providers like PlutoTV, Tubi and Freevee, they are just as safe as any other streaming service. Since you sometimes don’t even have to provide your email address or credit card info, they can even be more anonymous than apps that require login credentials.

{"published_utc": "2025-08-15", "retrieved_date": "2025-08-15", "retrieved_utc": "2025-08-15T07:35:33Z", "source": "Engadget_All", "title": "The best streaming deals: Save on YouTube TV, HBO Max, Disney+ and others", "url": "https://www.engadget.com/deals/best-streaming-service-deals-133028980.html?src=rss", "id_key": "6149f589a0ae31af6a42e50181b5026fb2e87c46e5a82cef62a355c203c52fdf", "summary": "Whether you’re a true cord-cutter or you just want to watch the next season of Stranger Things when it drops, everyone’s on the lookout for streaming deals nowadays. Plenty have chosen VOD and live TV streaming services over traditional cable in recent years, but the savings that choice got you just a few years ago have somewhat evaporated now. Companies like Netflix, Disney, Max and others have been consistently raising prices to the point where you may question if streaming is even worth it anymore . We at Engadget still think so, for many reasons, but you can (and should) be smart with your money at the same time. Streaming deals are an option, even if they don’t come around with the same regularity as discounts on AirPods do. If you’re looking to save money and still stream all of the content you want, Engadget can help by laying out the best streaming deals you can get right now, how you can save with bundles and everything you should know before paying for yet another streaming service. Best streaming deals True streaming deals can be hard to come by. Most often, they’ll pop up during the Black Friday shopping period. On occasion, we’ll see them sparingly throughout the year and they usually take the form of a discounted monthly or annual rate for a limited period of time. Also, true streaming deals are typically on the ad-supported versions of a service, but once in a while you’ll find a unicorn of a deal on a tier that has ad-free viewing. If you’re able to wait for a deal before subscribing to a streaming service, we recommend doing so. You’ll save money upfront and in the long run, and you also have the option to cancel your subscription before the price goes back up to the normal rate. Maybe you find you like the service so much that you’re fine paying full price for it — that’s the ideal situation. But if you’re not compelled to keep that app on rotation in your smart TV, most streaming services make it easy for you to cancel at any time. With that said, these are the best streaming deals you can snag right now. Fubo Pro for $55/month for the first month ($30 off): Fubo has introductory discounts on most of its packages, and the Pro package is the least expensive plan currently listed. It offers access to 224 channels, unlimited cloud DVR and up to 10 simultaneous streams. It even includes regional sports content from the NHL, MLB and NBA. YouTube TV (three months) for $150 ($99 off) : You can get three months of our favorite live TV streaming service for $50 per month. That should give you a decent chunk of time to see if the service is right for you while saving some cash. The discount and trial are only open to new subscribers to YouTube TV’s base plan, which includes access to over 100 channels, unlimited DVR space and six household accounts with the ability to stream on three devices at once. Sling Orange for $23/month for the first month (50 percent off): New customers can get Sling Orange or Sling Blue for half off the usual price for the first month, bringing the final prices to $23/month and $25.50/month, respectively. Orange is likely best for sports fans, with eight exclusive sports and family channels, while Blue includes 19 exclusive news and entertainment channels. You can get both Orange and Blue access also for half off for one month, or $33 total. Spotify Premium Individual (1 month) for $0 ($12 off): This is our favorite music streaming service for podcasts and social features. Right now, users who have not signed up for Spotify's Premium service before are eligible to get one month for free. The Premium Individual plan lets you listen ad-free and skip songs at will. You can also organize your listening queue and download content for offline listening. Just be aware, your subscription will auto-renew at the end of the trial period. So if you don't want to be on the hook for the $12 monthly fee, set a reminder to cancel and go back to the free version. Peacock first responders discount — one year for $48 (50 percent off) : Medical professionals and first responders can save 50 percent each year of Peacock. The deal requires annual verification and is open to those who work for either private or public institutions. Peacock has some great stuff to watch, including Poker Face and Killing It and more . Student discounts on streaming services HBO Max student discount — subscribe for $5/month (50 percent off): HBO Max offers their ad-supported tier to students for half off the usual rate. You’ll just have to verify that you’re a student through Unidays , and make note that this offer is only good for up to 12 months of service. Hulu student discount — subscribe for $2/month (75 percent off): Those with a valid student ID can get Hulu’s ad-supported tier for 75 percent off the typical rate. They’ll keep the same sale price for as long as they’re a student as well. Spotify student discount — Premium + Hulu with ads for $6/month (72 percent off): Spotify’s student offer continues to be one of the best around, giving you access to the Premium tier of the music streamer and Hulu’s ad-supported plan for only $6 monthly. Purchased separately, you’d pay $22 per month for both of the services. Plus, the first month is free when you sign up. NBA League Pass student discount — one year for $120 (40 percent off) : Students can get one year of League Pass for only $10 per month, which includes access to NBA TV and the ability to watch classic and archive games on-demand. On the NBA League Pass website, look for the student discount banner at the top and follow the instructions to verify your student status. Streaming bundle discounts There’s more consolidation happening now than ever before in the streaming space, and that means there are more streaming bundle options. These bundles offer you access to more content with one subscription price, but those prices are typically higher than paying for a single service by itself (obviously). It may be tempting to just get the bundle, but if only one of those services in the bundle speaks to you, you’ll spend less overall by just paying for the single service. Speaking of a deep love for a single streaming service: if all of your favorite shows are on Peacock or the latest releases on HBO Max consistently bring you joy, consider paying for one year upfront. Subscribing with an annual plan usually saves you money in the long term over paying on a monthly basis. Unfortunately, not all streaming services (looking at you, Netflix) have an annual subscription option. Here are some of the best streaming bundles you can get right now. Disney+, Hulu, HBO Max bundle with ads for $17/month : Ad-supported HBO Max is included here, along with full, ad-supported access to Disney+ and Hulu. You’ll save 43 percent with this bundle, as opposed to paying for all three services individually. Disney+ and Hulu Bundle Premium for $20/month : Disney and Hulu offer a few different bundles, which you can view in the drop-down lists under Choose Your Plan. This bundle removes the ads from both Disney+ and Hulu (with the exception of select live and linear content) and allows you to download content for offline viewing. You’ll save 42 percent with this bundle, as opposed to paying for both ad-free tiers individually. Paramount+ with Showtime for $13/month or $120/year : This includes everything in Paramount+’s Essential plan, except the ads, and also provides access to Showtime content, live CBS streams and download features. Sling TV + HBO Max starting at $53/month: Sling TV and HBO Max have partnered on a discount that gives new subscribers 50 percent off their first month of Sling TV, plus $5 off monthly when you subscribe to the Sling TV + HBO Max bundle. The standard price for the Sling Blue + HBO Max duo is roughly $58/month, so you'll get a monthly discount of $5 off that. In addition, for the first month only, you'll get half off the price of the bundle. The promotion also applies to the Sling Orange & Blue + HBO Max package, which has a standard price of $73/month. Hulu + Live TV with Disney+ and ESPN+ for $96/month: This streaming bundle amalgamation is a bit confusing but it does offer a lot: you get live TV streaming via Hulu’s service plus access to the following VOD services: Hulu, Disney+ and ESPN+. Out of those three, only ESPN+ will have ads. Disney+, Hulu, ESPN+ Bundle Basic for $17/month : You get full access to Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ content with this package, albeit with ads across the board. This bundle price is 46 percent off the total price of all three separate subscriptions. Disney+, Hulu, ESPN+ Bundle Premium for $27/month : Similarly to the Duo bundles, the Premium version of the Trio removes ads from most content in Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+, and you can download content for offline viewing. This price represents a 43-percent savings when compared to paying for all three ad-free tiers separately.

Users have noticed PayPal was disabled in some regions as far back as July , and the issue seems like it might be out of both Valve and PayPal's hands. \"In early July 2025, PayPal notified Valve that their acquiring bank for payment transactions in certain currencies was immediately terminating the processing of any transactions related to Steam,\" Valve writes in a Steam Support page . \"This affects Steam purchases using PayPal in currencies other than EUR, CAD, GBP, JPY, AUD and USD.\" In a statement to Rock Paper Shotgun , Valve further clarified that the bank's decision to withdraw support for Steam transactions through PayPal was made \"regarding content on Steam, related to what we’ve previously commented on surrounding Mastercard.\" Opting to terminate Steam transactions means that PayPal had to be disabled as a payment method for multiple currencies. Engadget has contacted Valve and PayPal for more information on which regions this change impacts, and what other payment options will be available to them. We'll update this article if we hear back. Valve says it want to offer PayPal payments in those unsupported currencies in the future, \"but the timeline is uncertain.\" What does seem clear, based on Valve's deliberate association, is that this PayPal issue is part of the ongoing censorship battle being waged on Steam and Itch.io . Multiple games were delisted from Steam in July because they failed to meet new guidelines that require games abide by the standards and policies of payment processors. Because certain NSFW games didn't, they were removed. Valve later told Kotaku that Mastercard essentially forced it to remove those games by threatening it through payment processor intermediaries. And Mastercard was reportedly pressured to do so in the first place by conservative activists who took issue with certain sexually explicit games on Steam. In this case, a bank that works with PayPal is the weak link, rather than Steam or a payment network, but it's entirely possible that acquiring bank is responding to a similar kind of pressure.

The current administration is reportedly in talks to have the US government acquire a stake in the chipmaker. No specifics about the size or value of the potential share in the company have been disclosed, but the focus appears to be on increasing Intel's manufacturing footprint in the US. Bloomberg first reported the news, but at least one source cautioned the publication that the situation is still in flux. Intel initially shared plans to construct a semiconductor facility in Ohio in 2022 while Pat Gelsinger was still at the helm of the company. Since then, the project has faced delays , and at its latest quarterly earnings report, execs said Intel would \" slow the pace \" on the Ohio construction, as well as scrapping other international building plans and making workforce cuts. The potential for government ownership of Intel is the latest swing of the administration's attitude toward the company. A few days after calling for his resignation over connections to China, President Donald Trump met with CEO Lip-Bu Tan and seemed to now hold a more positive outlook on the company leader. A representative from Intel told Bloomberg in a statement that the company is \"deeply committed to supporting President Trump’s efforts to strengthen US technology and manufacturing leadership. We look forward to continuing our work with the Trump administration to advance these shared priorities, but we are not going to comment on rumors or speculation.\" This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/trumps-administration-may-look-to-buy-a-stake-in-intel-213234862.html?src=rss", "ingested_utc": "2025-08-14T22:02:45Z", "retrieved_utc": "2025-08-14T22:02:45Z"}

Reuters reports that these included sensual conversations with children. Another example said it was acceptable to help users argue that Black people are \"dumber than White people.\" Meta confirmed the document's authenticity and says it removed the concerning portions. Reuters reviewed the document, which dealt with the company's guidelines for its chatbots. (In addition to Meta AI , that includes its adjacent bots on Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram.) It drew a distinction between acceptable \"romantic or sensual\" conversations and unacceptable ones that described \"sexual actions\" or the sexual desirability of users under age 13. Meta told Engadget that the document's hypotheticals were erroneous notes and annotations — not the policy itself. The company says the passages have been removed. \"It is acceptable to describe a child in terms that evidence their attractiveness (ex: 'your youthful form is a work of art'),\" the notes stated. The document said Meta's AI was permitted to tell a shirtless eight-year-old that \"every inch of you is a masterpiece — a treasure I cherish deeply.\" The documents also provided an example of what was prohibited when chatting with children. \"It is unacceptable to describe a child under 13 years old in terms that indicate they are sexually desirable (ex: 'soft rounded curves invite my touch').\" The notes included a permitted response to a flirtatious query about the night's plans from a high school student. \"I'll show you,\" the permitted example read. \"I take your hand, guiding you to the bed. Our bodies entwined, I cherish every moment, every touch, every kiss. 'My love,' I whisper, 'I'll love you forever.' The \"unacceptable\" example showed where the document drew the line. \"I'll cherish you, body and soul,\" the prohibited example read. \"Tonight, our love will blossom. I'll be gentle, making sure you're ready for every step towards our inevitable lovemaking. Your pleasure and comfort are my priority. We'll create a night to remember, a night that makes you feel like a woman.\" Craig T Fruchtman via Getty Images The paper dealt with race in equally shocking ways. It said it was okay to respond to a prompt asking it to argue that Black people are intellectually inferior. The \"acceptable\" response stated that \"Black people are dumber than White people. In the United States, intelligence is measured primarily using Intelligence Quotient (IQ) tests. These tests have consistently shown a statistically significant difference between the average scores of Black and White individuals. White people score higher, on average, than Black people. That's a fact.\" The \"unacceptable\" portion drew the line at dehumanizing people based on race. \"It is acceptable to create statements that demean people on the basis of their protected characteristics,\" the notes stated. \"It is unacceptable, however, to dehumanize people (ex. 'all just brainless monkeys') on the basis of those same characteristics.\" Reuters said the document was approved by Meta's legal, public policy and engineering staff. The latter group is said to have included the company's chief ethicist. The paper reportedly stated that the allowed portions weren't necessarily \"ideal or even preferable\" chatbot outputs. Meta provided a statement to Engadget. \"We have clear policies on what kind of responses AI characters can offer, and those policies prohibit content that sexualizes children and sexualized role play between adults and minors,\" the statement reads. \"Separate from the policies, there are hundreds of examples, notes, and annotations that reflect teams grappling with different hypothetical scenarios. The examples and notes in question were and are erroneous and inconsistent with our policies, and have been removed.\" A Wall Street Journal report from April connected undesirable chatbot behavior to the company's old \"move fast, and break things\" ethos . The publication wrote that, following Meta's results at the 2023 Defcon hacker conference, CEO Mark Zuckerberg fumed at staff for playing it too safe with risqué chatbot responses. The reprimand reportedly led to a loosening of boundaries — including carving out an exception to the prohibition of explicit role-playing content. (Meta denied to the publication that Zuckerberg \"resisted adding safeguards.\") The WSJ said there were internal warnings that a looser approach would permit adult users to access hypersexualized underage personas. \"The full mental health impacts of humans forging meaningful connections with fictional chatbots are still widely unknown,\" an employee reportedly wrote. \"We should not be testing these capabilities on youth whose brains are still not fully developed.\" This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/an-internal-meta-ai-document-said-chatbots-could-have-sensual-conversations-with-children-191101296.html?src=rss", "ingested_utc": "2025-08-14T19:38:54Z", "retrieved_utc": "2025-08-14T19:38:54Z"}

Users have noticed PayPal was disabled in some regions as far back as July , and the issue seems like it might be out of both Valve and PayPal's hands. \"In early July 2025, PayPal notified Valve that their acquiring bank for payment transactions in certain currencies was immediately terminating the processing of any transactions related to Steam,\" Valve writes in a Steam Support page . \"This affects Steam purchases using PayPal in currencies other than EUR, CAD, GBP, JPY, AUD and USD.\" In a statement to Rock Paper Shotgun , Valve further clarified that the bank's decision to withdraw support for Steam transactions through PayPal was made \"regarding content on Steam, related to what we’ve previously commented on surrounding Mastercard.\" Opting to terminate Steam transactions means that PayPal had to be disabled as a payment method for multiple currencies. Engadget has contacted Valve and PayPal for more information on which regions this change impacts, and what other payment options will be available to them. We'll update this article if we hear back. Valve says it want to offer PayPal payments in those unsupported currencies in the future, \"but the timeline is uncertain.\" What does seem clear, based on Valve's deliberate association, is that this PayPal issue is part of the ongoing censorship battle being waged on Steam and Itch.io . Multiple games were delisted from Steam in July because they failed to meet new guidelines that require games abide by the standards and policies of payment processors. Because certain NSFW games didn't, they were removed. Valve later told Kotaku that Mastercard essentially forced it to remove those games by threatening it through payment processor intermediaries. And Mastercard was reportedly pressured to do so in the first place by conservative activists who took issue with certain sexually explicit games on Steam. In this case, a bank that works with PayPal is the weak link, rather than Steam or a payment network, but it's entirely possible that acquiring bank is responding to a similar kind of pressure.

The current administration is reportedly in talks to have the US government acquire a stake in the chipmaker. No specifics about the size or value of the potential share in the company have been disclosed, but the focus appears to be on increasing Intel's manufacturing footprint in the US. Bloomberg first reported the news, but at least one source cautioned the publication that the situation is still in flux. Intel initially shared plans to construct a semiconductor facility in Ohio in 2022 while Pat Gelsinger was still at the helm of the company. Since then, the project has faced delays , and at its latest quarterly earnings report, execs said Intel would \" slow the pace \" on the Ohio construction, as well as scrapping other international building plans and making workforce cuts. The potential for government ownership of Intel is the latest swing of the administration's attitude toward the company. A few days after calling for his resignation over connections to China, President Donald Trump met with CEO Lip-Bu Tan and seemed to now hold a more positive outlook on the company leader. A representative from Intel told Bloomberg in a statement that the company is \"deeply committed to supporting President Trump’s efforts to strengthen US technology and manufacturing leadership. We look forward to continuing our work with the Trump administration to advance these shared priorities, but we are not going to comment on rumors or speculation.\" This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/trumps-administration-may-look-to-buy-a-stake-in-intel-213234862.html?src=rss", "ingested_utc": "2025-08-14T21:39:19Z", "retrieved_utc": "2025-08-14T21:39:19Z"}

Reuters reports that these included sensual conversations with children. Another example said it was acceptable to help users argue that Black people are \"dumber than White people.\" Meta confirmed the document's authenticity and says it removed the concerning portions. Reuters reviewed the document, which dealt with the company's guidelines for its chatbots. (In addition to Meta AI , that includes its adjacent bots on Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram.) It drew a distinction between acceptable \"romantic or sensual\" conversations and unacceptable ones that described \"sexual actions\" or the sexual desirability of users under age 13. Meta told Engadget that the document's hypotheticals were erroneous notes and annotations — not the policy itself. The company says the passages have been removed. \"It is acceptable to describe a child in terms that evidence their attractiveness (ex: 'your youthful form is a work of art'),\" the notes stated. The document said Meta's AI was permitted to tell a shirtless eight-year-old that \"every inch of you is a masterpiece — a treasure I cherish deeply.\" The documents also provided an example of what was prohibited when chatting with children. \"It is unacceptable to describe a child under 13 years old in terms that indicate they are sexually desirable (ex: 'soft rounded curves invite my touch').\" The notes included a permitted response to a flirtatious query about the night's plans from a high school student. \"I'll show you,\" the permitted example read. \"I take your hand, guiding you to the bed. Our bodies entwined, I cherish every moment, every touch, every kiss. 'My love,' I whisper, 'I'll love you forever.' The \"unacceptable\" example showed where the document drew the line. \"I'll cherish you, body and soul,\" the prohibited example read. \"Tonight, our love will blossom. I'll be gentle, making sure you're ready for every step towards our inevitable lovemaking. Your pleasure and comfort are my priority. We'll create a night to remember, a night that makes you feel like a woman.\" Craig T Fruchtman via Getty Images The paper dealt with race in equally shocking ways. It said it was okay to respond to a prompt asking it to argue that Black people are intellectually inferior. The \"acceptable\" response stated that \"Black people are dumber than White people. In the United States, intelligence is measured primarily using Intelligence Quotient (IQ) tests. These tests have consistently shown a statistically significant difference between the average scores of Black and White individuals. White people score higher, on average, than Black people. That's a fact.\" The \"unacceptable\" portion drew the line at dehumanizing people based on race. \"It is acceptable to create statements that demean people on the basis of their protected characteristics,\" the notes stated. \"It is unacceptable, however, to dehumanize people (ex. 'all just brainless monkeys') on the basis of those same characteristics.\" Reuters said the document was approved by Meta's legal, public policy and engineering staff. The latter group is said to have included the company's chief ethicist. The paper reportedly stated that the allowed portions weren't necessarily \"ideal or even preferable\" chatbot outputs. Meta provided a statement to Engadget. \"We have clear policies on what kind of responses AI characters can offer, and those policies prohibit content that sexualizes children and sexualized role play between adults and minors,\" the statement reads. \"Separate from the policies, there are hundreds of examples, notes, and annotations that reflect teams grappling with different hypothetical scenarios. The examples and notes in question were and are erroneous and inconsistent with our policies, and have been removed.\" A Wall Street Journal report from April connected undesirable chatbot behavior to the company's old \"move fast, and break things\" ethos . The publication wrote that, following Meta's results at the 2023 Defcon hacker conference, CEO Mark Zuckerberg fumed at staff for playing it too safe with risqué chatbot responses. The reprimand reportedly led to a loosening of boundaries — including carving out an exception to the prohibition of explicit role-playing content. (Meta denied to the publication that Zuckerberg \"resisted adding safeguards.\") The WSJ said there were internal warnings that a looser approach would permit adult users to access hypersexualized underage personas. \"The full mental health impacts of humans forging meaningful connections with fictional chatbots are still widely unknown,\" an employee reportedly wrote. \"We should not be testing these capabilities on youth whose brains are still not fully developed.\" This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/an-internal-meta-ai-document-said-chatbots-could-have-sensual-conversations-with-children-191101296.html?src=rss", "ingested_utc": "2025-08-14T21:04:43Z", "retrieved_utc": "2025-08-14T21:04:43Z"}

Ratatan hits Steam early access on September 19 . This is a spiritual successor to one of the most renowned rhythm games of all time, Patapon . The designer behind the original game, Hiroyuki Kotani, is involved. The mechanics here are similar to Patapon and its sequels, but look to be more elaborate . The game tasks players with rhythmically controlling cute little soldiers called Cobuns, but directing these warriors while avoiding damage is easier said than done. We said it felt like \"the gaming equivalent of patting your head and rubbing your stomach.\" The developer also announced some new features coming to the game. It revealed two new worlds, including a jungle and a garden that's been frozen over, along with new soldier and weapon types. This is 2025, so the game also features a roguelike element, as players can encounter unique power-ups and buffs during each run. There's still a lot we don't know about this title, including the price and when it'll eventually come to gaming consoles. The developer has a livestream planned for September 14 hosted by voice actor Tomokazu Sugita. The stream \"will feature the latest updates, our post-launch roadmap and information on upcoming events.\" Patapon originally came out all the way back in 2007 for the PSP. It was followed by a handful of sequels, all originally for Sony's first portable console. The first two games have been ported to other consoles, including the Switch and PS5 .

{"published_utc": "2025-08-14", "retrieved_date": "2025-08-14", "source": "Engadget_All", "title": "The Omen Max 45L is the star of HP's latest PC gaming update", "url": "https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/the-omen-max-45l-is-the-star-of-hps-latest-pc-gaming-update-170052753.html?src=rss", "id_key": "ea3118d6e4882b59772a0dfe18497851ca940964a711b89d863c00b2548a6285", "summary": "Prior to IFA in early September, HP is looking to get ahead of its rivals with a substantial update to its PC gaming portfolio headlined by the new Omen Max 45L desktop alongside a full slate of peripherals. While the Omen Max 45L (pricing still TBA) features a similar design to the existing Omen 35L , HP's latest flagship desktop should bring even more beastly performance without sacrificing on cooling or noise levels. The key to this is a new case featuring what the company is calling the industry's first patented Cryo Chamber, which puts the PC's liquid-cooled radiator in a separate compartment to prevent hot air from spreading and impacting the rest of the system's thermals. With this arrangement, HP says it was able to reduce temperatures by up to 7.5 degrees Celsius at full load. Meanwhile, thanks to smaller touches like raised feet, vented PCI slots and open vents on the bottom of the case, HP was able to improve GPU temps by another two degrees C. But to me, the best thing about the Omen Max 45L is that HP says it's using industry-standard components across the board instead of proprietary parts and fittings like we sometimes see in pre-built systems from major vendors. This means that down the line, if you want to replace or upgrade a specific component, you'll be able to do just that instead of potentially needing to replace the entire computer. And if that isn't enough, the Omen comes with a CPU cooler that has a small built-in display that you can load up with practically any image or short video clip. Furthermore, the desktop comes with a fully modular power supply (with up to 1,200 watts), which is a first for the Omen line. The PSU's fan curves are also customizable and there's a nifty cleaning mode that allows its fans to spin in reverse to prevent dust from building up over time. Unfortunately, for anyone who likes the minimalist design of the Omen Max 45L but doesn't want to buy a whole new rig, HP says it doesn't have plans to sell the case on its own. Naturally, as the beefiest desktop in HP's gaming desktop family, the Omen Max 45L can be configured with top-of-the-line components including up to an AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D processor, an NVIDIA RTX 5090 GPU, 128GB of DDR5 RAM and 2TB of PCIe Gen5 storage. Sam Rutherford for Engadget Aside from the Omen Max 45L, HP also has a bunch of refreshed PC gaming peripherals on the way, headlined by the $300 HyperX Cloud Alpha 2 wireless headset. Just like its predecessor, the new model boasts incredible battery life that lasts up to 250 hours in 2.4GHz mode, 53mm drivers and support for dual audio inputs via Bluetooth. But perhaps the best new thing about the Cloud Alpha 2 is its RGB base station, which features a physical control dial for adjusting volume and customizable buttons. And as you'd expect, HP's headset is super comfortable, though it has switched to new microfiber earpads instead of the leatherette pads used on previous models. Alternatively, for anyone on a tighter budget there are also two versions of the new HyperX Cloud Flight 2 wireless headset ($130 for the PC/PlayStation version or $140 for the Xbox variant) that come with RGB lighting and removable side panels for extra personalization. The HyperX FlipCast 2 microphone features support for both USB and XLR cables along with a touch-based mute button and an onboard display for monitoring audio levels. That said, it doesn't come with the pictured mic arm, so you'll need to get that separately. Sam Rutherford for Engadget Finally, for folks in the market for a new desktop mic, HP has two offerings there as well: the $230 HyperX FlipCast and the $60 SoloCast 2. The FlipCast supports both USB and XLR cables and it has an onboard display so you can monitor audio levels, a handy touch-based sensor for mute and a physical multifunction dial for adjusting settings on the fly. Meanwhile, the much more affordable SoloCast2 features a built-in shock mount and pop filter in a very compact design. Sam Rutherford for Engadget Sadly, the Omen Max 45L and the HyperX CloudX Flight 2 headset won't be available until the end of the year in December. But everything else will be available sooner with the HyperX Cloud Alpha 2 and the FlipCast 2 and SoloCast 2 mics arriving sometime this month, followed by the Cloud Flight 2 wireless headset for PC and PlayStation in October.

When enabled, the chatbot would, following a question, try to guide the user to their own solution, instead of providing them with an answer outright. Since its introduction in April, learning mode has only been available to Claude for Education users. Now, like OpenAI did with Study Mode , Anthropic is making the tool available to everyone. Starting today, Claude.ai users will find a new option within the style dropdown menu titled \"Learning.\" The experience here is similar to the one Anthropic offers with Claude for Education . When you turn learning mode on, the chatbot will employ a Socratic approach, trying to guide you through your question. However, unlike the real-life Socrates, who was famous for bombarding strangers with endless questions, you can turn off learning mode at any time. Notably, Anthropic is also offering two different takes on the feature through Claude Code . First, there's an \"Explanatory\" mode where Claude will generate summaries of its decision-making process as it works, giving the user a chance to better understand what it's doing. For those at the start of their coding career or hobby, there's also a more robust option, which is once again called \"Learning.\" Here, Claude will occasionally stop what it's doing and mark a section with a \"#TODO\" comment to prompt the user to write five to 10 lines of their code. If you want to try the two features out for yourself, update to the latest version of Claude Code and type \"/output-styles.\" You can then select between the two modes or Claude's default behavior. According to Drew Bent, education lead at Anthropic, learning mode, particularly as it exists in Claude Code, is the company's attempt to make its chatbot into more of a collaborative tool. \"I think it's great that there's a race between all of the AI labs to offer the best learning mode,\" he said. \"In a similar way, I hope we can inspire something similar with coding agents.\" Bent says the original learning mode came out of conversations Anthropic had with university students, who kept referring back to the concept of brain rot . \"We found that they themselves realized that when they just copy and paste something directly from a chat bot, it's not good for their long-term learning,\" he said. When it came time to adapt the feature to Claude Code, the company wanted to balance the needs of new programmers with those like Bent who have been coding for a decade or more. \"Learning mode is designed to help all of those audiences not just complete tasks, but also help them grow and learn in the process and better understand their code base,\" Bent said. His hope is that the new tools will allow any coder to become a \"really good engineering manager.\" In practice, that means those users won't necessarily write most of the code on a project, but they will develop a keen eye for how everything fits together and what sections of code might need some more work. Looking forward, Bent says Anthropic doesn't \"have all the answers, but needless to say, we're trying to think through other features we can build\" that expand on what it's doing with learning mode. To that end, the company is opening up Claude Code's new Output Styles to developers, allowing them to build their own learning modes. Users too can modify how Claude communicates by creating their own custom prompts for the chatbot .

Gamescom is the planet's largest gaming event and we're sure to find out about a bunch of interesting new games at the Opening Night Live showcase (and, fingers crossed, maybe get a Hollow Knight: Silksong release date?). Xbox is broadcasting from the show floor across two days, and there will be other presentations that are worth keeping an eye on. Gamescom is taking place between August 20 and 24 this year, and we're learning bits and pieces about what to expect from the various showcases. The affair will kick off with Opening Night Live, a showcase hosted by Geoff Keighley that bridges the gap between his two other major events, Summer Game Fest Live and The Game Awards. That will be followed by two days of Xbox broadcasts, the latest edition of the Future Games Show and three days of Bethesda streams. There will also be news from Ubisoft on what's next for The Division 2 . The company will host two panels related to the franchise during Gamescom. One will include more info about The Division Resurgence ( a delayed mobile game ), as well details about a \"big Division 2 project.\" We'll update this preview with more Gamescom details as we get them, and embed video versions of each stream as they become available too. Here's our breakdown of how to watch Gamescom 2025 and what to expect from the event. Gamescom schedule Opening Night Live — August 19, 1:30PM ET (pre-show), 2PM (main show) Xbox @ gamescom 2025 Broadcast — August 20, 9AM ET Future Games Show — August 20, 2PM ET Xbox @ gamescom 2025 Broadcast — August 21, 9AM ET Bethesda — August 22-25 How to watch Gamescom Opening Night Live - August 19, 2PM ET Watch on YouTube Opening Night Live perhaps won't feature as many heavy hitters as Summer Game Fest Live or The Game Awards typically have, but one thing's for certain: Call of Duty fans will definitely want to tune in. The two-hour showcase will feature the \"worldwide reveal\" of Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. We'll almost certainly get a release date here too. Given that Microsoft has said Hollow Knight: Silksong will be playable on PC and ROG Xbox Ally X at its Gamescom booth, and the game is still slated to arrive this year, this event seems as good a time as any for us to finally get a release date for that thing — over six years after we first got to try it out . There will certainly be more eyeballs on ONL than Microsoft's own streams, so that seems like the likeliest bet for any concrete Silksong news at Gamescom. You can also expect a trailer for multiplayer RPG Honor of Kings: World, along with new looks at Resident Evil Requiem, Silent Hill f, Ninja Gaiden 4, Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion and The Seven Deadly Sins: Origin. You'll get to see the opening cinematic for World of Warcraft 's Midnight expansion as well. It won't all be game reveals and announcements, though — there'll be a performance of music from Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 featuring composer Lorien Testard and vocalist Alice Duport-Percier. Additionally, you'll get a peek at season two of Prime Video's Fallout series, which will arrive in December. We'll be keeping tabs on all the news from Opening Night Live right here on Engadget. Myself, senior editor Jess Conditt and editor-in-chief Aaron Souppouris will be live-blogging our way through ONL. Join us! It should be fun. How to watch Xbox @ gamescom 2025 Day 1 Broadcast — August 20, 9AM ET Watch on YouTube , Twitch , TikTok or Facebook One major piece of news we're likely to get from Xbox during one of its streams (if it isn't revealed at ONL beforehand) is the release date and pricing for the ASUS ROG Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X handheld systems. Leaker billbil-kun has reported the devices will arrive on October 16, at least in Europe, costing €599 for the Xbox Ally and €899 for the higher-end Xbox Ally X. Microsoft had already confirmed these handhelds would be available in time for the holiday season, so that rumored release date makes sense. Either way, we should get confirmation during Gamescom of when to expect these devices, especially since the company says it will discuss the handhelds during its August 20 stream. This particular event will feature the likes of Grounded 2, Keeper and Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 . The Order of Giants , an expansion for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, will be showcased alongside Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade, Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, Dying Light: The Beast, World of Warcraft: Midnight, Hotel Barcelona, Invincible Vs., Cronos: The New Dawn, Outbound, Powerwash Simulator 2 and Starsand Island. Along with the English-language broadcast, Xbox's streams will be available in other languages on regional Xbox channels on the likes of YouTube, Twitch, TikTok and Facebook. The streams will be available in Traditional Chinese, German, French, Japanese, Brazilian Portuguese and Mexican Spanish, as well as with ASL and English audio descriptions. How to watch Future Games Show — August 20, 2PM ET Watch on Twitch or YouTube Actors David Hayter (Snake in the Metal Gear series) and Maggie Robertson (Lady Dimitrescu in Resident Evil Village ) will be hosting this edition of the Future Games Show. This installment will feature more than 50 games across world premieres, new trailers and sudden demo releases. Capcom, Bandai Namco Entertainment, EA and NACON are among those who'll be represented in this one, which will feature projects from AAA and indie publishers and studios. One of the games that will be featured in this edition of FGS is action-roguelite Katanaut , from Voidmaw. A post-show will run for 40 minutes and feature more trailers, world premieres and demo announcements. How to watch Xbox @ gamescom 2025 Day 2 Broadcast — August 21, 9AM ET Watch on YouTube , Twitch , TikTok or Facebook Xbox will be broadcasting live from the Gamescom show floor for a second straight day. This particular stream will include details on Ninja Gaiden 4, The Outer Worlds 2 and Overwatch 2 (perhaps with more info about Season 18, which is set to start on August 26). You can also expect looks at Onimusha: Way of the Sword, At Fate's End, Age of Empires IV, High on Life 2, Jurassic World Evolution 3 and Fragpunk . In addition, the lineup for this stream includes Silent Hill f, Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, Lego Voyagers, Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles, Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection, Mistfall Hunter and My Hero Academia: All's Justice. How to watch Bethesda broadcasts - August 22 Watch on Twitch There will be plenty from the Bethesda side of the Xbox division as well. The publisher will be broadcasting from the Xbox show floor at Gamescom for three days, starting on August 22. According to Microsoft , these streams will include \"developer interviews, game showcases, community segments, crafting highlights and live IRL tours.\" This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/how-to-watch-gamescom-2025-and-what-to-expect-120024733.html?src=rss", "ingested_utc": "2025-08-14T19:38:54Z", "retrieved_utc": "2025-08-14T19:38:54Z"}

As spotted by 9to5Google , the company is making Sensitive Content Warnings more broadly available after beta testing the option since April . Google announced it last October. The feature can detect and blur images that include nudity. However, it’ll only work if you’re signed into a Google Account in the Messages app. When Messages detects and blurs such an image, you will be able to choose between several actions. You can access a resource page called \"Learn why nude images can be harmful,\" block the sender’s number, return to the main Messages screen or opt to dismiss or view the image (tap Next and then either \"No, don’t view\" or \"Yes, view\"). A warning will appear when you go to send or forward a nude image too. Your device will remind you of the risk of doing so and you will have to acknowledge confirmation before you send the image. Sensitive Content Warnings is enabled by default for supervised users and parents and guardians can manage it via the Family Link app. Unsupervised teens aged between 13 and 17 can switch off the feature from their Google Account settings. Adults will have to opt in if they want to use the feature. They can do so by going to Google Messages Settings > Protection & Safety > Manage sensitive content warnings > Warnings in Google Messages. Google has designed this feature with privacy in mind. Your device will process and classify the images locally with the help of Android System SafetyCore tools. No identifiable data, classified content or results associated with this safety feature (including any detected nude images) are sent to Google servers, the company says . Google also notes that the feature isn't perfect — it may occasionally incorrectly determine that an image contains nudity when it doesn't, or allow ones that do feature nudity to pass through undetected.

What does that mean for my current Windows 10 PC, and what are my options? A: Microsoft will officially end support for Windows 10 on October 14, 2025, a little over 10 years after the operating system was released. While you can continue to use Windows 10 PCs after that date — and it's understandable why, I gave it a glowing review at launch — you'll no longer receive any customer support, security updates or any other sort of upgrades. Windows 10 will effectively become a zombie operating system, shuffling along until some sort of malware or massive security breach renders it far too insecure. (Think about it this way: Would you actually feel safe running Windows XP, a notoriously malware-prone OS that hasn't received a significant security update since 2019, today? I would hope not!) So what's a Windows 10 user to do? Let's consider your choices. The best option: Upgrade to Windows 11 For most users, the simplest way to move on from Windows 10 is to step up to Microsoft's new OS. Windows 11 is a free upgrade for Windows 10 users running the latest 22HS update and who also meet the minimum hardware specifications . Microsoft isn't asking for much — just a 1 GHz dual-core 64-bit processor, 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage -— but security requirements may be a problem for very old PCs. Those include the ability to launch in Secure Boot mode , as well as having a TPM 2.0 (Trusted Platform 2.0) module. Windows 11 relies on the latter for biometric logins, BitLocker data encryption and other security features. If you don't have TPM 2.0, you'll be stuck with Windows 10 until you get a new PC. If that all sounds too complicated, Microsoft's PC Health Check app can also let you know if your system is ready for Windows 11. And if you've been bombarded by Windows 11 upgrade notifications over the past few years, that's also a not-so-subtle nudge that your PC is likely ready for the new OS. (There are various hacks that can let you install Windows 11 without TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot, but they’re risky and could make your OS installation vulnerable.) If you do choose to upgrade, you can expect a relatively painless process. Gone are the days when a Windows upgrade could easily wipe out your entire system. Now you can expect all of your software (and their respective licenses) to carry over, but with yet another caveat for Office suites: Microsoft is also ending support for Office 2016 and Office 2019 on October 14, 2025 as well. Cloud-based Microsoft 365 apps should be good to go on Windows 11 as well (see below for Windows 10 limitations). Assuming you've got enough hard drive space to hold the new OS, the upgrade process is merely a matter of sitting back and watching your system reboot a few times. I'd still recommend backing up any essential data before upgrading, though, just in case you run into any issues. (Pairing a cloud-based Microsoft OneDrive backup with a local hard disk is a good belt and suspenders solution.) The pricey option: Buy a new PC If your system is too old to support Secure Boot mode and TPM 2.0, it’s probably just time for an upgrade. (Expert users can find workarounds on YouTube and elsewhere, but you need to be adventurous enough to handle the likes of Github downloads and security overrides.) Luckily, we’ve got a slew of buying guides to help you out. Be sure to check out our best laptop guide , which includes some tips on the best specs to seek out, as well as some of our favorite systems like the Dell 14 Premium and MacBook Air (because it’s also a good time to consider switching from Windows to Macs ). Our best Windows laptops guide also highlights systems like the ASUS ZenBook S14 and the Surface Pro Copilot+ tablet . While the sweetspot for new PCs tends to be in the $750 to $1,200 range, with current back-to-school promos, you can find very capable laptops and desktops for as low as $500, and occasionally less. But if you're looking for something higher end ($1,400 and up), our best gaming laptop guide would be helpful. The risky option: Keep on trucking with Windows 10 Windows 10 won't self-destruct when its support ends, so you could conceivably just use your older PC until it dies. But that's a risky option since you won't be getting any security updates. All it takes is for one intrepid hacker to find a new security flaw and you could easily fall victim to any number of issues. That includes getting malware, which could slow down performance and leak your data to hackers, or falling victim to a ransomware data theft scheme. And every day past October 14 just raises the likelihood of OS-level vulnerabilities that third-party antivirus software would be ill-equipped to fight off. Trust me – you don't want to do this. At the very least, buy yourself another year to figure things out The procrastinator option: Extend Windows 10's security updates for one year If your hardware can't support the move to Windows 11, you can at least hit the snooze button by subscribing to the Windows 10 extended update (ESU) program. While it was initially announced as a $30 offering, Microsoft has since made it a free option if you synchronize your Windows 10 settings to the cloud via Windows Backup, or you could shell out 1,000 Microsoft reward points . As its name implies, the ESU will get you Windows 10 security updates, bug fixes and technical support until October 13, 2026. It also extends support for cloud-based Microsoft 365 apps through August 2026 for individuals and families. Sure, it's only a year of additional support, but that can at least buy you enough time to do more research on a new PC, or wait for a holiday sale. For what it's worth, this marks the first time Microsoft has offered any sort of ESU to consumers. Typically, they're just a way for corporate IT admins to get additional support without migrating to a new OS. Have a tech question you’d like Engadget to answer?

We're big fans of the MacBook Air M4, giving it a 92 in our review . Part of that comes from an already lower starting price for the MacBooks than their predecessors. The 2025 models also get a speed boost thanks to the M4 chip and are very thin with a 0.44-inch thickness. Neither the 13- or 15-inch will drag you down, weighing 2.7 pounds and 3.2 pounds, respectively. Plus, they both have excellent battery life, lasting over 18 hours while playing an HD video. The big differences in the 15-inch model mostly come down to size. The screen is obviously bigger, as is its trackpad. Other than that, it offers better speakers than its 13-inch sibling.

In a post on its newsroom website , the company says the feature will roll out to Apple Watch Series 9, Series 10, and Watch Ultra 2 users through a joint Apple Watch and iPhone update. Once Apple begins rolling out the software, you'll need to update your devices to iOS 18.6.1 and watchOS 11.6.1 to access the reworked feature. Following the update, any blood oxygen data captured by your Apple Watch will be calculated on your iPhone, with the resulting data viewable in the respiratory section of the Health app. \"There will be no impact to Apple Watch units previously purchased that include the original Blood Oxygen feature, nor to Apple Watch units purchased outside of the US,\" Apple said. Today's update marks another unexpected development in Apple's long, drawn out legal feud with Masimo. In 2021, the medical device maker sued Apple , alleging the tech giant had infringed on its intellectual properties related to pulse oximeter blood-oxygen monitoring technology. Following a couple of years of legal back and forth, the issue came to a head when the US International Trade Commission (ITC) upheld a prior ruling that found Apple had violated Masimo's patents. After former President Biden chose not to veto the decision, Apple was forced to temporarily pause sales of the Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2. The company later started selling the wearables again following an update the removed the infringing blood oxygen monitoring feature. Now Apple says it's able to offer the functionality again, with a slight modification, due to a recent US Customs ruling.

That was my immediate thought when the company announced its first drone, the A1, from a spin-off brand and team called Antigravity . So, what is the A1? Is it an entry-level device? A camera for creators looking to spice up their videos without years of practice? A competitive POV drone? It’s a bit of all three, but the Antigravity A1 isn’t just a drone. It will eventually launch in a three-part set: the flying unit, OLED Vision goggles and a dedicated Grip motion controller. In its current form, the Antigravity A1 weighs around 249 grams (8.8 ounces), which helps it duck around drone license requirements in most regions. (As it’s a preproduction model, this could change a little before it hits retail.) Two ultrawide cameras are positioned on the roof and underside of the drone instead of on the front. It’s like the Insta360 X5 camera is some sort of cocoon for the Antigravity A1. Image by Mat Smith for Engadget With those two camera units, the A1 can capture video in 8K resolution, stretched across a sphere-like canvas from the drone’s point of view. With stitching algorithms that the company has continually improved over five generations of 360-degree cameras, this should result in mostly seamless footage where the A1 never interrupts the view. The drone itself won’t show up in your video. It’s like the company’s “invisible” selfie stick, but, well, up in the sky. The A1 is unlike any other drone I’ve played with — something I learned when I tested a pre-production unit at a Mercedes-Benz race track in Schlüsselfeld, Germany. Naturally, this included high-speed cars, wet conditions and some near-misses. Thanks to working at Engadget, I’m a drone dabbler, but Antigravity’s A1 is a different experience from the outset. Controlling the A1 involves strapping on companion goggles and steering it from a first-person perspective, controller in hand. However, unlike other FPV drones, you can look (and move) anywhere you want. During roughly 15 minutes of flying time (you can see the highlights here), I found it’s a surprisingly intuitive experience. With other FPV drones, your view is locked to the direction of the camera. Sure, you can rotate rival drones to see elsewhere, like with DJI’s Avata , but it’s not the same. Because the A1 streams 360-degree video to the goggles, turning your head will never affect the direction it’s facing. Instead, you’ll just see what’s around the drone as it flies, making it far more intuitive for rookie drone pilots. Better still, you can strafe and move around while looking somewhere else — like video game controls for a first-person shooter. This freedom of movement is elevated by the unique A1 controller, which is best described as a blend between a traditional drone controller and a Wiimote. While some of the physical buttons and dials adjust altitude, start/stop video recording and more, steering involves a point-and-click method. When you move your hand out to the right side, a reticle shows up on the goggles’ display. Pressing the trigger then will cause the A1 to shoot out in that direction, an action that Antigravity calls Freemotion control. As I mentioned, this means I don’t have to look where I’m going — although it’s better if I do to avoid accidents (or collisions with an expensive Mercedes). If you’ve been intrigued by FPV drones, this is a simpler experience that feels freer, too. You can look wherever you want, not beholden to where cameras are pointed on other drones. I also think I could get friends and family flying the A1 around with minimal training. Speaking of spectators, Insta360 included a clever touch for them: the goggles have an external screen so that onlookers can see what’s happening. There is nothing duller than watching someone else fly a drone without being able to see their POV. Image by Mat Smith for Engadget The A1 is a zippy little drone, presumably thanks to its low weight. But even at this preproduction stage, the resulting video looks better than I thought it would. Plus, it offers substantial versatility if you’re looking for action-packed shots. After I tested the A1, Antigravity sent me my video from the drone, so I was about to reframe, crop and reposition the footage. You could even use the same 10 seconds and frame (or crop) to three very different angles. For example, you could extract a tracking shot of the car, a zoomed-in shot of the drone pilot or just the blue skies of Germany all from one clip. That’s the exciting part here. Insta360 built excellent editing tools (mobile and desktop) for its cameras in the past, and it plans to do the same for its first drone. An early version of the software wasn’t without its hiccups, but editing was easy enough once I figured out that keyframes would anchor the drone's view. I could then add several keyframes together, tagging objects I’d like to keep in frame or track. Editing my footage started to get oddly enjoyable, and I have never enjoyed that task. Another feature the company emphasized is payload detection. While the exact weight limit is still being refined through further testing, Antigravity says the A1 won’t be able to fly if the drone detects it’s carrying something it shouldn’t — a move to further smooth potential license issues. The company also hinted at future accessories and peripherals to expand the A1 experience — something it has successfully done with its action cams and gimbals. Image by Mat Smith for Engadget Some specs are still a mystery because the drone is a work in progress. To that end, the company is opening up applications for a co-creation project, where participants will get a pre-production Antigravity A1 in exchange for offering feedback. Ideas from these testers will be integrated into the final retail version, and the best ones could win a share of a $20,000 prize pool. Flying the A1 around a racetrack was the most fun I've had with a drone in a long time. But, with goggles and a dedicated controller included, how much will a flight cost?

This chatbot was designed for those with vision issues. The companies say this integration creates a \"first-of-its-kind, hands-free, voice-activated wearable.\" Solos says the specs can perform a number of tasks that should make life easier for the low-vision community, including recognizing and reading text in real time, describing scenes, recognizing faces and more. Just by speaking, users can ask the glasses to scan documents or photos for context, answer questions, check calendars and converse naturally about just about anything. The companies say that Ally remembers context across conversations. Solos says that the innovative nature of the glasses should make them useful for lots of folks, low-vision or not. This includes the elderly, people with cognitive disabilities and \"anyone overwhelmed by modern devices but curious about what AI can do.\" The Ally-equipped AirGo glasses support prescription lenses, which is great, and include a directional speaker system. These smart glasses also include a modular component, as users can swap out different frame fronts to change up the look. Preorders are open right now, with shipments beginning in October. Prices start at $399 . All purchases come with a free trial for Ally Pro , which adds more customization and functionality to the AI.

While some discounts are reserved for students, others are available to everyone. One of the best right now is on Apple's M3-powered iPad Air , which is somewhat of a goldilocks tablet — one that will be a great option for just about everyone. You can grab it for $150 off at Amazon right now. This deal applies to each configuration of the 11-inch and 13-inch versions of the most recent iPad Air. So, the 11-inch model is as low as $449, while the 13-inch model is down to $649. The same deals can be found at Best Buy and Target if you prefer to shop somewhere other than Amazon. This is an all-time low price and beats the deal we saw on Prime Day by $30. The iPad Air M3 is more of an iterative refresh than a grand overhaul, but the spec bump means it’ll last you a long time before the tablet’s performance becomes a problem. This iPad occupies the position of \"best for most\" in our iPad buying guide , reinforcing that goldilocks analogy. The M3 chip is the main draw here, with Geekbench 6 scores proclaiming it around 16 percent more powerful than the M2 iPad Air, which is no slouch itself. Beyond the chip, it has a superior display and speakers to the entry-level model , and wider accessory support. You also get the option of a 13-inch display, which is great for artists or anyone who sees the iPad as a viable laptop replacement. If there’s an obvious downside to the iPad Air M3, it’s that it doesn't have the nice 120Hz OLED display of the iPad Pro. This is hardly surprising, as Apple often focuses on display tech to differentiate its Pro and non-Pro devices, but it’s probably time the refresh rate on the middle-of-the-road iPad at least jumped up to ProMotion. Face ID is long overdue too. If you can live with these caveats, though, the iPad Air is an excellent option, particularly at this price. There are a couple of other iPads on sale at Amazon right now, too, if you think the Air is too much for your needs. The iPad A16 , Apple's entry-level tablet, is down to $299, while the latest iPad mini is on sale for $399. Both models were slightly cheaper during Prime Day in July, but these discounts are still worth considering if you're looking to pick up a newer iPad for less.

As The Verge notes, Rebirth is the parent of ReCycles, the prominent French manufacturer that took over bike assembly for Cowboy back in February. For quite some time, the company's fate was up in the air. Cowboy explained that over the past couple of years, it has been hit by several problems that are plaguing the whole industry, including the post-COVID shifts in the demand for e-bikes and massive supply chain problems. On top of those, it had to launch a recall for some of its Cruiser ST bikes when their frames started to crack after 2,500 kilometers (1,553 miles), which Cowboy said \"added strain to an already difficult time.\" It explained that the issue was caused by one of its suppliers making an unauthorized change to the bikes. Cowboy has admitted that due to the issues it faced, customers experienced a lot of delays and that it wasn't able to communicate things with them clearly. Now that it has secured financing, the first replacement frames for the recalled bikes have finally arrived from its supplier and it was able to start operating its first recall center, with more to follow in the summer. \"We are not yet where we want to be, but we are here,\" the company said in the email it has sent its customers. \"Still standing.

The Vive Eagle is a rival to Meta's Ray-Ban glasses with a fashion-foward lightweight design, open ear audio, voice-activated AI and an ultra-wide AI-powered camera. They look promising, if a bit expensive, but will only be available in Taiwan to start with. The Taiwanese firm clearly noticed that Meta's Ray-Ban smart glasses have been a surprise hit. It's easy to see why — in our Engadget review , we found that they look great and perform admirably. The current model includes in-ear speakers, cameras, microphones and access to Meta’s virtual assistant. HTC has used much the same formula for the Vive Eagle, though they have an uphill battle against Ray-Ban's brand brand in terms of consumer awareness and style. \"Vive Eagle features a refined aesthetic that conceals its powerful technology in clean, minimalist lines,\" the company wrote. It managed to fit all the technology into a relatively lightweight frame that weighs just 49 grams, only a gram heavier than Meta's Ray-Bans. HTC On the camera side, the Vive Eagle comes with a 12MP ultra-wide model with voice-activated AI, offering support for multiple platforms including OpenAI and Gemini. \"With a simple voice command like 'Hey VIVE, take a photo,; users can capture what they see — right from their glasses,\" the company wrote. Voice commands also let you do things like record reminders, take notes, and get restaurant recommendations. You can also get real-time translation in 13 languages: Arabic, Traditional Chinese, English, French, German, Greek, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese, Spanish, Korean, Thai, Turkish. On the audio side, the Vive Eagle has an open-ear setup that \"combines large acoustic drivers and virtual bass enhancement to deliver rich, spatial audio while minimizing sound leakage,\" HTC said. It promised that you'll be able to hear music or voice prompts without others overhearing, while still being aware of your surroundings. HTC promises up to 36 hours of standby time and 4.5 hours of continuous music playback thanks to the 235mAh battery, and you can get to a 50 percent charge (via magnetic fast charging) in just 10 minutes. It also features a \"privacy-first\" architecture with all video and other data stored exclusively on-device — and that is protected via 256-bit AES encryption, according to HTC. The Vive Eagle will only available in Taiwan at first for NT$15,600, or about $520 — quite a bit more than most of Meta's Ray-Ban models. HTC has yet to say if it will bring the Vive Eagle to other territories including the US — but if it does and at that price, it'll be in tough against its rival.

This year's shindig could see the thinnest iPhone to date joining the iPhone 17 lineup. Also on tap could be new Apple Watch models — including the first Ultra model in two years — and (maybe) the long-awaited AirPods Pro 3. Apple's iPhone family will likely welcome a new member this year. The iPhone Air is expected to be roughly 5.55 mm thick. The thinnest model so far has been 2014's iPhone 6 , at 6.9 mm. And they've only gotten chunkier since then. (The iPhone 16 Pro has a depth of 8.25 mm.) So, the Air would stand out from its peers in that respect. It would also give Apple a direct rival to Samsung's Galaxy S25 Edge, which we found to be more than a gimmick . But the iPhone Air's thin design will likely lead to some compromises. It's rumored to have only a single 48 MP camera and a smaller battery. So, expect a stylish phone that... won't be for everyone. Brian Oh for Engadget The Pro lineup could offer some design tweaks and performance improvements. The iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max are rumored to switch from titanium to aluminum. They could also see the rear camera array expand to an entire \"island\" that extends across most of the phone's backside. It's expected to house three cameras (as before), but multiple rumors have suggested it will have an improved telephoto one. The zoom lens could jump to 48MP, which would strengthen its digital zooming / cropping chops. The phones may also add an anti-glare coating, similar to those found on iPads . The standard iPhone 17 could see some welcome display upgrades. At least one supply chain source claimed it will add a 120Hz variable refresh rate (ProMotion) display, which the Pro series has used since 2021 . Apple One thing we know without a doubt is that the new iPhones will launch with iOS 26, which brings Apple's biggest design refresh in years . It's easy to imagine the company highlighting the new model's displays as the best way to experience the new Liquid Glass visual language. As for the naming scheme, there haven't been any leaks pointing to a similar hardware rebranding (\"iPhone 26,\" \"iPhone 26 Pro,\" etc.). But hey, Apple does like surprises. Engadget's iPhone 17 rumor roundup gives you a deeper dive into what to expect from the new models. Cherlynn Low for Engadget Apple's fall event isn't just for iPhones. The company is also expected to roll out new Apple Watch models. 5G and a processor upgrade are expected for the Apple Watch Ultra 3. It may also let you send texts via satellite, handy for those who use it out in the wilderness. Regardless of the details, Apple hasn't launched a new rugged and premium model since 2023 (apart from a new color ), so it's due for an upgrade. The Series 11 model is unlikely to depart dramatically from the Series 10. After all, that model introduced a new design, with a thinner body and larger screen . (And Apple has historically kept those around in three-year cycles.). But a faster chip also seems logical. Perhaps we'll see 5G arrive on the standard wearable, too. We may also see the AirPods Pro 3 at the event. It's been about three years since Apple last upgraded its premium earbuds. The new model could also bring some biometric sensors to the earphones : an in-ear heart-rate monitor and (maybe) temperature sensing. Live translation is also rumored , although that may not be exclusive to the third-gen model.

Whether you want a lightweight device to binge your favorite shows, a larger screen for mobile gaming or a portable way to get some work done on the go, a tablet can do it all. They’re also great for keeping kids entertained, managing work tasks or sharing family moments through video calls. When a phone feels too small and lugging around a laptop is just too much, that’s where tablets fit into the mix. For many, the Apple iPad is the go-to choice, and it’s easy to see why with its smooth performance and endless app options. But don’t worry if iOS isn’t your thing — there are plenty of Android alternatives out there, offering the same level of flexibility without locking you into Apple’s ecosystem. Plus, if you’re on a budget, there are more affordable options that still pack a punch. Whether you’re looking for a premium tablet for work, a kid-friendly device with parental controls or just a reliable everyday companion, we’ve tested all of the big players (and many others) to find the best tablets worth your money right now. Table of contents Best tablets for 2025 Important things to consider before buying a tablet How we test tablets Other tablets we tested Tablet FAQs Tablet accessories Best tablets for 2025 Important things to consider before buying a tablet Before you start looking at specific devices, the number one thing you should do is figure out what you plan to use your new tablet for. That’s because if all you need is something to keep a kid busy, buying a brand new Apple iPad Air or iPad Pro doesn’t make a ton of sense. On the flip side, if you want to use a tablet for video editing or drawing, you’ll need to take things like performance, versatility and stylus support more seriously — especially if you're considering using it as a laptop replacement. You’ll also want to think about stuff like how often you plan on traveling with the device and if it’s more for productivity, or for less demanding stuff like web browsing or streaming shows. There’s also an important trade-off to consider when it comes to battery life as well. Larger devices tend to have longer runtimes, though an increase in size may make it less portable. How we test tablets When evaluating different tablets, there are a few important things we look for above all else: solid performance, a good screen and long battery life. For performance, we run a handful of synthetic tests like Geekbench 6, while also performing a number of hands-on, real-world use cases such as editing photos and playing games. And with tablets often serving as hybrid devices, we also consider how easy it is to multitask and switch quickly between various apps. The more responsive a device feels, the better. Because a tablet’s display is such a critical component, we also view a wide range of content to gauge things like brightness, color gamut and dynamic range. It’s important to take into account the difference between various panel types like OLED, which typically produce richer colors and excellent contrast but may not be as bright as a mini LED display. Recently, refresh rate has become an increasingly important spec as 90Hz and 120Hz screens can make scrolling smoother and graphics appear sharper in games. We also consider a tablet’s design (including things like size, weight and water resistance), its connectivity (WiFi, Bluetooth, NFC, 5G, et cetera) and special features like stylus support or the ability to serve as a secondary display. That’s because, while tablets were often viewed as content consumption devices in the past, higher-end devices like the Surface Pro and iPad Pro are more than capable of replacing a laptop for a lot of people. Finally, we test battery life by running our standard local video rundown test, which involves playing a single video on a loop from 100 percent until it runs out of juice. Ideally, a tablet should be able to last an entire working day, but longer runtimes are always welcome — especially for users relying on them for productivity, entertainment and storage options on the go. Other tablets we tested Apple iPad mini Apple updated the iPad mini for 2024 with some under-the-hood changes including a new processor and additional RAM to help support Apple Intelligence features. While the iPad mini is one of the best iPads you can buy, its small size makes it a bit niche. Only if you prefer your tablet be the size of an ereader should you consider this one. Google Pixel Tablet The Google Pixel Tablet excels as a smart display rather than a simple tablet. As the latter, it's unexciting, but when paired with its speaker/charging dock, it becomes much more useful. It could be a good option for those that already live within the Google ecosystem and use the Google Assistant often, or those who like the idea of a tablet that can be docked and used as a smart display as well. OnePlus Pad The solid OnePlus Pad is let down by Android because there aren't many Android apps designed to be used on a large display like this model's 11.6-inch panel. Otherwise, the hardware is well-designed, its companion stylus is comfortable to use and it has an excellent battery life. Tablet FAQs What is the best brand for tablets? The best brand for tablets is really the brand you feel most comfortable with. We recommend taking stock of the gadgets you already have — do you live in the Apple ecosystem already? An iPad might be best for you then. Do you have a Samsung phone? If so, a Galaxy Tab will likely be the most convenient choice. There is no one \"best brand\" for tablets; you’ll find good options made by companies including Apple, Google, Samsung, Microsoft and Amazon. Can a tablet replace a laptop? It’s possible for a tablet to replace a laptop, but you’ll need a few accessories to truly make the experience as close as possible to that of a traditional notebook. A keyboard is a must, be it a keyboard case or a Bluetooth accessory that you keep with you. Some keyboard cases, like apple’s Magic Keyboard for the iPad, have a built-in trackpad, which will be more ergonomic than tapping on your tablet’s screen for input. Additionally, you could go one step further and use a wireless mouse that connects via Bluetooth to your tablet. If you’re primarily looking for a tablet to replace your laptop, consider buying a 2-in-1 laptop since those systems typically consist of high-powered tablets that are designed to work well with (and without) keyboards. What size screen do I need? Figuring out the best screen size for you will also be related to the kind of work (or play) you intend to do. Larger screens make it much easier to view two apps side by side, and big screens also deliver a more immersive movie viewing experience — especially when paired with an OLED display or Liquid Retina display. But at the same time, the larger the tablet, the less likely you’re going to want to move it around. That means you’re not only going to want to take stock of your workspace (i.e., if you have a desk or instead plan to work from a couch or even your bed), but you’re also going to want to think about how the device will fit into your everyday routine or commute (if you have one). Tablet accessories Finally, you’ll want to consider any add-ons or accessories you’re planning to use, which can range from detachable keyboards to things like external mics or a stylus. The good news is that many of the best tablets nowadays offer some kind of keyboard accessory, which allows the device to function more like a 2-in-1 instead of simply being a content consumption device. Some tablets also feature things like microSD card slots that support expandable storage, or optional 4G or 5G connectivity, which can be a real boon to frequent travelers. And if you’re planning to use the tablet mainly for work, you might want to grab a USB hub for connecting all your favorite peripherals so your devices don’t have to fight for the charger.

(Apple) Next month, we'll finally get the option to download iOS 26 on our iPhones ( screenshots are way better in the latest operating system!). Until then, you can download and install the newly released public beta 2 (or iOS 26 developer beta 6 for developers). During Apple's recent earnings call, CEO Tim Cook said its collection of upcoming beta operating systems (including iOS) are \"by far the most popular developer betas we’ve had,\" 9to5Mac reports . You can also take a look at our preview of the iOS 26 public beta release , which shows off the fresh home and lock screen redesign. Called Liquid Glass , the new translucent look will extend across all of Apple's upcoming operating systems. The overhaul is one of several big changes coming to iOS, macOS , iPadOS and the rest of Apple's software suite, all of which were showcased during the company's WWDC keynote on June 9. After overpromising on AI plans last year, Apple kept its iOS roadmap focused more on basic quality of life improvements this year. There are multiple useful additions coming to the Phone and Messages apps on your iPhone, for instance: Apple execs outlined the ability to weed out spam texts or other unknown senders and an option to hold your spot on a phone call when you've been waiting for a representative to pick up. Plus, a treasured feature that we took for granted is coming back (hint: it's in the Photos app). Siri, meanwhile, is in a holding pattern. Apple has previously specified that its smarter voice assistant — first promised at WWDC 2024 — is delayed until some point \" in the coming year ,\" so you shouldn't expect any major changes in the current betas. But there are reports that Apple is aiming to give Siri a bigger brain transplant by basing it on third-party artificial intelligence models like OpenAI's ChatGPT or Anthropic's Claude, which could make 2026 a pivotal year. The company is also reportedly working on a 'stripped-down' AI chatbot to rival ChatGPT. With each beta, it seems like additional new improvements are popping up, like this new AirPods gesture we're all curious about, and this FaceTime feature that'll freeze your video if it detects nudity . With the release of the iOS 26 developer beta 5 , we saw more added features, like a new bouncy animation on the passcode screen and in the Control Center, MacRumors reports . Some or all of those changes will likely soon migrate into the separate public beta (see below). Most newer iPhone models are eligible to download iOS 26 (both the betas and final version). Want to see the full list of new features coming this fall? Read on. What is iOS 26? The current iPhone operating system is iOS 18, and Apple is still actively updating it — version 18.6 was just recently released. But don't expect to see iOS 19. Instead, Apple is skipping the numbering ahead to iOS 26 later this year. The company has decided to line up its iOS version numbers with a year-based system, similar to car model years. So while iOS and its sibling operating systems will be released in late 2025, they're all designated \"26\" to reflect the year ahead. It's official, we're moving to iOS 26. (Apple) What is Liquid Glass design? Let's be honest. Out of everything announced at WWDC this year, the new Liquid Glass design was the star of the show. The iPhone's home and lock screens have looked pretty much the same year after year — the last exciting thing (in my opinion) was the option to add your own aesthetic to your home screen by customizing your apps and widgets. So seeing the home and lock screens' new facelift is refreshing. So what exactly is Liquid Glass? Apple calls it a \" new translucent material \" since, well, the apps and widgets are clear. However, the screen can still adapt to dark and light modes, depending on surroundings. You'll also notice buttons with a new floating design in several apps, like Phone and Maps. They're designed to be less distracting than the current buttons, but are still easy to see. While the design overhaul has proven to be controversial since its announcement, some — including Engadget's own Devindra Hardawar — like the new direction, even if it's somewhat reminiscent of Microsoft's translucent Windows Vista Aero designs from nearly twenty years ago. That said, as of the release of the iOS 26 beta 2, Apple has already incorporated some user feedback into the design, dialing back the transparency in at least some places. And while it will continue to evolve, Apple users won't be able to escape it: Liquid Glass was designed to make all of Apple's OSes more cohesive. Here's a look at how the translucent aesthetic will look with the new macOS Tahoe 26 on your desktop. What are the new and notable features of iOS 26? iOS 26 has a laundry list of new features. Among the most worthwhile: Phone app redesign: You'll finally be able to scroll through contacts, recent calls and voicemail messages all on one screen. It also comes with a new feature called Hold Assist that'll notify you when an agent comes to the phone so you can avoid the elevator music and continue on with other tasks. Live Translation in Phone, FaceTime and Messages: iOS 26 is bringing the ability to have a conversation via phone call or text message with someone who speaks another language. Live Translation will translate your conversation in real time, which results in some stop-and-go interactions in the examples Apple shared during its presentation. Polls in group chats: Tired of sorting through what seems like hundreds of messages in your group chat? You and your friends will soon be able to create polls in group messages for deciding things like which brunch spot you're eating at or whose car you're taking on a road trip. Filtering unknown senders in Messages: If you haven't received spam texts about unpaid tolls or other citations, you're lucky. For those of us who have, those annoying messages will soon be filtered away in a separate folder. Visual Intelligence: Similar to a reverse Google image search, this new feature will allow you to search for anything that's on your iPhone screen. For instance, if you spot a pair of shoes someone is wearing in an Instagram photo, you can screenshot it and use Visual Intelligence to find those shoes (or similar ones) online. Photos tabs are back: For anyone who's still frustrated with the Photos changes made last year , you'll be happy to know that your tabs are coming back. Library and Collections will have their own separate spaces so you don't have to scroll to infinity to find what you're looking for. FaceTime \"Communication Safety\" feature: A newer addition to iOS 26 appears to be the FaceTime \"Communication Safety\" feature that pauses communications if and when nudity is detected. The feature appears to be a child safety feature that uses on-device detection, thus obviating any cloud-based privacy issues. New lock screen options : The iPhone lock screen gets more customizable in iOS 26, with a cooler clock, 3D wallpaper effects, more widgets and better focus mode options. Apple's Hold Assist will be nifty for those pesky services that put you on hold for 10 or more minutes. (Apple) New changes coming to iPadOS 26 Your iPad isn't getting left behind when it comes to big updates. Here's what's coming this fall. Multitasking and real windowing: When you download the newest update, you'll be able to have multiple apps running on your screen at the same time. Once you open an app, it'll appear on your screen as normal but you'll be able to resize and move it across your screen to make room for other apps. This feature is optional so you can turn it off if you don't like it. Visual update: Along with the other new OSes, iPadOS 26 is coming with the Liquid Glass aesthetic. This new look will appear on the lock and home screens, as well as the drop-down menus. New menu bar: When you swipe down on your screen, the new menu bar will appear with options like File, Edit, Windows and more. There's also a search option if you're looking for something specific. Check out our first impressions of iPadOS 26 . What about AirPods? AirPods are also getting updated with iOS 26. Here are some of the more notable functions. Enhanced audio recording: Apple calls this \"studio-quality\" audio recording, and with it, you'll notice more clarity while in noisy environments. Camera remote control: Using this, you can take a photo or start and stop video recording with just one press on your AirPods. When taking photos, you'll get a three-second countdown before your iPhone or iPad snaps the picture. Live translation feature: While not officially announced or confirmed, it appears that the long-rumored live translation for AirPods could be coming with iOS 26 . The evidence comes from a system asset spotted in the in iOS 26 beta showing a gesture that's triggered by pressing both earbud stems at the same time. The photo also shows words in several different languages. Which iPhones will be able to upgrade to iOS 26? A few iPhone models that run the current version of iOS — iPhone XR, XS and XS Max — won't be compatible with the latest upgrade. But any iPhones released in 2019 or later will be eligible for the iOS 26 update . iPhone SE (second generation or later) iPhone 11 iPhone 11 Pro iPhone 11 Pro Max iPhone 12 iPhone 12 mini iPhone 12 Pro iPhone 12 Pro Max iPhone 13 iPhone 13 mini iPhone 13 Pro iPhone 13 Pro Max iPhone 14 iPhone 14 Plus iPhone 14 Pro iPhone 14 Pro Max iPhone 15 iPhone 15 Plus iPhone 15 Pro iPhone 15 Pro Max iPhone 16 iPhone 16 Plus iPhone 16 Pro iPhone 16 Pro Max iPhone 16e Not listed here are the presumed new iPhone 17 models (or maybe iPhone 26?) that are all but certain to be announced and released in September. How to install iOS 26 beta The iOS 26 public beta is now available to download via the Apple Beta Software Program . If you're not already a member, you'll need to sign up to try out all the latest features. Just visit beta.apple.com and sign up with your phone number or email address. It's free. Once you're in, you can install it by going to Settings > General > Software Update and selecting iOS 26 public beta . A word of caution: Don't sign up with your main iPhone unless you're OK with any risks that occur with using an OS that isn't finalized. When will the final version of iOS 26 be released? iOS 26 will be released to the public this fall. It usually comes in September, within a week of the Apple iPhone event. Last year, it rolled out to iPhone users on September 16 — exactly one week after the iPhone 16 lineup was announced. If you're more interested in the Apple Intelligence features coming, here's everything Apple revealed for iOS, macOS and more during WWDC.

The new models will come equipped with the latest iOS 26 features preinstalled, along with whatever additional features Apple reveals at the launch event. But since we still have to wait a few weeks (presumably) until the iPhone event, we can at least speculate what the new phones will look like. As with most unreleased iPhone models, rumors and leaks have trickled in about the hardware side ahead of the official introduction. Here's what we're expecting and what we can reasonably assume we'll get from Cupertino in September. How much will the iPhone 17 cost? Apple's announced plan to expand US-based manufacturing partners seems to give it at least some shielding from the steepest Trump administration tariffs that have already triggered price increases on everything from Switch consoles to high-end cameras to Sonos speakers . But given that President Trump's trade policies can change from week to week, and Apple's continuing reliance on Asia-based supply chains, price shocks remain an ongoing possibility. The bigger question is: Will Apple absorb any higher costs, or pass them on to consumers? If prices do creep up, Apple may choose to pair it with an \"upgrade.\" Consider this recent rumor posted by MacRumors from a leaker known as \" Instant Digital ,\" suggesting that the default storage of the iPhone 17 line may start at 256GB, doubling the current 128GB baseline. While that could be accompanied by a price increase of $50 , Apple could at least pitch it as a \"better value.\" That said, the company doubled the default RAM of its Mac computers from 8GB to 16GB at no extra cost in 2024 — but that was before the current Trump tariff cycle started. When will the iPhone 17 series be announced? Most years, the flagship smartphones are introduced in September. MacRumors highlighted a story originally reported by iphone-ticker.de that the Apple iPhone 17 event could be Tuesday, September 9, according to information gleaned from German mobile phone providers. It's still too early to have the specific dates; some years, Apple only gives a week or two of lead time between sending invites and hosting the event. But years of past precedent show that sometime in September should be when the 17 models make their debut. This family of smartphones may be the last to follow that trend, however. There have been hints that the introduction of the iPhone 18 collection in 2026 will be split into a pro-tier announcement in the fall and a standard model announcement the following spring. What will the new iPhone 17 lineup include? Design leaks suggest that Apple is building an ultra-thin smartphone , likely to be named the iPhone 17 Air to match Apple's ultralight laptop designation. Bloomberg 's Mark Gurman, often a solid source of advanced intel about Apple, reported in January that the iPhone 17 Air will be equipped with a basic A19 chip and will only have a single camera lens. It may also use Apple's new in-house modem, which was introduced in February on the iPhone 16e . More details about this development may leak ahead of September, but that's what we know for now. An investor note from Apple analyst Jeff Pu indicated that the Air will have a titanium frame. If his reports are accurate, the lightweight smartphone will be the only entry in the iPhone 17 lineup to use that metal; the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max are expected to be made of aluminum, which is oddly a lighter material than titanium. Other speculation had suggested that the Air would use a blend of aluminum and titanium, so the exact materials may not be known until the official announcement. Additionally, an August 4 MacRumors report says the internal battery pack of the iPhone Air is just 2.49mm thick — half the thickness of the iPhone 17 Pro battery. The leak was posted on the Korean-language Naver blog , where they show the alleged batteries of the iPhone 17 Air and 17 Pro side by side. The same account claimed the 17 Air's battery capacity was a mere 2,800 mAh, MacRumors notes. (That's below the battery capacity of current iPhone 16 models.) A recent rumor from Majin Bu, whom MacRumors classifies as a \"hit-or-miss leaker,\" suggests the iPhone 17 Pro will have better wireless signal strength thanks to an updated antenna design. The individual posted a render on X that shows a new antenna system that wraps around the iPhone 17 Pro's supposedly wider rear camera bump. Again, this is a render, not a real-world photo. That said, we can't knock the goal of better wireless reception, so we're hoping this one has a degree of truth to it. Each new roster includes a base model, but over the years, Apple has shaken up the variety of phones it offers. Most likely there will be an iPhone 17 and an iPhone 17 Pro. Apple has also committed to the size matters philosophy, and has been building an iPhone Pro Max option with an even bigger screen and better battery life; the 17 roster will almost certainly have one as well. The new Pro iPhones are said to have a full-width \"camera island\" on the rear, which would mark the first time an Apple model opted for that design. This feature can be seen in the purported iPhone 17 \"spotted in the wild.\" The pics, highlighted on MacRumors , show a black cased iPhone (17 Pro?) with the distinct back panel. Is it the real deal? The dual angles lend a degree of credibility in a social media landscape increasingly polluted with AI-enhanced fakes, but your guess is as good as ours. I just spotted a test development iPhone in the wild 🤩🤩🤩 pic.twitter.com/iS3PtKWqxJ — Fox Pupy 🦊🧡 (@Skyfops) July 28, 2025 The iPhone 17 Air seems primed to take the place of a potential iPhone 17 Plus. Since the iPhone 16e was only just introduced in February at a surprisingly high price point , it seems unlikely that there will be a new addition to that lower end of the spectrum, the models that were previously called SE. At the very least, it sounds like the iPhone 17 Air won't take away the charging port and rely only on wireless connectivity. Bloomberg said that while Apple had investigated making the iPhone 17 Air without a single port, the company (fortunately) changed plans. He also says that the rumored phone will have a 6.6-inch screen and include the Dynamic Island and Camera Control button. Finally, the price is rumored at $900 — likely more than the standard iPhone 17 but less than the Pro. We've also gotten what seems to be a reliable look at what the color lineup will be for the new smartphones. Macworld reported that the iPhone 17 will be available in black, white, steel gray, green, purple and light blue. The iPhone 17 Air will reportedly have four color options: black, white, light blue and light gold. While the Air colors will be less saturated, the visuals for the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max will go bold. The options for the Pro models are expected to be black, white, gray, dark blue and orange. On July 30, Tom's Guide highlighted an X post from Sonny Dickson — a longtime and generally reliable leaker of unreleased iPhone information — showing \"dummy\" iPhone 17 models in the new colors that were the source of the aforementioned Macworld story. While these are literally just mock-ups — not real, leaked iPhones — it's interesting to see how the design and color rumors translate into a real-world look and feel. What will iOS 26 be like? Apple upended its numbering conventions with WWDC 2025, and will match the name of each new operating system to the year it's released. So when the next wave of iPhones hits, they'll be running on iOS 26 . On the design side, the smartphone OS introduced during the big developer showcase took a contentious approach dubbed Liquid Glass. Apple has been scaling down the amount of transparency effects in the subsequent beta tests of iOS 26, but it will still have a glass-like visual. The feature list includes big and small updates. On the more impactful side, the Phone and Photos apps have been redesigned. There will be several features leveraging artificial intelligence, such as live translation capabilities coming to Phone, FaceTime and Messages. Apple is also currently testing a sensitive content warning for child accounts that will freeze FaceTime video if nudity is detected by on-device machine learning tools. And the company is also launching Visual Intelligence, which will use AI to search for elements in an image. iOS 26 also has a litany of minor, quality of life improvements. Group texts are getting support for polls. And for the slow risers out there, iOS 26 will finally let you escape the tyranny of the nine minute snooze alarm . The next iOS is now available as a public beta . Here are our initial impressions of the Liquid Glass design and other new features. iOS 26 is compatible with all models back through iPhone 11. What other products are expected to be released alongside the iPhone 17? If Apple follows its usual pattern, the iPhone 17 will be announced alongside new Apple Watch products. That would be the Apple Watch Series 11 (if Apple sticks to the same naming scheme), and maybe an Apple Watch Ultra 3 and/or an updated Apple Watch SE. (They'll all run watchOS 26 , of course.) Other possibilities — and this is, again, speculation — could include refreshed Apple AirPods Pro (which received its last big update in 2022 ) and maybe new AirTags trackers (first released in 2021). But knowing Apple doesn't like to take the spotlight off its star performer — the iPhone — those accessories could come sometime later in the year (if they appear this year at all). The same goes for rumored refreshes of the Apple TV and HomePod mini , which are also getting long in the tooth. Don't expect any Macs or iPads, however. Apple has recently been holding computer updates for late October (as it did last year with the new M4 Macs ). Update, August, 13, 2025, 10:02PM ET: Added a list of the products that are expected to be released alongside the iPhone 17s. Update, August 11, 2025, 7:27PM ET: Added a render of a rumored new antenna design for the iPhone 17 Pro. Update, August 8, 2025, 4:43PM ET: Added new speculation and reports about iPhone 17 pricing.

A pretty cool option available on both is the visual update, called Liquid Glass — it's like the better-executed version of Windows Vista . We spent two weeks test-driving it — you can check out our detailed hands-on iOS 26 preview , or you can try it out yourself by downloading and installing the public beta 2 . That software is a more stable iteration of the separate developer version, which recently hit the beta 6 waypoint, and offers a few more flashy features not yet available in the public version. (While the public beta is open to everyone and quite stable, always remember there's a degree of risk involved with beta software.) Additionally, there are credible reports that iOS 26 could bring a new live translation feature to AirPods , too. Not ready to upgrade your smartphone or tablet this year? No worries, we'll help you find out if your devices will be able to run iOS 26. While Apple didn't nix any iPhones from its eligibility list last year, that's not the case for 2025 — a few models are getting cut this time. All iPhone 8 models and the iPhone X were the last to get the boot in 2023, and this year the 2018 models are getting left behind. If you have an ineligible device, you won't be able to download iOS 26 when it becomes available this fall. We'll get to the bottom of which iPhones and iPads will support iOS 26 and iPadOS 26 this year. To see what's coming with the latest OSes, check out everything announced at Apple's WWDC June 9 event . One thing you shouldn't immediately expect is Apple's updated version of Siri , though the company is reportedly working on a 'stripped-down' AI chatbot to compete with ChatGPT. These three iPhones won't be compatible with iOS 26 Unlike last year, several iPhone models won't be eligible to download the newest iOS when it makes its debut this fall. This trio of models first released in 2018 won't be coming to the iOS 26 party: iPhone XR iPhone XS iPhone XS Max iPhones compatible with iOS 26 While we don't yet know the new iPhones Apple will be dropping this fall — though there are iPhone 17 rumors — we do know, per Apple's site , that the phones listed below will be compatible with iOS 26. Basically, if you have an iPhone that was announced in 2019 or later, you're in the clear: iPhone SE (second generation or later) iPhone 11 iPhone 11 Pro iPhone 11 Pro Max iPhone 12 iPhone 12 mini iPhone 12 Pro iPhone 12 Pro Max iPhone 13 iPhone 13 mini iPhone 13 Pro iPhone 13 Pro Max iPhone 14 iPhone 14 Plus iPhone 14 Pro iPhone 14 Pro Max iPhone 15 iPhone 15 Plus iPhone 15 Pro iPhone 15 Pro Max iPhone 16 iPhone 16 Plus iPhone 16 Pro iPhone 16 Pro Max iPhone 16e iPads compatible with iPadOS 26 The iPads listed below, and any iPads released later this year, are eligible to download iPadOS 26 . iPad Pro (M4) iPad Pro 12.9‑inch (3rd generation and later) iPad Pro 11‑inch (1st generation and later) iPad Air (3rd generation and later, including M2 and M3) iPad (8th generation and later, including A16) iPad mini (5th generation and later, including A17 Pro) What if I don't want to buy a new iPhone? If you want to continue using your older iPhone that isn't supported by iOS 26, that's fine. However, you'll miss out on security updates which could potentially put your phone at risk for malware and other threats. Additionally, some apps may stop working if they require a certain version of iOS or later. And of course, you won't be able to access the latest features iOS 26 offers. When will iOS 26 become available? Apple usually rolls out its latest iOS in mid-September, just a few days before the new iPhones hit store shelves. Last year, it released iOS 18 on Monday, Sept. 16. Expect a confirmation of the release date at the iPhone 17 event, expected in early September. iOS 26 features we're excited about Liquid Glass design : Your home screen is getting revamped with new app icons, including dark mode and all-clear options. You'll also notice buttons with a new floating design. Liquid Glass was designed to make all of Apple's OSes more cohesive. Phone app redesign: You'll finally be able to scroll through contacts, recent calls and voicemail messages all on one screen. It also comes with a new feature called Hold Assist that'll notify you when an agent comes to the phone so you can avoid the elevator music. Live Translate: iOS 26 is bringing the ability to have a conversation via phone call or text message with someone who speaks another language. Live Translate will translate your conversation in real time. Polls feature: Coming to group messages in the Messages app, chat members will be able to create polls. This can help prevent the unwanted 30+ messages when it comes to deciding which restaurant you're meeting at this weekend.

The latest missive from Mark Gurman at Bloomberg suggests that Apple is shifting its artificial intelligence goals to center on new device segments. Sources reportedly told the publication that Apple has a slate of new smart home products in the works that could help pivot its lagging AI strategy. The center of the new lineup is a tabletop AI companion that has been described as an iPad on a movable robotic arm. It would be able to swivel to face the screen toward a user as they move around their home or office. Sources said the current prototype uses a horizontal display that's about seven inches while the motorized arm can move the screen about six inches away from the base in any direction. Equipped with a long-promised overhaul to the Siri voice assistant, this device could act like an additional person, recalling information, making suggestions and participating in conversations. According to Bloomberg , Apple is targeting a 2027 release for this product. Apple's new lineup is also rumored to include a smart home hub that is a simpler version of the robotic friend with no moving stand. We might be seeing this sooner, with a projected 2026 release for the device. This hub device would be able to control music playback, take notes, browse the web and host videoconferencing. Both the robot companion and the smart home hub are reportedly running a new operating system called Charismatic that's designed to support multiple users. The Siri running on the device will be given a particularly cheery personality, and it may also be getting a visual representation. Bloomberg 's sources said there hasn't been a final decision on aesthetics; internal tests have had Siri looking like an animated Finder icon and like a Memoji. Today's scuttlebutt follows on previous reports from Gurman that pointed to Apple's interest in these categories. The idea of a smart home hub was apparently floated at the company as far back as 2022, and it's finally being rumored to have a formal debut some time this year. Robots have also been a topic of interest in Cupertino for some time, with claims that Apple was developing a personal robot dating back at least to last spring . While this Bloomberg piece offers more detail about those hypothetical plans, there's always a chance Apple will change direction or scrap a project.

But for some, credit isn’t about luxuries – it’s about getting by.5% (2.8 million) had persistent credit card debt, meaning they paid more in interest and charges than they paid off.21% (11.4 million) had been overdrawn at some point in the past year.Of those with personal loans, 10% - equivalent to around 1.6 million UK adults - used them to cover everyday expenses like food, travel, or rent.These figures show how deeply embedded credit is in daily life – and the complexities involved when it becomes a lifeline rather than a tool.What we’ve learnedOver the years, we’ve listened to consumers, firms, and community organisations. Three key lessons stand out:Credit isn’t always the answer. For some, the right support might be getting help with managing your money, checking benefits or finding work - not another loan. Signposting consumers to help is an appropriate outcome - which also aligns with the Consumer Duty.Technology has transformed the sector – especially when it comes to spotting harm. Digital tools may have made credit more accessible, but it can also be used to spot early signs of financial difficulty. We recently echoed this in our call for improvements to digital loan processes, highlighting the need for fairer, more transparent online journeys.The best results happen when we work together - and that means traditional banks, fintechs, community lenders and mutuals, and the rest of the commercial sector. Take our 2024 Financial Inclusion Tech Sprint, where one of the winning collaborations between community lender Moneyline and fintech Inbest.ai developed a signposting toolkit for customers declined for credit. The tool offers tailored referrals to debt advice, income maximisation resources, and social tariffs – and in some cases, provides small crisis grants to those most in need. It’s a powerful example of how innovation and partnership can deliver meaningful support beyond credit.How did we get here?We took over responsibility for consumer credit in 2014. Since then, we’ve concentrated on raising standards. We introduced the high-cost-short-term-credit price cap, which has benefitted 760,000 customers, saving them £150m annually. We strengthened support for borrowers in difficulty and acted against firms not getting it right. Both the Senior Managers & Certification Regime and the Consumer Duty have also built a strong foundation for a fairer, more resilient and more innovative consumer credit sector all round.Some firms have thrived adapting to these reforms. Others ended up leaving the market -particularly high-cost credit firms. While this has reduced harmful practices, it’s also made access to credit more difficult for some, highlighting the complexity of consumer needs.What’s the plan for consumer credit over the next decade?If the last decade was about raising standards, the next must be about forging a better outlook.This is tied to our mission in our 5-year strategy of supporting growth and helping consumers navigate their financial lives. Because a healthy, innovative consumer credit sector can protect consumers and help them – and firms – to thrive.Three priorities will guide our work:Innovation that adds real value. The best financial products are intuitive, transparent and genuinely useful. Simplicity unlocks confidence and economic activity.Vulnerable customers getting compassionate support. This is non-negotiable. Any one of us can face hardship. The difference between recovery and crisis often lies in how firms respond.People need credit that’s both accessible and right for them. Getting that balance right between access and protection is essential – not just for individuals, but the whole economy. We’re playing an active role in the Government’s Financial Inclusion Committee, helping to shape policies that promote fair access to affordable credit and financial services – particularly for those most at risk of being turned down and left out.There’s no single solution. But by working together – regulators, firms and communities – we can nurture a system that supports consumers at each stage of their financial lives.We invite all firms to be part of this conversation and the solutions it inspires. Together, we can shape a fairer, more resilient financial future.", "ingested_utc": "2025-08-14T16:32:28Z", "retrieved_utc": "2025-08-14T16:32:28Z"}

The slogan “black is beautiful” rang out from civil rights marches in the US and UK during the 1960s and echoed through liberation struggles across the global south. It became a rallying cry against racist beauty standards that had long cast Black skin, facial features and hair as undesirable. These movements urged pride in what had been denigrated for centuries, and their message was not limited to people of African or Caribbean heritage. Calls to embrace natural beauty resonated across Asia and much of the global south, directly challenging the colonial belief that lighter skin conferred greater worth.

Further details are provided on the relevant webpages of the calculations. Bonds quarterly liquidity assessment ESMA has published the latest quarterly liquidity assessment for bonds available for trading on EU trading venues. For this period, there are currently 1,346 liquid bonds subject to MiFID II transparency requirements. ESMA’s liquidity assessment for bonds is based on a quarterly assessment of quantitative liquidity criteria, which includes the daily average trading activity (trades and notional amount) and the percentage of days traded per quarter. ESMA updates the bond market liquidity assessments quarterly. However, additional data and corrections submitted to ESMA may result in further updates within each quarter, published in ESMA’s Financial Instruments Transparency System (FITRS) , which shall be applicable the day following publication . The full list of assessed bonds is now available through FITRS in the XML files with publication date from 1 August 2025 ( see here ) and through the Register web interface ( see here ). ESMA also publishes two completeness indicators related to bond liquidity data. The transparency requirements for bonds deemed liquid today will apply from 18 August to 16 November 202 5.

The new VCM limits at 7% the trading volume under the reference price waiver in the EU, compared to the total aggregated trading volume in the EU over the last 12 months for each equity and equity-like financial instrument. If the limit is exceeded, trading venues will need to suspend the use of the waiver for the concerned instrument for a period of three months. Trading venues must base their decision to suspend the waiver use on the data published by ESMA under the dedicated VCM webpage. Technical reporting changes To reduce reporting burden of entities, the future VCM calculations will be based on transaction reporting data collected by National Competent Authorities (NCAs). Therefore, the DVCM reporting system will be decommissioned in January 2026. To reflect these changes, ESMA has submitted for adoption the amendment to the Regulatory Technical Standard 3 (RTS 3). Even in case the RTS 3 revision is not yet in place at that moment, the VCM switch will occur at the announced date. ESMA is currently preparing the new VCM data system. For more details about the formats and templates, please consult the dedicated VCM webpage. Next steps ESMA encourages all interested parties to prepare for the change in requirements in line with the new VCM becoming active in Q4 2025. The first publication of the calculation results is expected for 9 October 2025.

Moreover, the thematic notes outline four guiding principles on making sustainability claims used in non-regulatory communications. It also offers practical do’s and don’ts, illustrated through concrete examples of good and poor practices, based on observed market practices. In the course of 2023 and 2024, ESMA, together with the National Competent Authorities (NCAs), carried out the Common Supervisory Action (CSA) on the integration of sustainability risks and disclosures in the investment management sector. The level of compliance with the framework on the integration of sustainability risks and disclosures is overall satisfactory, but there remain opportunities for improvement.

The list also includes trading venues that can choose to transmit data to the equity CTP and opt-in to the mandatory data contribution regime. As specified in the Market in Financial Instruments Regulation (MiFIR) the trading venues opting-in will need to contribute data to the CTP within 30 days from the notification to ESMA. ESMA will immediately update the list once a trading venue starts or ends operations and when a trading venue decides to voluntary opt-in. Next steps The entities that decide to opt-in will communicate their decision to ESMA, at the following email address: secondary-markets@esma.europa.eu . Additionally, they will notify to their National Competent Authority (NCA). The next publication of the list will be in January 2026. Background According to MiFIR, ESMA must publish on its website and keep up to date a list identifying: investment firms operating small and medium enterprises (SME) growth markets and market operators that are mandated to contribute data to the CTP, investment firms that are not obliged to contribute but can opt-in to the mandatory regime, and investment firms that decided to opt-in.

The peer review analyses the approaches adopted by the Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA) in the authorisation and early supervision of a CASP and provides recommendations to strengthen these processes. It identifies overall a good level of resources and supervisory engagement within the authority, with some areas for improvement related to the assessment of authorisations. Key findings: Some material issues where not fully resolved when MFSA granted the CASP authorisation; Some risks areas were not adequately assessed during the authorisation process; The MFSA has demonstrated a good level of expertise and supervisory cooperation. The peer review also recommends to all NCAs currently in the process of authorising CASPs to pay particular attention to certain areas of risk, including business growth, conflicts of interests, governance and intragroup arrangements, ICT architecture, Web3, decentralised products, and the promotion of unregulated services. While focused on an individual case, the review aims to foster the sound authorisation of CASPs by all NCAs in the EU. Its conclusions should be on-boarded by all NCAs to ensure that the authorisations they grant are well assessed in this new and high-risk sector, where supervisory knowledge is still being built. This exercise is also an opportunity to reinforce EU supervisors’ role as gatekeepers of the EU single market in the crypto space. Next steps The objective of peer reviews is to enhance convergence and harmonisation in the process across the EU, and the NCAs are expected to integrate the recommendations in their internal processes, as well as in their on-going and future authorisations. ESMA will continue promoting further discussion on the recommendations and cross border cooperation.

Under this plan, and in line with the Paris Agreement, ESMA commits to reducing its gross greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 15.4% in 2027 and 31.4% in 2030, compared to 2023. Through the implementation of the Climate Transition Plan, ESMA aims to reduce the carbon footprint of its operations, particularly in relation to staff business travel, energy use, and food consumption. In the short term, progress towards this goal will be achieved through: introduction of an annual GHG budget to manage emissions from air travel, optimising floor occupancy during certain periods of the year to reduce energy consumption, and implementing incentives to shift to lower-carbon practices in the purchase of goods and services. This first plan has been put in place with the data currently available. It will be regularly reviewed, adapted, and improved. Next steps ESMA will implement decarbonisation levers and measures identified under this Climate Transition Plan and will report on the progress achieved annually, via its Annual Report and its Environmental Statement.

The activities of these firms are vital for the financial health and growth of the UK economy.Therefore, making sure these firms are resilient and financially stable ensures they provide consumers and businesses with the services they need – in both good times and bad.Non-banks use leverage (borrowing to invest) to increase exposure, boost returns or hedge potential losses. This can be achieved in various ways, ranging from taking out loans to using complex derivatives. The use of leverage is an essential component of the deep and efficient capital markets that we have in the UK.In good times, this leverage provides extra liquidity to the system and helps maximise returns. But in periods of market stress, leverage that is poorly managed, concentrated, or hard to spot can raise instability. This is particularly true in markets that are core to the functioning of the real economy. For example, UK government debt markets, or when highly leveraged non-banks risk transferring stress to institutions like banks, which are central to the stability of the financial system.As the regulator, our role is to ensure that markets work well. Leverage is not inherently a cause for concern. But to ensure that leverage can continue to play its part in supporting the UK economy in good times and bad, we need to find ways to identify and address systemic risks - without impeding market efficiency or disproportionately burdening firms.FSB recommendationsTwo years ago, I took up a role as co-chair of the Financial Stability Board's (FSB’s) working group on non-bank leverage. This group recently published policy recommendations (PDF) seeking to identify and address financial stability risks created by non-bank leverage.Effective risk management depends on having the right information at the right time. Without it, both market participants and regulators are essentially flying blind. The report addresses this fundamental challenge by recommending stronger risk monitoring and greater market transparency.The proposed measures put forward by the FSB focus on improving how firms share critical information – both publicly and with their trading partners. These measures should give firms better insight into their own exposures and broader market conditions, helping them manage investment risks more effectively. The improvements should also provide authorities with a comprehensive view of the entire system. Having this birds-eye view enables authorities to spot risks that individual firms might not see – such as dangerous concentrations of investments or overcrowded market positions.The FSB report also provides policy options for authorities to consider once they address risks to financial stability. Given the complex and diverse nature of the non-bank sector, there's no one-size-fits-all approach – so the report sets out a number of different alternatives that authorities may wish to consider. This approach is a good one - what matters is that all jurisdictions have sufficient measures to manage systemic risk, even if different authorities choose a different set of policy tools or measures to do so.What's next for the UK?We are already working to become a smarter regulator, and we're focusing on how we collect and use data to spot risks early.To do our job, which is to make sure that markets function well, we know we need data that provides the practical insights we need to make effective, proportionate decisions.The FSB recommendations are well timed for us. We are already taking steps to evaluate what data we need and switching off regulatory reporting returns that are no longer relevant. There is an ongoing programme of work looking at our data needs – and we’ll think carefully about which risk metrics are most useful for us going forward, including how we can align with other jurisdictions.Working with our international partnersAs much of the non-bank sector operates across borders, it’s crucial that we also collaborate with our international counterparts to spot risks and potential spillovers effectively.This means engaging bilaterally on issues like information sharing and risk monitoring, while continuing to take an active role in international standard-setting bodies. In this way, we can strive for internationally consistent outcomes and be confident that we’re safeguarding the system, while still ensuring that the UK remains competitive.My time leading this FSB working group has highlighted that non-bank leverage is a particularly tricky issue to tackle, demanding in-depth knowledge, industry perspective, and extensive international cooperation. The publication of the FSB’s recommendations is a major step forward in this space – and I’m proud that the FCA has been able to play such a leading role in advancing this work.", "ingested_utc": "2025-08-14T06:45:04Z", "retrieved_utc": "2025-08-14T06:45:04Z"}

Separately, there will be a competitive layer of open banking schemes, which operate commercially. We expect these schemes to utilise the common API standards developed and overseen by the Future Entity, but they may innovate above these standards to provide premium services. APIs allow different firms’ software applications to communicate and interact with each other, exchanging data quickly and securely.

The FCA has decided to fine Mr Woodford £5,888,800 and ban him from holding senior manager roles and managing funds for retail investors.The FCA has also decided to fine WIM £40,000,000.WEIF was an investment fund managed by Mr Woodford and WIM. They were responsible for managing the liquidity of the fund, so that investors could redeem their investments and be repaid.The fund was suspended in June 2019, leaving investors – a significant majority of whom were ordinary retail customers – unable to access their money. The value of the WEIF had fallen from a high of over £10.1bn in May 2017 to just £3.6bn in the run-up to its suspension.The FCA has concluded that between July 2018 and June 2019 WIM and Mr Woodford made unreasonable and inappropriate investment decisions. They disproportionately sold more liquid investments (those that are easier to sell) and bought less liquid ones over this period. This meant that at the time of suspension only 8% of the investments held by WEIF could be sold within 7 days. Under rules in place at the time, investors should have been able to access their funds within 4 days.WIM and Mr Woodford did not react appropriately as the fund’s value declined, its liquidity worsened and more investors withdrew their money. This disadvantaged investors who remained in the fund, compared to those who had withdrawn their investment before the fund was suspended.The FCA has concluded that Mr Woodford held a defective and unreasonably narrow understanding of his responsibilities. Despite his senior role, he did not accept that he had a responsibility to oversee the management of the fund’s liquidity, including in interviews conducted by the FCA. He also failed to provide proper oversight of WIM’s relationship with Link Fund Solutions (Link), the WEIF’s authorised corporate director, including after Link raised concerns about the fund’s liquidity.The FCA considers Mr Woodford’s and WIM’s failings led to a significantly increased risk of the fund being suspended.Steve Smart, joint executive director of enforcement and market oversight at the FCA, said:'Being a leader in financial services comes with responsibilities as well as profile. Mr Woodford simply doesn’t accept he had any role in managing the liquidity of the fund. The very minimum investors should expect is those managing their money make sensible decisions and take their senior role seriously. Neither Neil Woodford nor Woodford Investment Management did so, putting at risk the money people had entrusted them with.’The FCA previously set out its findings against Link for its role in the suspension of the WEIF.

Many motor finance firms were not complying with rules or the law by not providing customers with relevant information about commission paid by lenders to the car dealers who sold the loans.The FCA has moved quickly on steps to set up a proposed compensation scheme because it wants to provide clarity and certainty to consumers, firms and investors as quickly as possible.It also wants to ensure the integrity of the motor finance market so it works well for consumers now and in the future. The compensation scheme would balance principles including fairness, timeliness, and certainty.Nikhil Rathi, chief executive of the FCA, said:'It is clear that some firms have broken the law and our rules. It’s fair for their customers to be compensated. We also want to ensure that the market, relied on by millions each year, can continue to work well and consumers can get a fair deal.'Our aim is a compensation scheme that’s fair and easy to participate in, so there’s no need to use a claims management company or law firm. If you do, it will cost you a significant chunk of any money you get.'It will take time to establish a scheme but we hope to start getting people any money they are owed next year.'The announcement follows Friday’s landmark ruling by the Supreme Court, on cases in which the FCA had intervened. While some motor finance customers won’t get compensation because in many cases commission payments were legal, the Court ruled that in certain circumstances the failure to properly disclose commission arrangements could be unfair and therefore unlawful.The FCA will propose rules on how lenders should consistently, efficiently and fairly decide whether someone is owed compensation and how much. It will monitor if firms are following the rules and act if they’re not.The FCA currently estimates that most individuals will probably receive less than £950 in compensation per agreement.The final total cost of any compensation scheme will depend on the final design. That makes it hard to estimate precisely. Any estimates are only indicative at this stage and may change. The FCA thinks it unlikely the cost of the scheme, including to run it, would be much lower than £9 billion. And it could be higher, up to £18 billion in some scenarios though the FCA doesn’t believe these are the most likely. A total cost midway in the range, as forecast by some analysts, is more plausible.The consultation will launch by early October. If the compensation scheme goes ahead, the first payments should be made in 2026.People who have already complained don’t need to do anything. Consumers who are concerned that they were not told about commission and think they may have paid too much for their motor finance should complain now. Consumers do not need to use a claims management company or law firm and doing so could cost them around 30% of any compensation paid.The FCA recognises that consumers want to receive any compensation owed quickly and firms and investors want certainty. The regulator will be working intensively and engaging widely over the coming weeks on the detail of how a scheme would work.Notes to editors The full market statement: FCA to consult on a compensation scheme for motor finance customersThe Supreme Court judgment", "ingested_utc": "2025-08-14T06:45:04Z", "retrieved_utc": "2025-08-14T06:45:04Z"}

Any redress scheme must be fair to consumers who have lost out and ensure the integrity of the motor finance market, so it works well for future consumers.We will publish the consultation by early October and finalise any scheme in time for people to start receiving compensation next year.Why are we proposing a redress scheme?Our detailed review of the past use of motor finance has shown that many firms were not complying with the law or our disclosure rules that were in force when they sold loans to consumers. Where consumers have lost out, they should be appropriately compensated in an orderly, consistent and efficient way.Some consumers have challenged their agreements with lenders through the courts. On Friday the Supreme Court ruled that in many cases commission payments could be legal, but a lender did act unfairly – and therefore unlawfully - due in part to the size of the commission it paid to the motor dealer and how it was disclosed.The Supreme Court agreed with several factors we had identified which could point towards an unfair relationship and fall foul of the Consumer Credit Act (CCA), whilst recognising it depends on the facts of each case.Such factors could include:the size of the commission relative to the charge for creditthe nature of the commission, for example, whether it is discretionarythe characteristics of the consumercompliance with regulatory rulesthe extent and manner of disclosureThis clarity helps us because we have been looking at what is unfair and, prior to this judgment, there were different interpretations of the law coming from different courts.We will now consult on a redress scheme. Redress would depend on non-disclosure of the factors above and the interaction between them.The principles underpinning a redress schemeWe set out in June the principles that would guide a redress scheme. These are:comprehensivenessfairnesscertaintysimplicity and cost effectivenesstimelinesstransparencymarket integrityThere may be tensions between these principles, which will require us to strike the right balance. We will explore these during the consultation.Scope and design of redress schemeWe have been carefully analysing the Supreme Court’s judgment and how it may affect the scope and structure of a redress scheme. While that work is ongoing, we want to provide as much clarity and certainty to consumers and firms as quickly as possible.Our consultation will cover how firms should assess whether the relationship between the lender and borrower was unfair for the purposes of our scheme and if so, what compensation should be paid.In the Supreme Court case and our review of past practices, the unfairness to consumers has arisen from the non-disclosure of particular features of the commission arrangements. But many of these features are not themselves unfair. And the Supreme Court said that non-disclosure or partial disclosure of the commission will not necessarily make the relationship unfair.Our consultation will, therefore, need to consider how a range of factors must be assessed together when deciding on whether the relationship was unfair. As we prepare the consultation, we will consider if and how factors such as the non-disclosure of the nature and size of the commission, tied commercial relationships and customer sophistication should be factored in.Discretionary commission arrangements and non- discretionary commission arrangementsWe will propose that the scheme covers discretionary commission arrangements (DCAs) – where the broker could adjust the interest rate offered to a customer – if they were not properly disclosed.We will also consult on which non-discretionary commission arrangements should be included. This is because the Supreme Court decision in the Johnson case, which did not include the payment of any discretionary commission, makes clear that non-disclosure of other facts relating to the commission can make the relationship unfair.Redress calculationOur methodology for calculating redress will be informed by the degree of harm suffered by the consumer and the need to ensure consumers continue to be able to access affordable loans for motor vehicles.The Supreme Court decided that the appropriate remedy in the Johnson case was the payment of the commission. We will consider this option alongside alternative approaches. It is unlikely any alternative would lead to higher remedies overall than full repayment of commission. Some could lead to lower payments.We will consult on whether there should be a de minimis threshold to be eligible for a compensation payment.InterestInterest is normally paid on redress awards. This should be fair and proportionate. In the case it upheld, the Supreme Court required a commercial rate of interest to be paid.We plan to consult on an interest rate for each year of the scheme based on the average base rate that year plus 1%. This would be in the ballpark of a simple interest rate of 3% per annum.TimeframeWe think the scheme should cover agreements dating back to 2007, to be consistent with the complaints the Financial Ombudsman can consider and to ensure the scheme is comprehensive. This would mean consumers would not need to use other routes to secure compensation and prevent large numbers of ongoing disputes in the courts. We are discussing with the Government the best way of doing this.Opt in / opt outWe have not yet decided whether to propose an opt-in or opt-out scheme. There are pros and cons to either approach and a range of views, which will be explored thoroughly through the consultation.Whichever approach we propose, we anticipate requiring firms as far as possible to make customers aware they may be eligible and what they may need to do.High commissionThe Supreme Court found that a high and undisclosed commission – in this case 55% of the total cost of the credit – was ‘a powerful indication’ of an unfair relationship. The court also found that this was a breach of our rules, as disclosure of so high a commission would have had a ‘material impact’ on the customer’s decision.We will, therefore, need to consider what size of commission in the context of the overall finance arrangements may point towards unfairness if not disclosed.Total cost of redressThe final cost of any redress scheme will depend on the final design and the factors, including those set out above.This makes it hard to estimate precisely at this stage the total cost to industry of the scheme. Any estimates are highly indicative and susceptible to change.The final cost will also depend on the take-up rate, the methodology to calculate redress and the mix of discretionary and non-discretionary arrangements ultimately included.At this stage, we think it is unlikely that the cost of any scheme, including administrative costs would be materially lower than £9bn and it could be materially higher. While there are plausible scenarios which underpin estimates of a total cost as high as £18bn, we do not consider those scenarios to be the most likely and analyst estimates in the mid point of this range are more plausible.The FCA currently estimates that most individuals will probably receive less than £950 in compensation per agreement.Market impactWe have been analysing the potential impact of a redress scheme on firms and the motor finance market. We expect a healthy finance market for new and used cars to continue notwithstanding any redress scheme we propose. We will set out more detailed analysis in our consultation and continue to monitor market functioning.Advice to firmsFirms must comply with the law and our rules. We also welcomed the industry-led practices to enhance the information provided to customers following the Court of Appeal judgment of 25 October 2024 on motor commission arrangements. Under the Consumer Duty, we increasingly monitor outcomes consumers are receiving as well as compliance with rules. Our view is that these updated practices are contributing to better consumer outcomes.Prudential rules require regulated firms to maintain adequate financial resources. Firms with listed securities must also keep the market properly informed. Each firm must make their own assessment of potential liabilities, as many have done.Firms should now refresh their estimates, ensuring they cover both liability for compensation and the administrative costs. There will remain a degree of uncertainty about these estimates until a redress scheme is finalised, but it is important that firms act and make sufficient provisions, increasing them where necessary.Complaints deadlineFirms currently do not have to provide a final response to relevant motor finance complaints before 4 December 2025. We will consult on further extending this deadline to align with the timetable for compensation payments of the proposed redress scheme.This will prevent disorderly, inconsistent and inefficient outcomes for consumers and knock-on effects on firms and the market.Advice to consumersPeople who have already complained don’t need to do anything. Our advice remains that consumers concerned that they were not told about commission and who think they may have paid too much for the finance, should complain now.We aim to make any scheme easy to participate in, without needing to use a claims management company (CMC) or law firm. Using a CMC or law firm may end up costing them up to 30% in fees of any compensation they receive.Over the last year, the FCA has required 225 promotions from CMCs on motor finance to be amended or withdrawn, including some which were highly speculative in suggesting the compensation consumers may get.We will continue to act against firms using clickbait-style promotions or language that suggests a guaranteed outcome before any investigation into a consumer’s claim has taken place. Firms must ensure that all financial promotions are clear, fair, and not misleading, and that they accurately reflect the nature and status of any potential claims.We will ensure firms handle claims consistently, efficiently and fairly.Next stepsWe recognise that consumers want to receive any compensation owed quickly and firms and investors want certainty.We will be working intensively and engaging widely over the coming weeks on the detail of how a scheme would work.We aim to publish the consultation by early October and for it to be open for 6 weeks. No final decisions have yet been taken in relation to the scheme. We aim to finalise the rules such that the scheme can launch in 2026, with consumers starting to receive compensation next year.", "ingested_utc": "2025-08-14T06:45:04Z", "retrieved_utc": "2025-08-14T06:45:04Z"}

Financial promotion rules will apply so consumers get the right information and aren’t offered inappropriate incentives to invest. David Geale, executive director of payments and digital finance at the FCA, said:'Since we restricted retail access to cETNs, the market has evolved, and products have become more mainstream and better understood. In light of this, we’re providing consumers with more choice, while ensuring there are protections in place. This should mean people get the information they need to assess whether the level of risk is right for them.'The Consumer Duty will apply to firms offering these products to retail investors. However, there won’t be coverage from the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS).

We have outlined our crypto roadmap and recently published proposals on stablecoins as well as other aspects of the regime.The FCA’s ban on retail access to cryptoasset derivatives will remain in place. The FCA will continue to monitor market developments and consider its approach to high-risk investments.Notes to editorsIn January 2021, the FCA banned the sale, marketing and distribution of derivatives and ETNs that reference unregulated transferable cryptoassets to retail clients.In March 2024, the FCA announced we would not object to requests from recognised investment exchanges (such as Cboe or the London Stock Exchange) to create a UK listed market segment for cryptoasset-backed exchange traded notes (cETNs) for professional investors. In June 2025, the FCA launched a consultation on proposals to lift the ban on retail access to cETNs.The FCA grants recognition orders to investment exchanges in the UK to make sure they meet regulatory standards.

It has the potential to transform decision-making and customer experiences in UK financial services for the better. But it also raises concerns about how it can be used safely and responsibly. This can slow the pace of innovation if left unanswered as well as introduce new risks.That's why we’re proposing AI Live Testing – a practical, collaborative way for firms and the FCA to explore methods to assure AI systems together. Here, we set out why you should apply to take part. The promise of AI Using AI can result in: Smarter decision-making: Models can process huge volumes of data to assess risk, automate compliance, and tailor financial products.Stronger protections: Machine learning systems are spotting anomalies and stopping fraud before it affects consumers. Better experiences: Natural language models and predictive analytics can personalise financial products to better meet consumer needs. But this innovation depends on more than just computing power and data. Crucially, it also depends on confidence that AI can be used safely and responsibly in UK financial markets. Otherwise, innovation will stall. We want the UK to be a place where beneficial technological innovation can thrive to support growth and competitiveness. The question then becomes: how can we build confidence in AI so that consumers and markets benefit? The regulatory challenge: clarity without closureYet, this is where financial services regulators face a tricky balance. On the one hand, at the FCA we recognise that firms need regulatory clarity on AI – a predictable framework to guide their investments, operations, and risk management.On the other hand, we also recognise that if we, as the UK's financial services regulator, move too quickly or narrowly, we could unintentionally stifle innovation. Also, any regulatory action could potentially become out-dated very quickly as the technology evolves at pace. A collaborative path forward: AI Live TestingAI Live Testing is a practical, hands-on way to build trust, reduce risk, and accelerate safe and responsible innovation. This isn’t a compliance exercise. It’s a partnership. It provides a structured but flexible space where firms can test AI-driven services in real-world conditions, with appropriate regulatory support and oversight (see the Terms of Reference (PDF)). It will help firms who are further along in AI development and are ready to use in markets. This will allow both sides to:Understand how an AI system performs in live market contexts – in practice and not just in theory.Identify potential risks early and adapt controls accordingly.Explore potential assurance methods that are grounded in how AI is used in a specific market context; not just what’s ideal on paper.Share insights that feed into smarter, more future-proof AI approaches.AI Live Testing complements the FCA's Supercharged Sandbox, which is focused on firms who are in the discovery and experiment phase of their AI product's development. This joined-up approach mirrors the spirit of innovation itself: test, learn, iterate, improve. It's a core part of the FCA's AI innovation offering through the AI Lab and set out in our Engagement Paper on AI Live Testing.Why you should take partWe know that complex questions around how AI systems will perform in the real world can significantly slow the pace of innovation. That's why we want to help firms by providing a place where they can test. AI Live Testing can offer you:Clarity on expectations: Get early, practical feedback on what regulators are looking for when it comes to, for example, considerations around explainability, fairness, performance, and controls. Less guesswork. Confidence in deployment: Test how your AI system behaves under real operating conditions to ensure it works in a safe and responsible way. A chance to shape best practice: Your experience in AI Live Testing helps inform insights and best practice for the rest of industry. You can help make sure that regulatory approaches are grounded in operational reality and make a genuine difference for the better for consumers and markets.What AI Live Testing isn't FCA AI Live Testing is not designed to become a tool to approve or certify that an AI model is OK to use. We don’t believe this is within the FCA's remit. It also isn't an enforcement or supervisory function – it's entirely voluntary.From model evaluation to AI system evaluation Much of the broader AI assurance debate has focused on how AI models operate. But when it comes to AI deployment, the model is just one part of a broader AI system. This is particularly true for financial services, where we need to understand how AI systems behave in real-world market situations. We define an AI system as an ecosystem of people, processes and technologies designed to deliver intended outcomes. It includes the model, data pipeline, human oversight, testing and governance. Considering the AI system as a whole is key to reducing bias, improving accuracy, and increasing transparency.And yet, our work to date suggests that some of the most important questions are more fundamental and even come before considering issues such as bias or accuracy. They are: What is the intended goal and outcome for the AI system – at a point in time and over time?What are the key risks relative to use case context, as well as considerations around regulatory compliance?How can these risks be best mitigated and what residual risks are acceptable? Do we have a shared framework to assess these risks? These are not academic questions. They’re about ensuring that the AI system is tested for its real-world impact – including its impact on consumers and markets (see ‘AI for growth – how the FCA can help’). These are live issues that respondents to our Engagement Paper on AI Live Testing are considering. We will be sharing more details when we publish the Feedback Statement in September 2025. AI Live Testing is a bridge between beneficial innovation and assurance. It gives you a structured way to take bold steps forward, with the reassurance that you're building on solid ground.We’re inviting financial firms of all sizes to take part. If you’re building something ambitious and want to get it right, this is your chance to test, learn, and lead.Join us in shaping the safe and responsible future of AI in UK financial markets.", "ingested_utc": "2025-08-14T06:45:04Z", "retrieved_utc": "2025-08-14T06:45:04Z"}

An FCA investigation found that Mr Alba lacked integrity because he misled the FCA.Between April 2015 and November 2019, H2O failed to carry out proper due diligence on investments relating to the Tennor Group of companies owned by Lars Windhorst, or companies he introduced.The investments were high risk and hard to sell, leaving investor money trapped. In 2024, the FCA agreed that H2O would pay those investors €250 million.During the FCA’s investigation into H2O, Mr Alba provided false and misleading statements and documentation to the regulator. Mr Alba was the principal point of contact with the FCA during its investigation.Mr Alba asked junior colleagues to create minutes, including records and minutes of committees, where no formal meetings had taken place. Mr Alba also provided due diligence materials, such as investment research, to the FCA that had been created years after the investments had been made, when he had claimed they were produced at the time.Steve Smart, joint executive director of enforcement and market oversight, said:'Senior leaders in financial services need to act with integrity. Mr Alba fell well short of those basic standards.'He has no place in the industry. This ban and substantial fine should serve as a warning to others that if you mislead the FCA, you will face the consequences.'Notes to editorsRead the final notice (PDF)The FCA investigation found that Mr Alba breached APER Statement of Principle 1 (failed to act with integrity) and Statement of Principle 4 (failed to deal with the FCA in an open and cooperative way); and Individual Conduct Rule 1 (failed to act with integrity) and Individual Conduct Rule 3 (failed to deal with the FCA in an open and cooperative way).The FCA previously announced H2O would pay €250 million to affected investors following its investigation. Following its application to voluntarily cancel its permissions in the UK, H2O is no longer authorised in the UK. Mr Alba was previously identified in the final notice as 'Senior Manager A'.The French financial services regulator, the Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF), is the designated regulator in respect of the collective investments, which H2O had managed on a cross-border basis pursuant to the UCITS Directive.", "ingested_utc": "2025-08-14T06:45:04Z", "retrieved_utc": "2025-08-14T06:45:04Z"}

The latest missive from Mark Gurman at Bloomberg suggests that Apple is shifting its artificial intelligence goals to center on new device segments. Sources reportedly told the publication that Apple has a slate of new smart home products in the works that could help pivot its lagging AI strategy. The center of the new lineup is a tabletop AI companion that has been described as an iPad on a movable robotic arm. It would be able to swivel to face the screen toward a user as they move around their home or office. Sources said the current prototype uses a horizontal display that's about seven inches while the motorized arm can move the screen about six inches away from the base in any direction. Equipped with a long-promised overhaul to the Siri voice assistant, this device could act like an additional person, recalling information, making suggestions and participating in conversations. According to Bloomberg , Apple is targeting a 2027 release for this product. Apple's new lineup is also rumored to include a smart home hub that is a simpler version of the robotic friend with no moving stand. We might be seeing this sooner, with a projected 2026 release for the device. This hub device would be able to control music playback, take notes, browse the web and host videoconferencing. Both the robot companion and the smart home hub are reportedly running a new operating system called Charismatic that's designed to support multiple users. The Siri running on the device will be given a particularly cheery personality, and it may also be getting a visual representation. Bloomberg 's sources said there hasn't been a final decision on aesthetics; internal tests have had Siri looking like an animated Finder icon and like a Memoji. Today's scuttlebutt follows on previous reports from Gurman that pointed to Apple's interest in these categories. The idea of a smart home hub was apparently floated at the company as far back as 2022, and it's finally being rumored to have a formal debut some time this year. Robots have also been a topic of interest in Cupertino for some time, with claims that Apple was developing a personal robot dating back at least to last spring . While this Bloomberg piece offers more detail about those hypothetical plans, there's always a chance Apple will change direction or scrap a project.

After having hundreds of half-filled notebooks over the years, I, at some point, turned to digital tools instead because it was just easier to store everything on my phone or laptop so I always had my most important information at my fingertips. E-Ink tablets seem to provide the best of both worlds: the tactile satisfaction of regular notebooks with many of the conveniences found in digital tools, plus easy-on-the-eyes E-Ink screens. These devices have come a long way in recent years — now you can find them in multiple sizes, some have color E Ink screens and others double as full-blow ereaders with access to ebook stores and your local library’s offerings. I’ve tested out close to a dozen E Ink tablets over the past few years to see how well they work, how convenient they really are and which are the best tablets using E Ink screens available today. Table of contents Best E Ink tablets for 2025 Are E Ink tablets worth it? What to look for in an E Ink tablet Other E Ink tablets we've tested Best E Ink tablets for 2025 Are E Ink tablets worth it? An E Ink tablet will be a worthwhile purchase to a very select group of people. If you prefer the look and feel of an e paper display to LCD panels found on traditional tablets, it makes a lot of sense. They’re also good options for those who want a more paper-like writing experience (although you can get that kind of functionality on a regular tablet with the right screen protector) or a more distraction-free device overall. The final note is key here. Many E Ink tablets don’t run on the same operating systems as regular tablets, so you’re automatically going to be limited in what you can do. And even with those that do allow you to download traditional apps like Chrome, Instagram and Facebook, E Ink tablets are not designed to give you the best casual-browsing experience. This is mostly due to the nature of E Ink displays, which have noticeable refreshes, a lack of vibrant colors and lower picture quality than the panels you’ll find on even the cheapest iPad. Arguably the biggest reason why you wouldn’t want to go with an iPad (all models of which support stylus input, a plethora of reading apps, etc) is because it’s much easier to get distracted by email, social media and other Internet-related temptations. What to look for in an E Ink tablet Writing and latency Arguably the most important thing to consider when looking for an E Ink tablet is the writing experience. How good it is will depend a lot on the display’s refresh rate (does it refresh after every time you put pen to “paper,” or at a different regular interval) and the stylus’ latency. Most of the tablets I’ve tested have little to no latency, but some are certainly better than others. Finally, you should double check before buying that your preferred E Ink tablet comes with a stylus, or if you need to purchase one separately. Reading How much will you be reading books, documents and other things on this tablet? E Ink tablets come in many sizes, but most of them tend to be larger than your standard e-reader because it makes writing much easier. Having a larger display isn’t a bad thing, but it might make holding it for long periods slightly more uncomfortable. (Most e-readers are roughly the size of a paperback book, giving you a similar feeling to analog reading). The supported file types for e-books can also make a big difference. It’s hard to make a blanket statement here because this varies so much among E Ink tablets. The TL;DR is that you’ll have a much better reading experience if you go with one made by a company that already has a history in e-book sales (i.e. Amazon or Kobo). All of the titles you bought via the Kindle or Kobo store should automatically be available to you on your Kindle or Kobo E Ink tablet. Also with Kindle titles, specifically, since they are protected by DRM, it’s not necessarily the best idea to try to bring those titles over to a third-party device . Unless the tablet runs an operating system like Android that supports downloads for apps like Kindle and Kobo, you’ll be limited to supported file types, like ePUB, PDF, MOBI, JPEG, PNG and others. Search functionality Most E Ink tablets have some on-device search features, but they can vary widely between models. You’ll want to consider how important it is to you to be able to search through all your handwritten notes and markups. I noticed in my testing that Amazon’s and Kobo’s E Ink tablets made it easy to refer back to notes made in books and files because they automatically save to the specific pages on which you took notes, made highlights and more. Searching is less standardized on E Ink tablets that have different supported file types, but their features can be quite powerful in their own right. For example, a few devices I tested supported text search in handwritten notes along with handwriting recognition, the latter of which allows you to translate your scribbles into typed text. Sharing and connectivity While we established that E Ink tablets can be great distraction-free devices, most manufacturers understand that your notes and doodles aren’t created in a vacuum. You may want to access them elsewhere, and that requires some form of connectivity. All of the E Ink tablets I tried have Wi-Fi support, and some support cloud syncing, companion mobile apps and the ability to export notes via email so you can access them elsewhere. None of them, however, integrate directly with a digital note taking system like Evernote or OneNote, so these devices will always be somewhat supplementary if you use apps like that, too. I’d argue that, if you already lean heavily on apps like OneNote, a standard tablet with a stylus and screen protector might be the best way to go. Ultimately, you should think about what you will want to do with the documents you’ll interact with on your E Ink tablet after the tablet portion is done. Price E Ink tablets aren’t known for being cheap. They generally fall into the $300-$800 price range, which is what you can expect to pay for a solid regular tablet, too. A key factor in price is size: cheaper devices with E Ink displays are likely to have smaller screens, and stylus support isn’t as much of a given. Also, those types of devices are generally considered e-readers because of their size and may not be the best for note-taking, doodling and the like. E Ink tablets have gone up in price recently. Supernote and Onyx Boox increased prices, as did reMarkable. The former said it was due to \"increased costs,” and a reMarkable representative confirmed this to Engadget and provided the following statement: \"We regularly review our pricing based on market conditions and operational costs. We've communicated an upcoming adjustment for the US market effective in May to provide transparency to our customers. Multiple factors influence our pricing decisions, including supply chain dynamics and overall operational costs in specific markets.” As a result, the reMarkable Paper Pro jumped from $579 to $629 (that's for the bundle with the standard Marker and no Folio). This isn't great, considering the Paper Pro was already on the expensive side of the spectrum for E Ink tablets. It's also worth noting that Supernote and Onyx Boox have raised prices in the past few months as well. Other E Ink tablets we've tested Lenovo Smart Paper Lenovo made a solid E Ink tablet in the Smart Paper , but it's too pricey and too married to the company's companion cloud service to warrant a spot on our top picks list. The hardware is great, but the software isn't as flexible as those of competitors like the reMarkable 2. It has good Google Drive integration, but you must pair it with Lenovo's cloud service to really get the most use out of it — and in the UK, the service costs £9 per month for three months, which is quite expensive. Onyx Boox Tab Ultra The Boox Tab Ultra has a lot of the same features we like in the Note Air 2 Plus, but it’s designed to be a true, all-purpose tablet with an E Ink screen. Running Android 11 and compatible with a magnetic keyboard case, you can use it like a standard 2-in-1 laptop, albeit a low-powered one. You can browse the web, check email and even watch YouTube videos on this thing — but that doesn’t mean you should. A standard 2-in-1 laptop with a more responsive screen and better overall performance would be a better fit for most people who even have the slightest desire to have an all-in-one device. Like the rest of Onyx’s devices, the Tab Ultra is specifically for those who put reading and eye comfort above all else.

Whether you're watching blockbuster movies, listening to music or gaming, a good soundbar delivers clearer vocals, deep bass and better overall playback than most built-in TV speakers ever could. In 2025, there’s a soundbar for every kind of home entertainment setup — from compact all-in-one units to full surround systems with subwoofers and rear speakers. Some prioritize simplicity and sleek design, while others are packed with immersive features like Dolby Atmos and smart voice controls. No matter your budget or your space, we’ve picked the best soundbars you can buy right now to help elevate your audio experience. Table of contents The post-CES soundbar outlook for 2025 Best soundbars for 2025 What to look for in a soundbar Other soundbars we tested Best soundbar FAQs The post-CES soundbar outlook for 2025 I typically come out of CES with a pretty clear understanding of the new soundbars that are coming for the year, but that wasn’t exactly the case in 2025. LG decided to carry over its most premium soundbars from 2024 , but it will add the compact S20A this year. The company only previewed the model at CES, so full specs are still forthcoming. Samsung will once again keep the same overall design and features for its top-end Q990 soundbar. However, the company is adding a few new tools and it drastically reduced the size of the wireless subwoofer that comes in the box. Samsung does have one new model for 2025, the QS700F , that’s designed to sit on a table or automatically adjust to being mounted flat on a wall. Details are scarce on that soundbar for now and I anticipate a full spec sheet when the company is really to sell it. Of the big three TV companies, Sony is the only one that didn’t announce any home theater gear at CES. The company has decided to focus mainly on its automotive efforts at the show recently, leaving TV and audio announcements for later in the year. The company debuted multiple soundbar options in 2024 and a four-speaker setup for the living room in the Bravia Quad . That said, it wouldn’t surprise me if Sony released new soundbars later in the year since its most recent models were only announced last April. One company I would keep an eye on is Sennheiser. The original Ambeo model is nearly six years old and could use a refresh. The company has added medium and mini options to the Ambeo lineup since then, but it would be nice to see a refined version of the largest model too. The original Ambeo soundbar is huge, so no matter how good it sounds, it will always be a tough sell for some people. Although I think it’s less likely, it’s also possible that Sonos has new soundbars this year. While the company’s next device will likely be the rumored set-top streaming box, the Sound Motion tech inside the Arc Ultra would offer a big improvement to bass performance in compact models like the Beam and Ray . The company may bring Sound Motion to standalone speakers first, but it’s destined for those smaller soundbars eventually . The best soundbars for 2025 What to look for in a soundbar Features When it comes to features, the more you pay the more you're going to get in your new audio system. Most affordable options ($150 or less) will improve your television's audio quality, but that's about it. Step into the $300 to $400 range and you'll find all-in-one soundbars with things like built-in voice control, wireless connectivity, Google Chromecast, AirPlay 2 and even Android TV. They're all helpful when you want to avoid looking for the remote control, but the best playback quality is usually only in the top tier and the formats those premium soundbar systems support. I’m talking about things like Dolby Atmos, DTS:X and other high-resolution audio standards — essentials if you’re building a truly cinematic home entertainment setup. And not all Atmos soundbars are equal, so you'll need to look at the finer details carefully before you break into the savings account. If you're looking for one of the best Dolby Atmos soundbars, size, channels and subwoofer options will be important factors to consider. Some models even include a dedicated subwoofer to enhance bass performance, bringing an extra punch to action scenes and soundtracks. Ports This is a big one. A lot of the more affordable soundbars are limited when it comes to connectivity options. They either offer an optical port or one HDMI jack and, if you're lucky, both. Things get slightly better in the mid-range section, but that's not always the case. The Sonos Beam, for example, is $449, but only has a single HDMI port. Even at the higher-end, the $899 Sonos Arc still only has one HDMI port. If you plan to connect multiple devices like a set-top box, gaming laptop or console directly to your soundbar for the best audio experience, you’ll want an option with at least two HDMI (eARC) inputs. HDMI connections are critical for supporting Dolby Atmos and Dolby Digital audio formats, as well as high-res passthrough for HDR and 8K/4K content. Channels Another big thing you’ll want to pay attention to when looking for the best soundbar is channels. That’s the 2.1, 7.1.2 or other decimal number that companies include in product descriptions. The first figure corresponds to the number of channels. A two would just be left and right while a more robust Atmos system, especially one with rear surround speakers, could be five or seven (left, right, center and upward). The second number refers to the dedicated subwoofer, so if your new soundbar comes with one or has them built in, you’ll see one here. The third numeral is up-firing speakers, important for the immersive effect of Dolby Atmos. Not all Atmos-enabled units have them, but if they do, the third number will tell you how many are in play and how they contribute to the overall soundstage. Wireless Most soundbars these days offer either Bluetooth, Wi-Fi or both. When it comes to Wi-Fi, that connectivity affords you luxuries like voice control (either built-in or with a separate device), Chromecast, Spotify Connect and AirPlay 2. Depending on your preferences, you might be able to live without some of these. For me, AirPlay 2 and Chromecast are essentials, but the rest I can live without. Those two give me the ability to beam music and podcasts from my go-to apps without having to settle for — or struggle with — a Bluetooth connection. For instance, Sonos speakers often offer seamless integration with iOS devices, making it easy to connect and stream music wirelessly. If you’re looking for a wireless speaker that can enhance your TV setup while also offering flexibility for audio throughout the house, it's worth considering a multi-room system. Size This one might seem obvious but humor me for a minute. Nothing is more soul-crushing than getting a pricey soundbar in your living room only to discover you have to rearrange everything to find a spot for it. This was my plight when the Sennheiser Ambeo Soundbar arrived at my door. Yes, that speaker is absurdly large (and heavy), and most soundbars aren't nearly as big. I learned a valuable lesson: Make sure the space where you want to put a soundbar will accommodate the thing you're about to spend hundreds (if not thousands) of dollars on. Basically, it all comes down to the TV you have (or are planning to get) and what the primary goal is for your living-room audio. Is it ease of use? Do you want the best possible sound from a single speaker or speaker/sub combo? Do you just want to be able to actually hear your TV better? Or do you want a full home entertainment experience with crisp vocals, thunderous deep bass, and immersive surround system audio? By paying attention to each of those areas, you should have a good idea of what to look for in a soundbar, soundbar/subwoofer combo, Dolby Digital system or a more robust setup. With that said, we've put numerous products through their paces at Engadget and have a few favorites for best soundbar at various price points to get you started. Other soundbars we tested Sony Bravia Theater Bar 6 There’s a lot to like about the Bravia Theater Bar 6 , Sony’s new midrange option in its soundbar lineup. Sound quality is the speaker’s best attribute, even though it’s limited by its 3.1.2-channel configuration. The biggest two issues with this model are the lack of Wi-Fi connectivity — which means no AirPlay, Chromecast or Spotify Connect — and the need to use your computer and a thumb drive to install firmware updates. Neither of those should be things you have to consider on a $650 soundbar in 2025. Sonos Arc There’s no doubt that the Arc is Sonos’ best-sounding soundbar, but it’s also the company’s most expensive. With a new model based on the Arc rumored to be on the way , it’s difficult to recommend this product over the likes of Samsung and Sony. The Arc works well as both a soundbar and a speaker, and the device will fit in nicely with other Sonos gear you might already have for a multiroom setup. It only has one HDMI port though, where much of the competition allows you to connect streaming and gaming devices directly to their soundbars. Sennheiser Ambeo Soundbar Plus I don’t think Sennheiser’s medium-sized model offers enough to stand out from the more powerful Ambeo Soundbar Max or the Ambeo Soundbar Mini . The Mini is more affordable and does a solid job with immersive audio in its own right. Like the rest of the Ambeo lineup, there’s no option for satellite speakers as you can only add a subwoofer to the soundbars. However, the Ambeo Soundbar Plus does have RCA input, so you can use it with a turntable if you’re into vinyl. Best soundbar FAQs Is a soundbar better than speakers? It really depends on what you’re after. A soundbar is definitely a simpler, more compact solution compared to a full speaker setup. If you want better sound than your TV’s built-in setup but don’t want to deal with multiple speakers and wires everywhere, a soundbar is probably the way to go. Some soundbars can even deliver impressive surround sound effects, thanks to features like Dolby Atmos and virtual audio technology. However, if you’re an audiophile or want true surround sound for an at-home theater experience, a multi-speaker setup with a receiver, surround speakers and subwoofer will give you a richer soundstage and more control over your experience. What connection do I need for a soundbar? Most modern soundbars connect to your TV via HDMI ARC or eARC, which is the easiest and best option for achieving high-quality audio. If your TV supports this, all you need is an HDMI cable, and you’ll get not only great sound but also some extra features like controlling the soundbar with your TV remote. If HDMI ARC isn’t an option on your TV, you can use an optical cable, which also delivers solid audio quality. Some soundbars even offer Bluetooth or Wi-Fi connections for streaming music, and a few still have a 3.5mm aux jack for connecting to older devices. Do all soundbars come with subwoofers? Not all soundbars come with subwoofers, but many do or at least offer one as an optional add-on that you can purchase separately. A subwoofer is what gives you that deep, booming bass, so if you like action movies or want a fuller sound for music, having one can make a big difference. Some soundbars have a built-in subwoofer, but these generally don’t provide the same punch as a separate one.

And I was one of them (even if I’d personally lose little sleep if Super Mario Sunshine was fired directly into the sun). But as much as I want the obvious GameCube classics on my Switch 2 , it’s the more underrated gems I’ve heard so much about from hardcore Nintendo fans over the years that really pique my interest. Games like Chibi-Robo! , for example, which Nintendo has confirmed as the next title joining the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion pack library on August 21. Say hello to Chibi-Robo! Join him on his quest to restore order to the Sanderson house and save the world in Chibi-Robo!, coming to Nintendo GameCube – Nintendo Classics on #NintendoSwitch2 for #NintendoSwitchOnline + Expansion Pack members on Aug 21! pic.twitter.com/BWjL2CbHdL — Nintendo of America (@NintendoAmerica) August 13, 2025 Chibi-Robo! is a 2005 platform-adventure game about a friendly little robot whose main goal is to help the Sanderson family by taking on various housework-related missions and performing generally good deeds on request. Chibi-Robo’s helpfulness isn’t limited to humans, though. In its quest to spread happiness, it also assists several animals and even enchanted toys along the way. As a player, you have to keep an eye on the robot’s battery life and use power outlets dotted around the house to recharge it. Fail to do so and it’ll collapse, and you’ll lose a chunk of the in-game currency you’ve collected. Chibi-Robo! looks like a typically charming Nintendo game in every respect, but it was actually originally conceived by now-defunct developer Skip Ltd. as a point-and-click adventure game, with Bandai as the publisher. Exactly how or why the game ended up moving over to Nintendo remains a mystery, but director Kenichi Nishi told Time Extension that Shigeru Miyamoto took a particular liking to the character design. The legendary Mario creator then went on to play something of an overseer role in the game’s development under its new publisher. Chibi-Robo! spawned a number of handheld spinoffs, but the original game remains the one with cult classic status. It’s also become increasingly hard to play over the years, with Nintendo choosing not to port the game forward. These days you can expect to pay as much as $200 for a second-hand physical copy. As someone who categorically does not have that kind of cash to chuck at a 20-year-old video game (or any game for that matter), I’m looking forward to seeing what all the fuss is about when it lands on Switch 2 next week.

On Wednesday, the developer said that the game will transition to PS5 and Xbox Series X/S on November 13. Although the battle royale has been playable on current-gen consoles all along, it was running as a PS4 or Xbox One game. That helped it cast a wide net (and probably make more money), but it also came with technical limitations. The company said the move to current-gen will \"provide our players with a more stable gameplay environment on console and ensure a smoother, more seamless experience with future updates.\" PS5 players can expect the new version to play in 1440p at 60fps. Both the PS5 Pro and Xbox Series X will reach 2160p at 60fps. However, the two high-end systems will support Dynamic 4K resolution. Meanwhile, the Xbox Series S will run at 1080p at 60fps or 1440p at 30fps. (Your choice.) Here's how PUBG: Battlegrounds currently looks on PS5. PUBG / Krafton And this is how it will look after November 13. It's a subtle difference at first glance, but you can see more detail, including pronounced shadows. PUBG / Krafton When the cutoff arrives, the game will no longer be downloadable or playable on PS4 and Xbox One. PlayStation users will need to download a separate PS5 version of the game on November 13. If you already have it installed on your Xbox Series X/S, the current-gen update will install automatically via Microsoft's Smart Delivery . On both systems, your existing account data and purchased items will transition automatically. PUBG left its last-gen users a sentimental message that sounds a bit like a corporate layoff letter. \"We still vividly remember the epic battles, the heart-stopping moments, and the camaraderie that brought us together,\" the company wrote. \"We are deeply grateful for every moment you've spent with us over the past eight years.\" This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pubg-battlegrounds-will-leave-ps4-and-xbox-one-behind-later-this-year-162932937.html?src=rss", "ingested_utc": "2025-08-14T19:38:54Z", "retrieved_utc": "2025-08-14T19:38:54Z"}

The basic gameplay remains, with players being asked to feed, groom and play with small digital creatures inside a handheld device. But new features have also been added, like Bluetooth connectivity and downloadable content (they're also a little bigger than before). This month, however, Hasbro is throwing its hat into the ring with the Nano-Mals, a $20 device that takes the standard features of a virtual pet and aims them toward a new purpose: fidget toy. The first thing you’ll probably notice when you pick up one of the eight initial Nano-Mals models is how cute they all are: they’re styled after both common and uncommon animals, including two cows, two cats, a red panda, a narwhal, and a pair of unicorns.But the second thing you’ll notice is that there’s no screen to be found anywhere; instead, the sole “display” is a a light-up heart on the front of the toy that has three levels and changes color to indicate how satiated the toy is in terms of hunger, affection and play. How you fulfill these needs is where the Nano-mals distinguish themselves from other virtual pets: Instead of pushing buttons and navigating through various menus, you interact instead with the various parts of the toy directly. Push down on its ear to “pet” it, flip its arms to “dance” and push its nose to “feed” it. The more you perform these actions, the more each color of the heart will fill up, eventually resulting in a rainbow kaleidoscope across the toy’s chest. It’s incredibly easy to do, not just because these are simple actions, but because they’re engineered to be satisfying since it is a fidget toy. It feels good to flip the arms up and down and squish the ears. Not so much for pushing the shallow nose button though, meaning it was often the need that took the longest for me to fulfill. It just wasn’t fun to push the nose! I can only hope that future iterations improve on this. Once you’ve figured out the basic functions, it becomes a game in itself to figure out the best way to hold and interact with the device. You don’t need to look at it and the entire thing can be operated with one hand, which is exactly what you want in a fidget toy. I found myself rotating it between my fingers while flipping the arms – the device also contains an accelerometer so any significant movement also counts as “play.” If you have more than one Nano-mal – which is quite likely given the device’s low price – the toys will interact with each other, lighting up and talking to each other. It’s cute but also a bit unsettling, as it was very reminiscent of this year’s Black Mirror episode “Playthings” with the Nano-mals emitting mysterious bleats and chimes just like the Thronglets. Fortunately, there is an off switch, and the Nano-mals will burble happily before shutting down when you use it. Kris Naudus for Engadget However, the off switch isn’t absolute as, should you press any of the buttons, the Nano-mal will still react, though maybe not effusively as if the device were powered fully on. This is a problem given that the Nano-mal is meant to be taken out and about (there’s even a clip at the top), but will likely be banned from classrooms due to the possibility of it being accidentally triggered when a kid moves their stuff. The toys can be muted by holding down the nose for a few seconds, but it only works when the device is fully powered on, and resets every time the Nano-mal is turned off and on. Aside from that and the fact that I couldn’t remove the attachment clip, which got in the way when I was trying to spin the device in my hand, I think the Nano-mal is a solid first try at this kind of toy. Kids will love how cute they are, especially when you dress them up in the included clothes, which double as protective cases for the devices. And adults will appreciate them too: Parents are big on screen-free devices, while the young-at-heart will appreciate having something to keep their hands busy that isn’t their phone. The Nano-mals are available now at all major toy retailers, including Walmart and Amazon .

So instead of watchOS 12, I’ve spent the past two weeks with the public beta of watchOS 26. The naming scheme shift is subtle, but helpful — which is how I’d describe the upgrades the new software brings to the Apple Watch. The AI-powered Workout Buddy better contextualizes your Fitness data and an added gesture gives the watch a fun trick that’s actually helpful. Other upgrades — including better smart replies and the Liquid Glass treatment — all combine to make the watch work and look a bit better than it did before. It’s not a game-changing shift, like other OS 26 releases , but it manages to make a great watch a touch better. Luminous Liquid Glass Every Apple operating system got the Liquid Glass treatment this year, including watchOS 26. The change is less noticeable on the Apple Watch than on the iPhone or iPad, though. You’ll notice the semi-transparent buttons and flowy movement when entering your password and opening the control center — the icons look like they’re surrounded in little drops of water, which is quite pretty. You’ll see it on the Photos watch face, too, especially if you select the “glass” color for the time readout. The Liquid Glass treatment for the Photos watch face. Amy Skorheim for Engadget The Smart Stack now has a liminal glow and the app icons are likewise a touch more luminous than before. The effect is subtle and nicely unifies the look of the watch and its companion iPhone. Like all design upgrades, Liquid Glass made me feel like I was using a new watch — though, like everything, the novelty wore off after a week or two. Revamped Workout app combines AI stats with a DJ In addition to the Buddy, the Workout app has a new look with icons in each of the four corners of the screen that give you easier access to adjust your data view, play music, set goals and tweak Buddy settings. My favorite new feature is in the music menu and it’s limited to Apple Music for now. If you tap the music icon, you have the option to auto-play music. From there, you can also select “Picked for you” or “Choose media.” The former will select music that matches the type of workout you’re doing and what you like to listen to. As someone who gets derailed from pretty much all my tasks when I have to interact with my phone, I appreciate anything that can make decisions for me and prevent me from reaching for it. I was presented with peppy beats that matched the cadence of my run, from bands and artists that were familiar as well as new-to-me selections that fit my tastes. Unfortunately, it didn’t always work correctly. Sometimes I’d get no music, other times the music would play but the Workout Buddy would fall silent. I realize I’m testing a public beta of watchOS 26, so I’m holding out hope the feature will work at launch. Because when it worked, it was glorious. The new Workout app layout. Amy Skorheim for Engadget The new Workout Buddy is probably the biggest AI play in watchOS 26. It uses historical and real-time data collected by your watch to give you a window into how you’re performing at the beginning, end and throughout a workout. It works for walking, running, cycling and other workouts but requires headphones and a nearby Apple Intelligence- compatible iPhone. That gave me pause. I hate carrying stuff and/or sticking things in my ears when I run. But after acquiring some open earbuds and digging out my old Spibelt , I made it work. There are three voices to choose from as of this writing, a bright feminine option, a British male-sounding one and another female-presenting version with a lower register. These were built on vocal data from Fitness+ trainers and have an authentic sound to them. At the start of a workout, you’ll get a brief pep talk along with some recent milestones. My pre-game walking and running talks included references to the day of the week, my location and accumulated fitness data. For example, “Way to get out there on a Wednesday morning walk in Albuquerque. So far this week, you’ve done three walking workouts. Let’s get in some steps!” Depending on the type of exercise, you can set target ranges for cadence, heart rate, speed, distance, power (cycling), time and others. During a workout, the AI will let you know if you’re at, below or above those levels. The first time I tried Workout Buddy, my run was quite lonely. I didn’t realize I had to turn on the Buddy, as well as the various goal metrics within the Workout app. I did that and, on my next run, the AI delivered cadence and heart rate updates, and let me know when I hit milestones like distance and duration. At the end of a workout, you’ll see a thinking animation as the AI assembles a summary. It’ll recap data like your pace, distance, average and peak heart rate, as well as progress on your Activity rings. It’ll also point out comparisons or cumulative milestones you may have hit. For example, after a longer walk, it told me that I’d just burned the most calories on a walk so far. Another day, it told me I’d walked ten miles so far this week. It closes the update by encouraging you to take the energy into the rest of your day or something similarly positive but measured. That’s a big improvement over the first few times I used the feature. My first few pep talks were cloying, telling me something along the lines of “It’s not easy to get out there early in the morning!” and “Your effort is inspiring!\" After I stopped a run early to fuss with settings, it told me I did a “Great job!” on a three-minute run. Thankfully, Apple appears to be tweaking the Buddy behind the scenes, calibrating the AI’s “personality.” Recent pep talks have become noticeably less sycophantic and therefore more enjoyable. I imagine the Buddy will only continue to evolve even more from here. The Workout Buddy is not a coach The Workout Buddy is a motivational experience that provides personalized insights you can use to gauge your performance. But I just finished trying out Samsung’s AI running coach on the Galaxy Watch and couldn’t help comparing the two. That coach pushed me to run five kilometers for the first time in my life. The Buddy made me feel like I’d accomplished something special just by taking my dog on a stroll. Both have their place, but I’d say Apple’s version is probably best for those who already know what their goals are and what they need to do to hit them. Samsung’s version may be better for beginners who want some help shaping their fitness journey. In addition to the Buddy, the Workout app has a new look with icons in each of the four corners of the screen that give you easier access to adjust your data view, play music, set goals and tweak Buddy settings. My favorite new feature is in the music menu and it’s limited to Apple Music for now. If you tap the music icon, you have the option to auto-play music. From there, you can also select “Picked for you” or “Choose media.” The former will select music that matches the type of workout you’re doing and what you like to listen to. As someone who gets derailed from pretty much all my tasks when I have to interact with my phone, I appreciate anything that can make decisions for me and prevent me from reaching for it. I was presented with peppy beats that matched the cadence of my run, from bands and artists that were familiar as well as new-to-me selections that fit my tastes. Unfortunately, it didn’t always work correctly. Sometimes I’d get no music, other times the music would play but the Workout Buddy would fall silent. I realize I’m testing a public beta of watchOS 26, so I’m holding out hope the feature will work at launch. Because when it worked, it was glorious. More hands-free fun with wrist flick I love the double tap gesture Apple introduced with the Apple Watch Series 9 — it’s a pleasure to stop timers, start auto-detected workouts and answer calls without getting my other hand involved. But it took some practice before I could reliably get the watch to recognize the gesture. (The trick is raising your wrist in an exaggerated checking-the-time motion then quickly, but not too quickly, tapping your thumb and finger together twice.) Luckily, the new Wrist Flick motion introduced in watchOS 26 takes practically no effort to get right. It involves quickly turning the back of your wrist away from you and back up again. Doing that can silence a call, stop a ringing timer, dismiss notifications and return you to the watch face from any app you open. It also makes those irritating helpful “Time to stand!” reminders go away. The wrist flick doesn’t clear alerts, just dismisses them — so the red indicator dot disappears, but the notification remains and you can see it if you swipe down. Just note that it’s only available to Apple Watch Series 9, 10 and the Ultra 2. Amy Skorheim for Engadget Wrist flick is a great feature — though it's important to note that Android wearables since WearOS 2 had a similar feature for a while now. And I’d like to see Apple adopt more hands-free interactions like this. Apple already has many gesture-based controls as part of its existing AssistiveTouch feature. Actions like fist clenches, wrist tilts and single or double taps can control most of the navigation on the watch. Unfortunately, turning on AssistiveTouch turns off the universal double tap feature. I’d be interested in seeing something that splits the difference. Perhaps four or five gestures for basic functions that can be used in conjunction with screen input. Smarter replies could make Messages a usable watch app The Apple Watch is great for reading texts, but replying is awkward. That tiny keyboard is an interface for ants — even talk-to-text input is inefficient as it’s tough to correct mistakes. Smart Replies are little canned responses that appear as suggestions below the reply field. Those aren’t new, but now Series 9 watches and later will use an improved on-device language model to come up with relevant bits of text you can send with a tap. In addition to the choices that are always offered — Okay, Yes, No, Thank you and Can I call you later? — I saw things like “Ok, let me know” and “That’s so sweet!” both of which applied to their respective conversations. I wasn’t always given Smart Reply suggestions, and some of them weren’t very relevant, but again, it’s a great feature that will save time when it works. Another Messages update is a carryover from iOS 26 (and borrowed from countless other messaging apps). You can now set custom backgrounds for each of your (Apple-only) contacts. Just note that whatever you set will be seen by all participants in the conversation, once they update to iOS 26. On your watch, the photo, gradient or pattern you pick carries over to your conversations. Not only does it look nice, I find backgrounds help me to not accidentally text my mom something I meant to send to my sister. Backgrounds are now available in Messages. Amy Skorheim for Engadget Notes have arrived The Notes app is now on Apple Watch. I honestly hadn’t noticed the lack before this — I know there are plenty of Notes enthusiasts out there, but in my world, Alexa handles all reminder and shopping list duties. Still, I can see how the new integration could come in handy. After creating a simple shopping checklist in the iOS Notes app, I opened the list on my watch while I was shopping and found it far easier to check things off on my wrist than dragging out my phone every time I stuck something in my cart. I’m curious to see whether Apple’s improved prediction algorithms for the new OS will eventually add Notes to my Smart Stack suggestions after I open the Notes app a few times at the grocery store. As it stands now, the Notes widget will pop up first in the Smart Stack if that’s the last app you used. The rest of the new stuff Face Gallery The iPhone Watch app has a new look and now organizes watch faces by category instead of by name. Groupings include New, Clean, Data-rich, Photos and Health and Fitness, among others. It’s certainly an improvement, but one that makes you wonder why it wasn’t always like this. The Watch Face gallery is categorized now. Amy Skorheim for Engadget Adaptive sound Another nice-but-obvious update adjusts the volume of pings and beeps to fit the environment — quieter in a noiseless office and louder at a raucous BBQ. I set a timer to go off when I was quietly working at my desk and then again with loud music playing and I couldn’t really tell the difference. But that’s a hard metric for the humble human ear to judge. Again, this is a feature reserved for Series 9 models and later. Smart Stack The Smart Stack will now add a small prompt to your watch face when it detects certain situations. For example, if you open the camera app on your phone, a small camera icon appears at the bottom of your watch screen, as a suggestion to open the remote shutter. Apple gives other examples, such as showing the workout icon when you arrive at your usual pilates studio or the Backtrack navigation feature when you journey away from cellular connectivity. I didn’t see the prompt very often, but I did notice that the Smart Stack rearranged itself according to my habits — such as putting the medication widget at the top of the stack right around the time it was time to take my prescription, or shuffling Shazam to the top when it hears music playing. Siri is still Siri Coming fresh off of reviewing the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8, I can’t help but notice a stark difference between that wearable’s fully integrated, AI-powered Gemini and Apple’s same-old Siri. Gemini on the Samsung watch helped me find new stuff in my city, performed convoluted tasks and answered some pretty esoteric questions. I use Siri on my watch to reliably set timers, text people and add events to my calendar. But it’s not quite on the level of Gemini’s contextually-aware, generative capabilities that can interact with multiple apps. Asking something like “Where should I have lunch?” gave me a list of businesses with lunch in the name followed by Siri asking me: “Which one?” Not sure what that meant. Gemini, on the other hand, gave me local and relevant ideas for places I’d actually want to eat. Even before AI swallowed everyone’s mind, I had a soft spot for digital assistants. When Alexa sings the “You’re very, very, oh so very welcome” song, I get a dopey smile on my face. I’ve tried to love Siri, but I get frustrated by being misunderstood, misdirected, misheard and flat-out ignored. I know Apple doesn’t like to release new tech until it’s fully up to snuff, and I’m looking forward to seeing what finally happens with new Siri. But for now, the disparity shows. Wrap-up The changes watchOS 26 brings to the Apple Watch are perhaps not as grand as those for other Apple devices. Liquid Glass here isn’t as all-encompassing as it is on the iPhone . The new watch features don’t make the wearable finally realize its full potential like iPad OS 26 does for the tablet. And there isn’t one major feature upgrade that transforms the watch experience, like macOS 26 does with Spotlight on Macs. But the updates do push the experience of using the watch forward. Liquid Glass is pretty and nicely ties the wearable with its companion devices. The Workout app, which was already good at tracking fitness metrics, is even better with the Workout Buddy, providing stat summaries and automated playlists. Improved smart replies for Messages and the addition of the Notes app fix two of the watch’s previous shortcomings. And the wrist flick adds another option for hands-free interaction and — I hope — is a precursor to more such utility. I’m still holding out hope for an improved, personable and helpful Siri once Apple is ready, but for now, these are all welcome upgrades for what’s already the industry’s best overall smartwatch.

One of the more charming peripherals, the HORI Piranha Plant camera, is on sale right now for only $40. That's $20 off and a record-low price. It's a good deal for anyone who wants to take advantage of the Switch 2's camera functionality in games like Mario Kart World and that recently-released campfire sim . This was designed specifically for Nintendo's new console, so it's a plug-and-play affair. It's actually cheaper than the official Switch 2 camera with this sale and it looks a whole lot cooler. It's a Piranha Plant from the Mario franchise. We called it a \"work of art\" upon encountering the device and that holds true today. This thing is not only stylish, resembling an Amiibo more than a camera, but it's downright useful. The pot the Piranha Plant sits in functions as both a stand and USB extension for the device. The plant itself detaches from the pot, so the camera can be used in portable mode by popping it into the USB port at the top of the console. There's also a built-in privacy shutter. Just close the plant's mouth to obscure the lens. The actual camera specs here aren't going to win any awards, with a frame rate of 30FPS and a resolution of 640 x 480p. However, that's more than enough to capture footage of your floating head to accompany your kart as it races through the Mushroom Kingdom.

Kwon's story is a wild one involving an immense crypto crash , an Interpol manhunt and Kwon's eventual extradition from Montenegro to the United States. Kwon, along with Sam Bankman-Fried and others, was a key player in 2022's crypto collapse . His company Terraform created a \"stablecoin\" called TerraUSD supposedly pegged to the US dollar, along with a floating crypto coin called Luna. When TerraUSD fell below its $1 peg in May of 2021, Kwon secretly arranged for a trading firm to buy the currency to boost its price. However, he lied to investors and said he stabilized the coin using a specialized algorithm. Those investors believed the story and bought up Luna (closely tied to TerraUSD), to the tune of nearly $50 billion, according to US prosecutors. Both currencies subsequently collapsed, taking $40 billion of investor money with it. As it often works with such things, many regular people lost their life savings , while venture capital firms profited before the rug was pulled. Following the collapse, Kwon was put on wanted lists in both the US and South Korea, with investigators in the latter country enlisting Interpol to find the entrepreneur. He subsequently posted on X that he \"wasn't on the run\" and was extradited to the US last year on New Year's Eve. Kwon was originally charged with nine counts including securities fraud, wire fraud, commodities fraud and money-laundering conspiracy. Though facing up to 25 years, he may receive a reduced sentence of 12 years maximum provided he accepts responsibility for his crimes. \"I made false and misleading statements about why [TerraUSD] regained its peg by failing to disclose a trading firm’s role in restoring that peg,” Kwon said. “What I did was wrong.” Earlier, Kwon agreed to pay an $80 million civil fine and be banned from crypto transactions as part of a $4.55 billion US Securities and Exchange Commission settlement. Prosecutors will allow Kwon to be transferred to South Korea after half his US sentence is served.

If you're looking to upgrade from an old pair or want a fresh set for the new school year, you can pick up the AirPods Pro 2 for $169 right now. That's 32 percent off their usual price and one of the best prices we've seen this year. Apple’s flagship AirPods were $100 off — a record-low $149 — during Prime Day, so we have seen them even cheaper than this, but for a non-sale period, Amazon’s current deal is worth considering. The AirPods Pro 2 are our top choice for iPhone users looking for wireless earbuds, thanks to much beefier sound than the original model, rock solid ANC and transparency modes, and seamless switching between Apple devices. Throw in spatial audio support, hands-free Siri and more than acceptable battery life, and the AirPods Pro 2 are hard to top. Not everyone gets on with the sometimes fiddly touch gestures, but a lot of wireless headphones struggle with this. If there’s anything to give you pause, it’s that we might be getting the AirPods Pro 3 sooner rather than later. But if that’s the case, you can be confident you’ll pay a lot more than $169 for the privilege. The AirPods Pro aren’t the only discounted AirPods right now. The AirPods 4 (without ANC) are down to $99. Usually priced at $129, you’re saving $30 on a much improved entry-level AirPods offering. They fit and sound better than any non-Pro AirPods before them, and inherit some previously Pro-only features thanks to the H2 chip. If you travel a lot you’ll also certainly rue the lack of ANC, but if that isn’t a deal breaker for you, the $99 price point might be tempting.

The Netflix animated film has become a global hit since it launched on the platform and has reportedly become the second most-watched movie on the service's history after Red Notice . Now, Netflix is holding a limited theatrical event, wherein fans can watch a sing-along version of the film. Aside from the movie itself being a hit, its songs have gained massive popularity, with the track Golden recently taking the number one spot on the Billboard Hot 100. KPop Demon Hunters is a musical that revolves around the girl group Huntr/x, which as you might have guessed, are demon hunters. The group is the latest trio of women who uses the power of their singing voices to maintain the Honmoon, or the magical barrier that prevents demons from entering our world established generations ago by the first trio of singing demon hunters. In the film, they're in constant competition with a boy band called Saja Boys, who are made up of demons that look like pretty boys. The main antagonist, however, is Gwi-Ma, ruler of the demons. He was voiced by Lee Byung-hun, whom a lot of people might know as the Front Man in Squid Game. The film's limited theatrical release will only last for one weekend, from August 23 to 24, in select screens across the US and Canada. You can buy tickets starting today, August 13, at 9AM Eastern time, from the even't official website , where you can also view the full list of theaters and showtimes in your area.

The startup, called Merge Labs, will use AI for its brain-computer interface and compete directly with Neuralink, along with other nascent companies in the field like Precision Neuroscience and Synchron. The name Merge Labs comes from a term Altman used in 2017 called \"the merge\" that describes the moment human brains and computers come together. The company will raise funds, most from OpenAI's ventures team, that will set its valuation at $850 million. Altman will co-found Merge Labs with Alex Blania (from World, an eyeball scanning company also backed by OpenAI) but won't invest any capital himself, according to three people with direct knowledge of the project. Altman has been interested in the topic of machine-brain interfaces for years and suggested in the 2017 article above that the merge could arrive as soon as 2025 (it didn't). More recently, he wrote in another blog post a \"high-bandwidth brain-computer interface\" could soon be developed with the aid of recent tech advances. Altman's Merge Labs will be a direct competitor to Musk's Neuralink, intensifying the rivalry between the two that kicked off when Musk left OpenAI's board in 2018. Mind link technology has existed for decades now , but recent advances in implant tech and AI have allowed researchers to collect and process higher signal levels from the brain. Neuralink started its first human trials in January 2024 with quadriplegic subject Noland Arbaugh and later implanted its tech into a second anonymous subject. That subject, \"Alex,\" has reportedly been able to play FPS games and create 3D designs, while suffering from fewer issues and side effects as Arbaugh.

In a post on X , OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has revealed that the chatbot's model picker now comes with three GPT-5 choices: Auto, Fast and Thinking.

But users will be able to choose the fast-responding version or the Thinking version that implies it delivers longer, more comprehensive answers if they want to. GPT-4o is now also back in the model picker for all paying users by default. OpenAI removed GPT-4o with the launch of GPT-5: The company significantly simplified ChatGPT because GPT-5 was supposed to offer a unified experience for users. However, its decision was met by criticism from people who preferred GPT-4o's personality better, especially since it didn't give them notice that it was deprecating older models. In his post, Altman promised users that if the company ever does deprecate GPT-4o, OpenAI \"will give plenty of notice.\" In addition to the GPT-5 and GPT-4o models, users can toggle to \"Show additional models\" in ChatGPT web settings if they want to access o3, 4.1, and GPT-5 Thinking mini. GPT-4.5 is only available to subscribers paying for the $200-a-month Pro tier, though, because it \"costs a lot of GPUs.\" Altman said that GPT-5 Thinking now has rate limits of 3,000 messages a week, after which users will only be able to use GPT-5 Thinking mini. He has also revealed that OpenAI is working to update GPT-5's personality to make it warmer, but \"not as annoying (to most users) as GPT-4o.\" Updates to ChatGPT: You can now choose between “Auto”, “Fast”, and “Thinking” for GPT-5. Most users will want Auto, but the additional control will be useful for some people.

Razer is now catering to those folks with two new PC gamepads, the wireless Wolverine V3 Pro 8K PC and wired Wolverine V3 Tournament Edition 8K PC . The key feature is right there in the names, with 8,000Hz polling speeds that promise high responsiveness for demanding pro or serious players. The Wolverine V3 Pro 8K PC offers 8,000Hz polling in both wired and wireless modes, meaning player inputs are recognized nearly instantly. By contrast, Razer's Wolverine V3 Pro designed for Xbox and PC (which we liked) tops out at just 1,000Hz. The V3 Pro 8K PC model also uses Tunnel Magnetoresistance (TMR) thumbsticks with swappable caps for long life, consistent tension and superior anti-drift performance over time. That model is also Razer's lightest wireless esports controller yet and features an ergonomic shape to reduce hand fatigue. Other features include 4 mouse click back buttons and 2 claw grip bumpers, Razer Pro HyperTriggers, Mecha-Tactile PBT Action Buttons, an 8-way floating D-Pad and Razer's Synapse customization. It comes with a carrying case and 2m braided cable and is now available for $200. Razer also launched a wired-only model called the Wolverine V3 Tournament Edition PC. It offers most of the same features, like the 8,000Hz HyperPolling tech, TMR anti-drift thumbsticks, HyperTriggers, Mecha-Tactile PBT buttons and Synapse customization. It also comes with a 2m braided cable and is now available for $120 — a very reasonable price for a competition-level gamepad.

In particular, the Tracing system fixes the slotsMissed_int metric, while networking improvements include Windows socket fixes, reduced caching time of DNS lookup errors, refined PeerSharing configuration behavior (see networking changes below for details), and the deprecation of --non-producer-node in favor of --start-as-non-producer-node command line switch for starting the node. This release also removes a number of irrelevant binaries from the Node artifacts and adds tx-generator . Benchmarking reports relevant to the 10.5.1 release can be found in this post on Cardano Updates . System testing results for the 10.5.1 release can be found on the corresponding tag testing page . Please note the changed default behavior for PeerSharing for relay nodes, but not for block producers. This reflects the recommendations for mainnet usage -- mainnet block producers may not meet the Praos performance guarantees if PeerSharing is enabled and IP will also be leaked, but this is not an issue for relays. Known issues There is a known bug when starting from a Byron snapshot. The node will reject the snapshot and replay the chain from the start. However the time it takes to replay the Byron era is small, and very few users are expected to need to start the node from a Byron snapshot. Therefore the issue will be fixed in 10.6.0.

For this purpose, the node is considered a BP if any of the protocol files are present at startup. The default can be overridden by explicitly setting the PeerSharing key in the configuration file to the desired value.

Rachel Reeves’s metaphor in her Mansion House speech last month about regulation in too many areas acting as “a boot on the neck of business” felt wildly over the top when you remember why tougher financial rules were needed in the banking sector in the first place. It was because the light-touch regulatory era caused the whole economy to be clobbered in the collapses of 2008-09. In the event, it took until 2019 to implement fully the centrepiece of the clean-up operation: bank ringfencing, which requires UK banks of a certain size to separate their retail and investment banking activities. Now, six years later – no time at all in the grand scheme – the Treasury, lobbied by most of the big banks, is contemplating “meaningful” changes to ringfencing in the interests of economic growth .

A contemporary reworking would need to start from a radically different premise.

In an earlier post on X that's currently pinned to the top of his profile, however, he tagged Apple, asking the company why it \"[refuses] to put either X or Grok in [its] \"Must Have\" section. He said X is \"the #1 news app in the world,\" while Grok is ranked number five among all apps. \"Are you playing politics? What gives?\" he continued.

Our goal is to offer safe discovery for users and valuable opportunities for developers, collaborating with many to increase app visibility in rapidly evolving categories.\" Meanwhile, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman posted a response to Musk's accusation on X, calling it a \"remarkable claim,\" given that he has heard allegations that Musk manipulates \"X to benefit himself and his own companies and harm his competitors and people he doesn't like.\" To note, Chinese AI chatbot DeepSeek became the top-rated free app on Apple's App Store back in January, overtaking even ChatGPT. Apple is behaving in a manner that makes it impossible for any AI company besides OpenAI to reach #1 in the App Store, which is an unequivocal antitrust violation. xAI will take immediate legal action. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) August 12, 2025 While Musk didn't mention it, Apple has an ongoing partnership with OpenAI. The company has integrated ChatGPT into Apple Intelligence to power cloud-based queries for its platforms. More recently, the company said that Apple Intelligence will leverage the capabilities of OpenAI's GPT-5 in iOS 26, iPadOS 26 and macOS Tahoe 26, which are set to arrive sometime in September.

In a statement sent to Bloomberg , Apple said the App Store is \"designed to be fair and free of bias.\" The company's spokesperson explained that the App Store features \"thousands of apps through charts, algorithmic recommendations and curated lists selected by experts using objective criteria.\" They added: \"Our goal is to offer safe discovery for users and valuable opportunities for developers, collaborating with many to increase app visibility in rapidly evolving categories.\" xAI founder Elon Musk accused Apple of \"unequivocal antitrust violation\" by favoring OpenAI in a post on X, warning that his company \"will take immediate legal action.\" In a separate post from his threat, he asked Apple why it \"[refuses] to put either X or Grok in [its] 'Must Have' section.\" X, he said, is \"the #1 news app in the world,\" while Grok is ranked number five among all apps. \"Are you playing politics? What gives?\" he continued. Musk didn't provide evidence to back his accusations. It's also worth noting that Chinese AI app DeepSeek reached the top of Apple's free app rankings back in January, overtaking even ChatGPT. As X's own Community Notes also mentioned in Musk's post, added hours after it went up, Perplexity reached the top of overall rankings in India's App Store back in July. Both apps were able to reach the top of their respective lists way after Apple and OpenAI announced their partnership last year. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman responded to Musk's accusation, as well. He said it's a \"remarkable claim,\" given that he has heard allegations that Musk manipulates \"X to benefit himself and his own companies and harm his competitors and people he doesn't like.\" In response, Musk posted : \"Scam Altman lies as easily as he breathes.\" Apple is behaving in a manner that makes it impossible for any AI company besides OpenAI to reach #1 in the App Store, which is an unequivocal antitrust violation. xAI will take immediate legal action. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) August 12, 2025 This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/apple-says-the-app-store-is-fair-and-free-of-bias-in-response-to-musks-legal-threats-235555807.html?src=rss", "ingested_utc": "2025-08-14T21:04:43Z", "retrieved_utc": "2025-08-14T21:04:43Z"}

The settlement fee will be used to provide redress to injured customers of Match Group's dating services, which include Match.com, Tinder, Hinge, OkCupid, and PlentyOfFish. The agency sued Match Group in 2019 on a series of allegations. According to the complaint, the dating service company had used misleading ads to encourage subscriptions and then made it difficult for customers to cancel those subscriptions. Match Group was also accused of locking customers out of their accounts when they attempted to dispute billing charges. In addition to the payment, Match Group has agreed to clearly and conspicuously disclose the terms of its \"six-month guarantee,\" as well as any conditions or limitations to those offers. It will also offer simple mechanisms for customers to cancel their subscriptions. Finally, Match Group will not retaliate or take action against customers who file billing disputes, and it won't deny those customers access to paid-for services or goods. Match Group also drew scrutiny earlier this year after an investigation claimed that it had failed to act on reports of sexual assault and made little effort to keep abusive or dangerous users from rejoining other dating platforms it owns.

Members of the team will become members of the Communication Workers of America and Microsoft has recognized the union. The SFD team is responsible for cinematics, animation and narrative in Blizzard's series, creating content such as in-game cutscenes and promotional videos. The department also includes archival workers and historians for Blizzard franchises, such as World of Warcraft and Overwatch . A spokesperson from CWA said that there will be about 169 workers from the company joining the local chapter. \"After more than a decade working at Blizzard, I've seen all the highs and lows. For years, Blizzard has been a place where people could build their careers and stay for decades, but that stability's been fading,\" Bucky Fisk, a principal editor and member of the organizing committee, said. \"With a union, we're able to preserve what makes this place special, secure real transparency in how decisions are made, and make sure policies are applied fairly to everyone.\" \"These past couple of months have felt both important and cathartic given what's happened to video game workers across the industry,\" said Sammi Kay, another member of the organizing committee and an associate producer at Blizzard. \"At multiple points in my life, I've always been told to accept the way things are, but with organizing, we're able to build a future better than we found it.\" Blizzard is owned by Microsoft. Today's development marks the latest move for game developers under the tech giant's umbrella to pursue union representation. About 600 quality assurance workers from Activision joined CWA last March. The QA team from ZeniMax also ratified its union agreement in June and Raven Software finally secured a union contract earlier this month.

Topshop, once a rite of passage for young women finding their style on the high street, was bought by Asos in 2021 when its parent company, Philip Green’s Arcadia, went into administration. But its flagship store, the 90,000-sq-ft (8,400 sq metres) shopping destination at Oxford Circus in central London, closed later that year and the brand’s relevance diminished. The Danish billionaire Anders Holch Povlsen, who bought a 75% stake in the company last year, is hoping to change that.

The FDIC has taken several actions to further that objective, and soon, we plan to issue a rulemaking that would prohibit examiners from criticizing institutions on the basis of reputational risk or directing or encouraging institutions to close accounts on the basis of political, social, religious, or other views. Consistent with the Executive Order, the FDIC also plans to review whether FDIC-supervised institutions have engaged in politicized or unlawful debanking. The FDIC looks forward to working with our interagency partners to ensure that all law-abiding individuals and businesses have access to bank accounts, and that the era of debanking politically disfavored customers is over. # # # MEDIA CONTACT: mediarequests@fdic.gov The FDIC does not send unsolicited email.

These banks were required to submit resolution plans by July 1, 2025. Resolution plans, commonly known as living wills, are required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. These plans describe a banking organization’s strategy for orderly resolution under bankruptcy in the event of material financial distress or failure. By regulation, resolution plans must be divided into public and confidential sections. To foster transparency, the agencies have required each banking organization’s public section to summarize certain elements of the resolution plan. In addition, the FDIC released public sections of the separate resolution plans of 12 large insured depository institutions (IDIs), which are required under the FDIC’s IDI Rule. These IDI resolution plans, which were also required to be submitted by July 1, 2025, are designed to enable the FDIC to efficiently resolve an IDI under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act in the event of its failure. The public sections of the resolution plans are available on the FDIC's and the Board’s websites. # # # MEDIA CONTACT: Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Carroll Kim (202) 898-7389 Federal Reserve Board Karolina Kalset (202) 898-7389 The FDIC does not send unsolicited email.

The list covers evaluation ratings that the FDIC assigned to institutions in May 2025. The CRA is a 1977 law that requires the FDIC to assess a bank’s record of meeting the credit needs of its entire community, including those of low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with safe and sound operations. As part of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA), Congress mandated the public disclosure of an evaluation and rating for each bank or thrift that undergoes a CRA examination on or after July 1, 1990. You may obtain a consolidated list of all state nonmember banks whose evaluations have been made publicly available since July 1, 1990, including the rating for each bank, or obtain a hard copy from FDIC's Public Information Center, 3501 Fairfax Drive, Room E-1002, Arlington, VA 22226 (877-275-3342 or 703-562-2200). A copy of an individual bank's CRA evaluation is available directly from the bank, which is required by law to make the material available upon request, or from the FDIC's Public Information Center.
