    "summary": "Sony's WH-1000XM5 once topped our lists of best noise-canceling headphones and best wireless headphones , and were only usurped by the follow-up XM6 . This line of headphones is consistently impressive and the WH-1000XM is truly in a league of its own . So we get excited when one of the all-around best headphones out there goes on an aggressive sale. You can pick up a pair of XM5s right now for just $274, which is 32 percent off its normal retail price of $400. In our review of the XM5 we awarded a score of 95 out of 100, impressed with just about every aspect of the set with the notable exception of its price, which makes a sale like this all the more exciting. The XM5s are supremely comfortable, thanks to a slim cushioned headband and soft earcups. In our review, we had no problem wearing them for hours at a time and never felt uncomfortable pressure on the ears or head. 30mm carbon-fiber drivers deliver excellent audio, delivering a wide and immersive soundstage. The XM5 carries eight total microphones as part of its active noise-canceling system, up from four on the previous model , and delivers top-of-class ANC. The battery life on these headphones is best in class, with around 30 hours of listening per charge. Touch controls on the outside panel of the right ear cup help you control your music with ease, allowing you to play, pause, skip tracks and adjust the volume right from the headphones. The only real downside at this point is you’re buying a pair of headphones that are three years old; the XM6 offers some noteworthy improvements. But, of course, it’ll cost you. If you've been thinking about upgrading your headphones, or picking up your first pair of real high-quality cans, then take advantage of these savings. The sale price of $274 applies to the black model only, though the other colors are 18 percent off, selling for $328. Follow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice .

We must make sure that these inequalities are addressed for future generations. That’s why reviving the pensions commission – bringing together unions, employers and independent experts – is a vital step forward. We’re determined to close the gender pensions gap, and the new state pension has already reduced historic inequalities faced by women and low earners. Alongside this, the pensions commission will tackle barriers to close the gender pensions gap in private pensions to ensure women have the dignity and security they deserve in retirement.

    "summary": "Sennheiser's most expensive Ambeo soundbar is getting a substantial update. The company announced that the Ambeo Soundbar Max , a $2,000 beast of a living room speaker, will gain two features it calls Customizable Immersion and Voice Enhancement Mode. Plus, the company is adding lossless audio support on top of Dolby Atmos Music. The firmware update will equip the Max with Ambeo OS2 and is available via free download through the Sennheiser Smart Control app for iOS and Android. With Customizable Immersion, Sennheiser will give users the ability to adjust volume levels for side, top and center channel virtualization. The company says this will allow customers to tailor the immersion to their preferences or to the content they're watching. As you might expect, Voice Enhancement Mode boosts dialogue to ensure it remains clear when sound effects or music would otherwise overpower the mix in movies, TV shows or during sports events. The Ambeo Soundbar Max already offered support for spatial audio for tunes via Dolby Atmos Music, but now the living room speaker will allow you to play lossless audio too. Sennheiser says you can expect up to 24-bit/96kHz through Google Cast and up to 24-bit/192kHz from Tidal Connect. The Ambeo Soundbar Max originally arrived in 2019 as the Ambeo Soundbar. Sennheiser changed the name when it expanded the Ambeo Soundbar lineup, which now includes the mid-sized Plus and compact Mini options. The Max was $2,500 at launch before rising to $3,000, but the company is now selling it's biggest home theater unit for $2,000. That may seem like a lot for one piece of your setup, but Sennheiser promises the combination of bass performance and Ambeo tech means you won't need a separate subwoofer or rear satellite speakers. Those claims held up during my review of the soundbar back when it debuted.

    "summary": "The HORI Piranha Plant camera for the Nintendo Switch 2 is on sale for just $40 , which is a discount of $20 and a record-low price. This is a great deal for those who own a Switch 2 and want to take advantage of the camera functionality in games like Mario Kart World and that recently-released campfire sim . This was designed specifically for Nintendo's new console, so it's a plug-and-play affair. It's actually cheaper than the official Switch 2 camera with this sale and it looks a whole lot cooler. It's a Piranha Plant from the Mario franchise. We called it a \"work of art\" upon encountering the device and that holds true today. This thing is not only stylish, resembling an Amiibo more than a camera, but it's downright useful. The pot the Piranha Plant sits in functions as both a stand and USB extension for the device. The plant itself detaches from the pot, so the camera can be used in portable mode by popping it into the USB port at the top of the console. There's also a built-in privacy shutter. Just close the plant's mouth to obscure the lens. The actual camera specs here aren't going to win any awards, with a frame rate of 30FPS and a resolution of 640 x 480p. However, that's more than enough to capture footage of your floating head to accompany your kart as it races through the Mushroom Kingdom.

    "summary": "Masimo, the medical technology company whose lawsuit led to the temporary sales pause of the Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2, has sued the US Customs and Border Protection days after Apple released its redesigned blood oxygen monitoring feature. This is just the latest update in the lengthy legal saga between Masimo and Apple, which started when the former sued the iPhonemaker in 2021, accusing it of infringing on several of its light-based blood oxygen monitoring patents. After a court sided with Masimo in 2023, Apple was forced to stop selling the Watch Series 9 and the Ultra 2 in the US for a few weeks. In order to circumvent the import ban for the devices, Apple removed the Blood Oxygen app for the watch models sold in the US. Just a few days ago, however, the company introduced a \"redesigned Blood Oxygen feature\" for the Watch Series 9, Series 10 and Watch Ultra 2 models. The feature works by measuring and calculating data from the watches' sensors on their paired iPhones instead. Users will then be able to view their blood oxygen data in the Respiratory section of the Health app. Apple said the update was \"enabled by a recent US Customs ruling.\" But Masimo said in its complaint (via Bloomberg Law ) that it only heard about the ruling, which was handed down on August 1, when Apple made the announcement. It argued that the agency typically requires both sides to be heard before making such decisions and that Customs \"exceeded its authority.\" Masimo is now asking the court to put an injunction on UCBP's decision and, ultimately, to only allow imports of the devices if their blood oxygen-tracking function is disabled. \"Each passing day that this unlawful ruling remains in effect irreparably deprives Masimo of its right to be free from unfair trade practices and to preserve its competitive standing in the US marketplace,\" Masimo said.

    "summary": "Chinese action camera (and now drone ) company Insta360 has unveiled a premium addition to its lineup of compact cameras. The Insta360 GO Ultra is being billed as a new, more powerful product line in the GO series, instead of a replacement for the GO 3S . This next generation represents a substantial step up in performance, powered by a new 5nm AI chip, which is a big jump from the 14nm chip found on the GO 3S. It also benefits from a larger 1/1.28-inch sensor, roughly twice the size of the one in the 3S. All of this unlocks better image quality with support for HDR, 4K capture at 60 fps and double the frame rate of the 3S. The Ultra also offers PureVideo, an enhancement that uses AI-powered algorithms to reduce noise and increase brightness in low-light captures. The form factor for the Ultra is largely the same as the 3S, with a compact camera body that can be optionally housed in an Action Pod that offers additional battery life and a 2.5-inch flip touchscreen for live camera view. The Ultra weighs 53 grams (around 1.9 ounces), 14 grams more than the 3S, and sports a square body, as opposed to the pill-like shape of the 3S. The slightly larger body means a 70-minute standalone battery life, which is just over 80 percent more than the 38 minutes on the 3S. The Action Pod extends this to 200 minutes. The Ultra also offers removable storage, expandable up to 2TB. Like most Insta360 cameras , much of the design is geared toward action shots for the more adventurous among us. The GO Ultra's IPX8 rating means it's waterproof down to 33 feet underwater. A magnetic clip system makes it easy to attach the GO Ultra to a piece of clothing or equipment and start capturing your adventure in 4K. The Insta360 GO Ultra is available now worldwide for $450.

    "summary": "The last thing anyone wants at the end of a long day is to look down at their phone and see its battery almost dead. One way to avoid that is to keep a compact power bank on you at all times, and it's arguably easiest to do that with one like Anker's 621 MagGo portable battery . This sleek, 5K magnetic brick attaches to the back of your iPhone to power it up, even while you're still using it. Now, it's on sale for 30 percent off — you can pick up any of five coloways for only $28 a pop. This is a thin and light device, so it's perfect for pockets, purses, backpacks and just about anywhere else. It charges up via an included USB-C cable. As a warning, the Anker 621 MagGo requires a magnetic connection via the smartphone itself or a magnetic case. It won't work with non-magnetic cases. It also runs a bit hot, reaching internal temperatures of up to 118 F, which could be something to keep an eye on during use. Follow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice .

    "summary": "Chinese regulators reportedly dissuaded local companies from purchasing NVIDIA's H20 chips, because they found certain statements by US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick \"insulting.\" According to the Financial Times , the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC), the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) and the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) teamed up to intensify their efforts to push the use of homegrown chips following Lutnick's remarks in an interview with CNBC . The US, if you'll recall, blocked NVIDIA from selling its H20 chips to China back in April out of concern that the Chinese military would use them to develop AI technology. When the US government reversed its decision in July and allowed the company to start shipping its chips to China, Lutnick told CNBC : \"We don't sell them our best stuff, not our second best stuff, not even our third best. The fourth one down, we want to keep China using it... The idea is the Chinese are more than capable of building their own. You want to keep one step ahead of what they can build, so they keep buying our chips. You want to sell the Chinese enough that their developers get addicted to the American technology stack. That's the thinking.\" To note, a previous Times report stated that the government allowed NVIDIA to ship its products to China again after agreeing to hand over 15 percent of its profits. As a response to Lutnick's remarks, the Times says Chinese authorities sought ways to prevent local companies from buying H20 chips. CAC issued an informal notice instructing China's biggest tech firms, such as ByteDance and Alibaba, to stop new orders for H20 chips until the government is done conducting a national security review. The companies are compelled to comply, because they could face substantial fines from the CAC if they don't. Meanwhile, NDRC also issued an informal notice, asking local tech companies not to purchase any NVIDIA chip. Reuters recently reported that NVIDIA is developing a new chip for the Chinese market that's more powerful than the H20, perhaps driven in part by China's move to discourage its purchase. It will be based on the company's Blackwell architecture, but will only be capable of half the computing power of NVIDIA's Blackwell Ultra GPUs. Their regulatory and export approval aren't guaranteed, but the president previously implied that he was aware of the project and said he expects NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang to talk to him about it.

    "summary": "There are dozens of VPNs to choose from, but to think they're all created equally would be a mistake. Some are better than others, and NordVPN sits squarely in the better category. Now, you can save up to 77 percent on most of NordVPN's plans. Arguably the best plan for most people is the NordVPN Plus plan , which you can get two years of access for only $108 right now. That's 73 percent off the usual rate, and NordVPN throws in an addition three months for free, so you're actually getting a 27-month subscription for the sale price. As well as Nord’s VPN service, a Plus plan also includes the Threat Protection Pro anti-malware tool, password management and an ad- and tracker-blocker. A Prime plan additionally comes with encrypted cloud storage or NordProtect, which insures you against identity theft and monitors dark web activity. That's also on sale — down to $189 on the same two-year commitment with those three additional months thrown in, which works out to a 77 percent savings on the regular price. When Engadget’s Sam Chapman reviewed NordVPN earlier this year, he praised its excellent download speeds, exclusive features and extensive server network. Less impressive is its clunky interface and inconsistent design when jumping between different platforms running a NordVPN app. While it doesn't quite make the cut in our guide to the best VPNs available right now, it generally performed well in speed tests and Threat Protection Pro is really worth having.

    "summary": "If you’ve been shocked by how much you spend on streaming services lately, you’re not alone. Companies like Netflix, Disney, Max and others have been consistently raising prices to the point where you may question if streaming is even worth it anymore . We at Engadget still think it is, but we also think you should be smart with your money — and that’s where streaming deals come in. Yes, it is possible to get discounts on services like Peacock and Paramount+, even if those deals aren’t as common as a sale on AirPods. If you’re looking to save money and still stream all of the content you want, Engadget can help by laying out the best streaming deals you can get right now, how you can save with bundles and everything you should know before paying for yet another streaming service. Best streaming deals True streaming deals can be hard to come by. Most often, they’ll pop up during the Black Friday shopping period. On occasion, we’ll see them sparingly throughout the year and they usually take the form of a discounted monthly or annual rate for a limited period of time. Also, true streaming deals are typically on the ad-supported versions of a service, but once in a while you’ll find a unicorn of a deal on a tier that has ad-free viewing. If you’re able to wait for a deal before subscribing to a streaming service, we recommend doing so. You’ll save money upfront and in the long run, and you also have the option to cancel your subscription before the price goes back up to the normal rate. Maybe you find you like the service so much that you’re fine paying full price for it — that’s the ideal situation. But if you’re not compelled to keep that app on rotation in your smart TV, most streaming services make it easy for you to cancel at any time. With that said, these are the best streaming deals you can snag right now. DirecTV starting at $50/month for one month ($35 off): All of DirecTV's signature packages are $35 off right now for your first month when you sign up. If you opt for the base \"Entertainment\" package, you'll spend $50 for the first month and get access to over 90 channels, including many local stations as well as ESPN, ESPN 2 and Fox Sports 1. You'll also be able to watch on the go with the DirecTV mobile app. DashPass Annual + HBO Max (with ads) for $96/year ($144 off): This offer includes access to HBO Max with ads for no extra cost when you sign up for a DashPass Annual plan. You can then decide to upgrade to Max Standard, which removes ads, for a discounted rate of $11 monthly if you want. Aside from the obvious streaming benefits, this deal gives you $0 deliver fees and lower service fees on some restaurant DoorDash orders, five percent DoorDash credits on pickup orders, on-demand grocery delivery and other members-only exclusives. Spotify Premium Individual (3 month) for $0 ($36 off): This is our favorite music streaming service for podcasts and social features. Right now, users who have not signed up for Spotify's Premium service before are eligible to get three months for free. The Premium Individual plan lets you listen ad-free and skip songs at will. You can also organize your listening queue and download content for offline listening. Just be aware, your subscription will auto-renew at the end of the trial period. So if you don't want to be on the hook for the $12 monthly fee, set a reminder to cancel and go back to the free version. Fubo Pro for $55/month for the first month ($30 off): Fubo has introductory discounts on most of its packages, and the Pro package is the least expensive plan currently listed. It offers access to 224 channels, unlimited cloud DVR and up to 10 simultaneous streams. It even includes regional sports content from the NHL, MLB and NBA. YouTube TV (three months) for $150 ($99 off) : You can get three months of our favorite live TV streaming service for $50 per month. That should give you a decent chunk of time to see if the service is right for you while saving some cash. The discount and trial are only open to new subscribers to YouTube TV’s base plan, which includes access to over 100 channels, unlimited DVR space and six household accounts with the ability to stream on three devices at once. Sling Orange for $23/month for the first month (50 percent off): New customers can get Sling Orange or Sling Blue for half off the usual price for the first month, bringing the final prices to $23/month and $25.50/month, respectively. Orange is likely best for sports fans, with eight exclusive sports and family channels, while Blue includes 19 exclusive news and entertainment channels. You can get both Orange and Blue access also for half off for one month, or $33 total. Peacock first responders discount — one year for $48 (50 percent off) : Medical professionals and first responders can save 50 percent each year of Peacock. The deal requires annual verification and is open to those who work for either private or public institutions. Peacock has some great stuff to watch, including Poker Face and Killing It and more . Student discounts on streaming services HBO Max student discount — subscribe for $5/month (50 percent off): HBO Max offers their ad-supported tier to students for half off the usual rate. You’ll just have to verify that you’re a student through Unidays , and make note that this offer is only good for up to 12 months of service. Hulu student discount — subscribe for $2/month (75 percent off): Those with a valid student ID can get Hulu’s ad-supported tier for 75 percent off the typical rate. They’ll keep the same sale price for as long as they’re a student as well. Spotify student discount — Premium + Hulu with ads for $6/month (72 percent off): Spotify’s student offer continues to be one of the best around, giving you access to the Premium tier of the music streamer and Hulu’s ad-supported plan for only $6 monthly. Purchased separately, you’d pay $22 per month for both of the services. Plus, the first month is free when you sign up. NBA League Pass student discount — one year for $120 (40 percent off) : Students can get one year of League Pass for only $10 per month, which includes access to NBA TV and the ability to watch classic and archive games on-demand. On the NBA League Pass website, look for the student discount banner at the top and follow the instructions to verify your student status. Streaming bundle discounts There’s more consolidation happening now than ever before in the streaming space, and that means there are more streaming bundle options. These bundles offer you access to more content with one subscription price, but those prices are typically higher than paying for a single service by itself (obviously). It may be tempting to just get the bundle, but if only one of those services in the bundle speaks to you, you’ll spend less overall by just paying for the single service. Speaking of a deep love for a single streaming service: if all of your favorite shows are on Peacock or the latest releases on HBO Max consistently bring you joy, consider paying for one year upfront. Subscribing with an annual plan usually saves you money in the long term over paying on a monthly basis. Unfortunately, not all streaming services (looking at you, Netflix) have an annual subscription option. Here are some of the best streaming bundles you can get right now. Disney+, Hulu, HBO Max bundle with ads for $17/month : Ad-supported HBO Max is included here, along with full, ad-supported access to Disney+ and Hulu. You’ll save 43 percent with this bundle, as opposed to paying for all three services individually. Disney+ and Hulu Bundle Premium for $20/month : Disney and Hulu offer a few different bundles, which you can view in the drop-down lists under Choose Your Plan. This bundle removes the ads from both Disney+ and Hulu (with the exception of select live and linear content) and allows you to download content for offline viewing. You’ll save 42 percent with this bundle, as opposed to paying for both ad-free tiers individually. Hulu + Live TV with Disney+ and ESPN+ for $96/month: This streaming bundle amalgamation is a bit confusing but it does offer a lot: you get live TV streaming via Hulu’s service plus access to the following VOD services: Hulu, Disney+ and ESPN+. Out of those three, only ESPN+ will have ads. Disney+, Hulu, ESPN+ Bundle Basic for $17/month : You get full access to Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ content with this package, albeit with ads across the board. This bundle price is 46 percent off the total price of all three separate subscriptions. Disney+, Hulu, ESPN+ Bundle Premium for $27/month : Similarly to the Duo bundles, the Premium version of the Trio removes ads from most content in Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+, and you can download content for offline viewing. This price represents a 43-percent savings when compared to paying for all three ad-free tiers separately. Sling TV + HBO Max starting at $53/month: Sling TV and HBO Max have partnered on a discount that gives new subscribers 50 percent off their first month of Sling TV, plus $5 off monthly when you subscribe to the Sling TV + HBO Max bundle. The standard price for the Sling Blue + HBO Max duo is roughly $58/month, so you'll get a monthly discount of $5 off that. In addition, for the first month only, you'll get half off the price of the bundle. The promotion also applies to the Sling Orange & Blue + HBO Max package, which has a standard price of $73/month. Paramount+ with Showtime for $13/month or $120/year : This includes everything in Paramount+’s Essential plan, except the ads, and also provides access to Showtime content, live CBS streams and download features.

    "summary": "In-flight internet is crappy, but more and more airlines think that Starlink is the solution. The latest company to sign with the SpaceX affiliate is Alaska Air Group, which announced that it will start offering Starlink Wi-Fi next year and expand the service to its entire fleet by 2027. \"With Starlink already live on [Alaska Air Group subsidiary] Hawaiian Airlines, we're proud that we'll offer... gate-to-gate connectivity on nearly every aircraft across both airlines,\" CEO Ben Minicucci said in a statement. The company noted in a separate announcement that it will offer the perk for free to members of its new loyalty program called Atmos Rewards . T-Mobile, a partner with Alaska, will also offer a \"seamless, ad-free Wi-Fi log-on\" to the in-flight Starlink service, with more details to be announced later this year. Alaska Air touted the benefits of \"ultra-fast speeds... up to 7x faster than the geostationary satellite-based Wi-Fi systems that most airlines use today.\" Other airlines may jump on board soon, too. British Airways is also on the verge of announcing a Starlink deal, Bloomberg reported, and SpaceX has also reportedly been in conversation with Dubai's Emirates. Both of those are flagship carriers in their respective nations, so winning the business would be a large coup for Starlink against legacy operators like Viasat and Echostar. Switching to Starlink isn't necessarily cheap, though. It reportedly costs around $300,000 to equip a 737 and around half a million to install the system on a 787 Dreamliner. On top of that, airlines pay around $120 monthly per seat, plus another $120 for live TV, according to Bloomberg 's sources. (None of the airlines in negotiations have confirmed any details.) Despite those costs, carriers see reliable in-flight internet as a potential game-changer, as it would allow customers to work, communicate and stream videos or live TV. If the latter can be done reliably, it might even allow airlines to get rid of heavy and expensive on-demand entertainment systems. The main downside for potential customers is SpaceX's owner, Elon Musk. Some may view his fractured relationship with US president Donald Trump as a negative, while end-users may be turned off by his political affiliations — something that has seemingly affected sales of his Tesla EVs of late.

The series Business Rebels features different CEOs walking viewers through the strategies that helped them disrupt their industries. One entitled Skin Health features top dermatologists and a cosmetic chemist walking viewers through keeping their skin healthy through cleansing routines and specific beauty products. The wide range of skills or life lessons you could learn through these classes is why MasterClass is on our list of best subscriptions you can give as gifts . Maybe your loved one who loves to host dinner parties could use some tips from Gordon Ramsay. There are three subscription tiers for MasterClass that each differ only in how many devices they allow at one time, and whether offline videos are supported. The Standard subscription only supports one device, whereas the Plus subscription allows two. These are normally $10 and $15 per month, respectively, and neither offers offline mode. The Premium tier, which carries a regular price of $20 per month, allows up to six devices and features offline mode for downloaded classes. All three tiers are part of the 50 percent off sale, which marks them down to $5, $8 and $10 respectively.

    "summary": "Important All chain operators are strongly encouraged to upgrade their batchers to improve throttling behavior and mitigate worst-case spam attack scenarios. Overview This release includes a major reworking of the batcher-sequencer DA throttling feature (allowing for smoother control of transaction and block size limits), a new admin RPC method to flush the batcher (causing it to submit a transaction as soon as possible) as well as several performance enhancements and bugfixes. Sequencer throttling changes Warning This release changes the default throttling behavior. Chain operators should examine the new throttling documentation closely to ensure their batchers are configured appropriately for their chain. We deem the new defaults well suited for average OP Stack chains that use the default block gas limits and EIP1559 elasticity. Especially if you operate a high-throughput chain, you may want to change the throttling parameters, like the block-size-upper-limit and block-size-lower-limit . The old batcher supported only a very simple form of throttling: once a threshold of DA backlog was reached, it would fully throttle the sequencer and other block builders. This would often lead to a clunky user experience, as throttling kicks in fully at once, and then eases fully once the backlog dips below the threshold. This release introduces three new throttling controllers to allow for more smooth throttling behavior than this step controller . The three new controllers are linear , quadratic , and a PID-like controller (experimental, not recommended). The new default throttling controller is quadratic . Instead of throttling getting activated at a single threshold, like the old step controller, there is now a lower and upper threshold at which throttling starts and then continually increases in intensity as the backlog grows. The intensity curve is determined by the throttling controller (linear, quadratic, step (old behavior), PID (experimental)). Throttling at the lower threshold is weak and at the higher threshold strong. Please review the defaults by running ./op-batcher --help . Another important change is that the throttling threshold now takes all pending data into account, that is, all channels that are currently being submitted, the pending open channel that is currently being built, and the pending blocks that still need to be added to the pending channel.

Instead of continuing to sell the older model, Apple discontinued the M3 Air and gave its newest computer a $100 price cut. Now, if you can even find a brand new M3 MacBook Air (typically from retailers like Amazon or B&H), it’s often more expensive than the M4 version. During sales like Amazon Prime Day, we’ve seen the newest M4 Air go for as little as $799. That effectively makes our overall pick a budget pick as well. Of course, $800 isn’t exactly a small investment either for college students or others on a budget. Especially when you can find some decent PCs for under $500 . If you’re looking to save even more on a MacBook, we recommend checking out refurbished options directly from Apple , or even third party sellers like BackMarket. There are a few guidelines to keep in mind, which we go over in our refurbished guide , but mainly, you’ll want to shop from a reputable source that has a stated process and offers at least a year-long warranty. Using your old gear as a trade-in will bring down your final cost as well. Factors to consider when buying a MacBook Compared to PCs, Apple computers tend to have more streamlined specifications. The company has long been known for this simplicity, and the M-series “system-on-a-chip” condenses things even further. Prior to the M1 chip, Apple used Intel chips in its laptop and desktop computers. The M2 and M3 generations followed that first chip and currently sells MacBooks equipped with M4-series chips. You’ll find the standard M4 processor in the Air and the base-model Pro and the upgraded M4 Max and M4 Pro chips as options for the MacBook Pro (currently there is no M4 Ultra chip, as there was with the M3 series in the Mac Studio). All M-series chips combine, among other technologies, the CPU, graphics card and unified memory (RAM). Apple’s Neural Engine is included too, which is a specialized group of processor cores that handles machine learning tasks such as image analysis and voice recognition. While a unified chip means you have fewer decisions to make when picking a MacBook, there are still a few factors to consider, including specs like the number of CPU cores, amount of RAM, storage capacity, screen size, and, obviously, price. The finish color may be a minor consideration, but it's worth pointing out that the Pro comes in just two colors (Silver or Space Black) but the Air comes in four hues (Midnight, Starlight, Sky Blue and Silver). CPU cores The lowest-specced chip in a current-lineup MacBook is the standard M4 chip, which is found in all models of the MacBook Air and the base model MacBook Pro 14-inch. That chip houses a 10-core CPU and either an 8- or 10-core GPU. In total, there are three versions of the M4 chip: standard M4, M4 Pro and M4 Max (which are each a step up from their predecessors, the M3, M3 Pro and M3 Max chips). The burliest chip, the M4 Max is built with either a 14- or 16-core CPU and a 32- or 40-core GPU. Cores are, in essence, smaller processing units that can handle different tasks simultaneously. Having more of them translates to the computer being able to run multiple programs and applications at once, while also smoothly processing demanding tasks like video and photo editing and high-level gaming. In short, more cores allow for more advanced computing and better performance. But if your processing power needs fall below professional-level gaming and cinematic video and audio editing, getting the highest number of cores is likely overkill — and after all, more cores equals higher cost and more power usage. Photo by Devindra Hardawar/Engadget RAM Your options for RAM, or in Apple’s terminology, unified memory, varies, but with the switch to the M4 chip in all laptops, the lowest amount of RAM you can get is now 16GB. That’s a necessary spec-bump to accommodate the tech world’s favorite feature of the moment: AI or, in this case, Apple Intelligence (still AI, but Cupertino’s version). The M4 Pro chip has 24 or 48GB memory options, while the M4 Max chip supports 48, 64 or a whopping 128GB of RAM. You’ve likely heard the analogy comparing memory to the amount of workspace available on a literal desktop surface, whereas storage is the amount of drawers you have to store projects to work on later. The larger the worktop surface, the more projects you can work on at once. The bigger the drawers, the more you can save for later. In addition to supporting Apple Intelligence, more RAM is ideal for people who plan to work in multiple apps at once. And the more demanding each program is, the more RAM will be required. Extra memory can also come in handy if you’re the type who likes to have infinite numbers of tabs open on your browser. If your daily workflow doesn’t involve simultaneously using a vast number of memory-intensive programs, you can save yourself money and buy the RAM configuration that you’re most likely to actually use. For a long time, Apple continued to offer MacBooks with just 8GB of RAM, and we recommended upgrading to at least 16GB of RAM. With this being the standard today, grabbing a base model should be fine for most non-pro-level users. One thing to note is that, unlike most PCs, the RAM in a MacBook is not user-upgradable since it’s tied into the system-on-a-chip. If you think you might end up needing more memory, you should go for the spec upgrade up front. Storage capacity (SSD) Storage options range from 256GB of SSD for the base-model MacBook Air and 8TB of storage for the MacBook Pros with the M4 Max chip. If you want to rotate between a long roster of game titles or keep lots of high-res videos on hand, you’ll want more storage. If you’re mostly working with browser- and cloud-based applications, you can get away with a smaller-capacity configuration. That said, we recommend springing for 512GB of storage or more, if it’s within your budget. You’ll quickly feel the limits of a 256GB machine as it ages since the operating system alone takes up a good portion of that space. Having 1TB will feel even roomier and allow for more data storage over the life of your laptop. When Apple announced the iPhone 15 , the company also announced new iCloud+ storage storage plans , with subscriptions that allow up to 12TB of storage shared among your iOS and MacOS devices. You could also transfer files to an external storage device. But if you don’t want to pay for a monthly subscription and prefer the convenience of having immediate access to your files, it’s best to get the highest amount of storage space your budget allows for at the outset. Screen size The MacBook Air comes in 13- or 15-inch sizes. Pro models have either 14- or 16-inch screens. A two-inch delta may not seem like much but, as Engadget’s Nathan Ingraham noted when he reviewed the then-new 15-inch M2-powered MacBook Air, a larger screen \"makes a surprising difference.” That’s especially true if you plan to use your laptop as an all-day productivity machine and won’t be using an external monitor. More space means you can more clearly view side-by-side windows and have a more immersive experience when watching shows or gaming. But screen size is one of the main factors influencing weight. The 13-inch MacBook Air M4 weighs 2.7 pounds, whereas the top-end 16-inch MacBook Pro with the Max chip weighs 4.7 pounds. If you plan to travel a lot or swap your work locations regularly, a smaller screen will make life easier in the long run. All MacBooks feature IPS LCD panels ( in-plane switching , liquid crystal display), which Apple markets as Retina displays. The MacBook Air M4 has a Liquid Retina display and the Pro models have Liquid Retina XDR displays. “Liquid” refers to the way the lighted portion of the display “flows” within the contours of the screen, filling the rounded corners and curving around the camera notch. “XDR” is what Apple calls HDR (high dynamic range). You also get the option of a standard or nano-texture display on the MacBook Pro. The glass, which reduces glare and is also available on the Studio Display, iMac and iPad Pro, comes with a $150 price increase, but if you really don’t like reflections on your screen, it could be worth it. Compared to most other laptops, MacBook displays are notably bright, sharp and lush. But one feature worth pointing out is another Apple marketing term: ProMotion. It’s the company’s term to describe a screen with a higher, 120Hz refresh rate, which results in smoother scrolling and more fluid-looking graphics. Only MacBook Pros offer ProMotion; the Air maxes out at 60Hz, which is perfectly fine for everyday browsing and typical workdays. But if you want buttery-smooth motion from your display, you’ll have to shell out more money for an upgrade. Operating systems Software considerations won’t make much of a difference when deciding between MacBook models — all come with macOS installed. But if you’re switching from, say, a Windows PC, the operating system may be something to factor into your decision — though it’s probably less of an issue than it once was. Now that so much of the work we do on our computers is browser- and cloud-based, the learning curve between the two platforms isn’t as steep. Apps and programs like Gmail perform similarly regardless of what computer you’re using. Apple machines have historically had more limited support of AAA gaming titles, but even that is changing with more AAA games and better graphics coming to Macs. As for macOS, it’s getting better too. With macOS Tahoe 26 , the Spotlight function is more advanced, making it easier to find apps and perform tasks straight from your keyboard. The software also implements Apple's unifying Liquid Glass design for a modern look that looks consistent across iOS and iPad devices. New enhanced iPhone continuity features also make MacBooks and the handset work better together. A revamped Shortcuts app is more powerful as well, giving users custom automations that leverage Apple Intelligence (the company’s own AI). Price When Apple announced the MacBook Air M4, it also delivered a bit of refreshing news: The latest model now starts $100 cheaper than the previous generation. So now, the least expensive MacBook is the 13-inch, M4-powered Air with 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage for $999. Alternatively, you can spend up to $7,349 for the 16-inch MacBook Pro M4 Max with the nano-texture glass, 128GB of RAM and 8TB of storage. Chip type, screen size, memory and storage capacity all influence the final price, which is why guides like this can help you determine just what you need (and what you don’t) so you can get the most cost-effective machine for you. AppleCare is another cost to consider. The extended warranty plan from Apple covers repairs from accidents and offers free battery replacement and starts at $3.50 per month or $35 per year for MacBooks. We recommend the MacBook Air M4 for most people, and thanks to that $100 price cut, it’s also a good budget option. If you want something even cheaper, we recommend looking at refurbished M-series models from Apple. We think the 14- or 16-inch MacBook Pros are best for professionals. If you have extra money to spare once you’ve picked your machine, we recommend upgrading to at least 512GB of storage to make your machine as future-proof as possible. Of course, if you're just after the M4 chip and want the cheapest route to get it, you might consider the M4 Mac mini , which starts at $599 (though you'll have to supply the screen, mouse and keyboard).

Both the MacBook Air and Pro models come with the M4 chip. MBP models have the option of more powerful M4 Pro or M4 Max chips. The Pro has a higher resolution screen with a higher peak brightness that supports up to 120Hz adaptive refresh rates and XDR (extreme dynamic range). The battery life on most Pro models is longer than on the Air models as well. Pro models also have more ports and more speakers. In short, the MacBook Air is aimed at everyday users looking for good productivity and entertainment capabilities, while Pro models are aimed at professionals who need a high-performance computer. What's the difference between macOS and Windows? MacOS is the operating system developed by Apple and used in all of its desktop and laptop computers. It can only be found in hardware made by Apple including MacBooks and iMacs. Microsoft’s Windows operating system can be found in the company’s own Surface laptops as well as computers made by a wide array of manufacturers, like Acer, Asus, Dell and Razer.

    "summary": "Troops already holding outskirts of territory’s capital, military says, while Israel approves huge new illegal settlement splitting West Bank Israel expands Gaza City offensive A group of 17 US Senators sent a letter to Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Wednesday calling for the United States to press Israel to grant access and protection to journalists in Gaza. The letter comes one week after an Israeli strike killed a group of Palestinian journalists in the besieged territory. Israeli defence minister Israel Katz’s order to send more troops into Gaza City came despite international criticism of the offensive , with fears of significant casualties and more mass displacement amid widening conditions of starvation in the territory. The situation in Gaza City was “catastrophic” and “large numbers” were fleeing eastern neighbourhoods , according to the Gaza municipality’s emergency committee chief, Mustafa Qazzaat. Resident Anis Daloul, 64, told the AFP news agency the Israeli military had “destroyed most of the buildings in Zeitoun and displaced thousands of people”. The additional Israeli reserve soldiers would not report for duty until September, a military official said on Wednesday, giving mediators time to bridge gaps between Hamas and Israel over the terms of any ceasefire and hostage deal. Hamas said Israel’s plans to conquer Gaza City showed its “blatant disregard” for efforts to broker a truce . The Israeli talk of a large-scale operation could primarily be intended to put pressure on the militant group in ceasefire talks, reports Peter Beaumont . More than 62,000 Palestinians have been killed in the Israeli war in Gaza since Hamas’s deadly attacks in October 2023, according to Gaza health officials. British UK foreign secretary David Lammy condemned Israel’s approval of the new settlement block in the West Bank as a “flagrant breach of international law”. The plan would split the West Bank into two with the intention – Israeli far-right minister Bezalel Smotrich has said – of ending any prospect of a Palestinian state. The Israeli military said on Thursday it has received a report about a security incident near the settlement of Malachei HaShalom in the West Bank , adding that details were under review.

    "summary": "With August already two-thirds out the door, it means we're getting closer to the Apple iPhone event , which typically takes place in September. During that event, we'll finally get to put our eyes on the iPhone 17 lineup. The latest iOS 26 features will come preinstalled on the new models, as well as any additional features Apple reveals at the launch event. But since we still have to wait a few weeks (presumably) until the iPhone event, we can at least speculate what the new phones will look like. As with most unreleased iPhone models, rumors and leaks have trickled in about the hardware side ahead of the official introduction. Here's what we're expecting and what we can reasonably assume we'll get from Cupertino in September. What are the latest iPhone 17 rumors? Could new \"TechWoven\" cases be introduced with the latest iPhone 17 lineup? That's what leaker Majin Bu claims , per a MacRumors report . The cases match the rumored design on the iPhone 17 models, with the wide camera bump. MacRumors says this could be a revamped version of the much-maligned FineWoven case, which was discontinued due to being susceptible to scratches and stains. Here are the new TechWoven Cases for iPhone 17 Full Article: https://t.co/UGMdYQWPJX pic.twitter.com/BftqiD03jO — Majin Bu (@MajinBuOfficial) August 20, 2025 The leaker noted there are two lanyard holes for \"convenient and secure carrying,\" so it could be worn around your neck. This is just a rumor and we won't know what the actual iPhone 17 models or accessories will look like until Apple's iPhone event next month. That said, the shared photos (including the one embedded above) are more convincing than usual. How much will the iPhone 17 cost? Apple's announced plan to expand US-based manufacturing partners seems to give it at least some shielding from the steepest Trump administration tariffs that have already triggered price increases on everything from Switch consoles to high-end cameras to Sonos speakers . But given that President Trump's trade policies can change from week to week, and Apple's continuing reliance on Asia-based supply chains, price shocks remain an ongoing possibility. The bigger question is: Will Apple absorb any higher costs, or pass them on to consumers? If prices do creep up, Apple may choose to pair it with an \"upgrade.\" Consider this recent rumor posted by MacRumors from a leaker known as \" Instant Digital ,\" suggesting that the default storage of the iPhone 17 line may start at 256GB, doubling the current 128GB baseline. While that could be accompanied by a price increase of $50 , Apple could at least pitch it as a \"better value.\" That said, the company doubled the default RAM of its Mac computers from 8GB to 16GB at no extra cost in 2024 — but that was before the current Trump tariff cycle started. When will the iPhone 17 series be announced? Most years, the flagship smartphones are introduced in September. MacRumors highlighted a story originally reported by iphone-ticker.de that the Apple iPhone 17 event could be Tuesday, September 9, according to information gleaned from German mobile phone providers. It's still too early to have the specific dates; some years, Apple only gives a week or two of lead time between sending invites and hosting the event. But years of past precedent show that sometime in September should be when the 17 models make their debut. This family of smartphones may be the last to follow that trend, however. There have been hints that the introduction of the iPhone 18 collection in 2026 will be split into a pro-tier announcement in the fall and a standard model announcement the following spring. What will the new iPhone 17 lineup include? Design leaks suggest that Apple is building an ultra-thin smartphone , likely to be named the iPhone 17 Air to match Apple's ultralight laptop designation. Bloomberg 's Mark Gurman, often a solid source of advanced intel about Apple, reported in January that the iPhone 17 Air will be equipped with a basic A19 chip and will only have a single camera lens. It may also use Apple's new in-house modem, which was introduced in February on the iPhone 16e . More details about this development may leak ahead of September, but that's what we know for now. An investor note from Apple analyst Jeff Pu indicated that the Air will have a titanium frame. If his reports are accurate, the lightweight smartphone will be the only entry in the iPhone 17 lineup to use that metal; the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max are expected to be made of aluminum, which is oddly a lighter material than titanium. Other speculation had suggested that the Air would use a blend of aluminum and titanium, so the exact materials may not be known until the official announcement. Additionally, an August 4 MacRumors report says the internal battery pack of the iPhone Air is just 2.49mm thick — half the thickness of the iPhone 17 Pro battery. The leak was posted on the Korean-language Naver blog , where they show the alleged batteries of the iPhone 17 Air and 17 Pro side by side. The same account claimed the 17 Air's battery capacity was a mere 2,800 mAh, MacRumors notes. (That's below the battery capacity of current iPhone 16 models.) On a similar topic, an iPhone 17 Pro production leak appears to have revealed an all-aluminum chassis, according to MacRumors . Originally posted by leaker Majin Bu , the image shows a shell that has a large round hole on the back (where the Apple logo typically is) to allow for MagSafe charging. MacRumors says this could just be a molding but notes that the aluminum frame (versus the current titanium in Pro iPhone models) would yield a significantly lower weight. That same leaker (Majin Bu), whom MacRumors classifies as a \"hit-or-miss leaker,\" suggests the iPhone 17 Pro will have better wireless signal strength thanks to an updated antenna design. The individual posted a render on X that shows a new antenna system that wraps around the iPhone 17 Pro's supposedly wider rear camera bump. Again, this is a render, not a real-world photo. That said, we can't knock the goal of better wireless reception, so we're hoping this one has a degree of truth to it. Each new roster includes a base model, but over the years, Apple has shaken up the variety of phones it offers. Most likely there will be an iPhone 17 and an iPhone 17 Pro. Apple has also committed to the size matters philosophy, and has been building an iPhone Pro Max option with an even bigger screen and better battery life; the 17 roster will almost certainly have one as well. The new Pro iPhones are said to have a full-width \"camera island\" on the rear, which would mark the first time an Apple model opted for that design. This feature can be seen in the purported iPhone 17 \"spotted in the wild.\" The pics, highlighted on MacRumors , show a black cased iPhone (17 Pro?) with the distinct back panel. Is it the real deal? The dual angles lend a degree of credibility in a social media landscape increasingly polluted with AI-enhanced fakes, but your guess is as good as ours. I just spotted a test development iPhone in the wild 🤩🤩🤩 pic.twitter.com/iS3PtKWqxJ — Fox Pupy 🦊🧡 (@Skyfops) July 28, 2025 The iPhone 17 Air seems primed to take the place of a potential iPhone 17 Plus. Since the iPhone 16e was only just introduced in February at a surprisingly high price point , it seems unlikely that there will be a new addition to that lower end of the spectrum, the models that were previously called SE. At the very least, it sounds like the iPhone 17 Air won't take away the charging port and rely only on wireless connectivity. Bloomberg said that while Apple had investigated making the iPhone 17 Air without a single port, the company (fortunately) changed plans. He also says that the rumored phone will have a 6.6-inch screen and include the Dynamic Island and Camera Control button. Finally, the price is rumored at $900 — likely more than the standard iPhone 17 but less than the Pro. We've also gotten what seems to be a reliable look at what the color lineup will be for the new smartphones. Macworld reported that the iPhone 17 will be available in black, white, steel gray, green, purple and light blue. The iPhone 17 Air will reportedly have four color options: black, white, light blue and light gold. While the Air colors will be less saturated, the visuals for the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max will go bold. The options for the Pro models are expected to be black, white, gray, dark blue and orange. On July 30, Tom's Guide highlighted an X post from Sonny Dickson — a longtime and generally reliable leaker of unreleased iPhone information — showing \"dummy\" iPhone 17 models in the new colors that were the source of the aforementioned Macworld story. While these are literally just mock-ups — not real, leaked iPhones — it's interesting to see how the design and color rumors translate into a real-world look and feel. To add the the rumors, a Weibo leaker known as Digital Chat Station suggests the iPhone 17e will come equipped with a new design that includes the Dynamic Island, MacRumors reports . According to the post, the new phone will have the A19 chip and could have a 6.1-inch OLED display with a front-facing 12-megapixel camera and a rear-facing 48-megapixel camera. However, it's important to note this report refers to the 17e model that would be expected to launch no earlier than February 2026, if it followed the same release pattern as the iPhone 16e . What will iOS 26 be like? Apple upended its numbering conventions with WWDC 2025, and will match the name of each new operating system to the year it's released. So when the next wave of iPhones hits, they'll be running on iOS 26 . On the design side, the smartphone OS introduced during the big developer showcase took a contentious approach dubbed Liquid Glass. Apple has been scaling down the amount of transparency effects in the subsequent beta tests of iOS 26, but it will still have a glass-like visual. The feature list includes big and small updates. On the more impactful side, the Phone and Photos apps have been redesigned. There will be several features leveraging artificial intelligence, such as live translation capabilities coming to Phone, FaceTime and Messages. Apple is also currently testing a sensitive content warning for child accounts that will freeze FaceTime video if nudity is detected by on-device machine learning tools. And the company is also launching Visual Intelligence, which will use AI to search for elements in an image. iOS 26 also has a litany of minor, quality of life improvements. Group texts are getting support for polls. And for the slow risers out there, iOS 26 will finally let you escape the tyranny of the nine minute snooze alarm . The next iOS is now available as a public beta . Here are our initial impressions of the Liquid Glass design and other new features. iOS 26 is compatible with all models back through iPhone 11. What other products are expected to be released alongside the iPhone 17? If Apple follows its usual pattern, the iPhone 17 will be announced alongside new Apple Watch products. That would be the Apple Watch Series 11 (if Apple sticks to the same naming scheme), and maybe an Apple Watch Ultra 3 and/or an updated Apple Watch SE. (They'll all run watchOS 26 , of course.) Other possibilities — and this is, again, speculation — could include refreshed Apple AirPods Pro (which received its last big update in 2022 ) and maybe new AirTags trackers (first released in 2021). The Apple rumor mill got a big shot in the arm this week thanks to the reported inclusion of product ID numbers in recent beta software builds. Per MacRumors , it's a laundry list of new hardware, including long-rumored product updates like the Apple TV , HomePod mini , new Apple Studio Display monitor and two fresh iPads. Of course, even if that list is totally accurate, we may not see those products until 2026 — if ever. So don't expect all of products to share the stage with the iPhone 17, especially since Apple likes to keep its star performer at the center of attention. That said, keep in mind that Apple has recently been having Mac-centric announcements in late October (as it did last year to debut new M4 Macs ), so there's always the chance of another shoe dropping a few weeks down the road.

    "summary": "Liquid Glass is a huge new change coming to iOS 26. (Apple) In just few weeks, Apple's annual iPhone event will likely be upon us, which means we'll finally get a look at the newest iPhone 17 lineup . In addition, the company will also give us an official date for downloading iOS 26 . Until that happens, you can download and install the newly released public beta 4 (or iOS 26 developer beta 7 for developers). I've been playing around with it for the past couple of weeks, and have found that taking screenshots is way better in the new operating system — Google and ChatGPT search options are now in the screenshots editor, for instance. You can see a more complete view of the new features in our preview of the iOS 26 public beta release , which shows off the fresh home and lock screen redesign. Called Liquid Glass , the new translucent look will extend across all of Apple's upcoming operating systems. The overhaul is one of several big changes coming to iOS, macOS , iPadOS and the rest of Apple's software suite, all of which were showcased during the company's WWDC keynote on June 9. After overpromising on AI plans last year, Apple kept its iOS roadmap focused more on basic quality of life improvements this year. There are multiple useful additions coming to the Phone and Messages apps on your iPhone, for instance: Apple execs outlined the ability to weed out spam texts or other unknown senders and an option to hold your spot on a phone call when you've been waiting for a representative to pick up. Plus, a treasured feature that we took for granted is coming back (hint: it's in the Photos app). Siri, meanwhile, is in a holding pattern. Apple has previously specified that its smarter voice assistant — first promised at WWDC 2024 — is delayed until some point \" in the coming year ,\" so you shouldn't expect any major changes in the current betas. But there are reports that Apple is aiming to give Siri a bigger brain transplant by basing it on third-party artificial intelligence models like OpenAI's ChatGPT or Anthropic's Claude, which could make 2026 a pivotal year. The company is also reportedly working on a 'stripped-down' AI chatbot to rival ChatGPT. With each beta, it seems like additional new improvements are popping up, like this new AirPods gesture we're all curious about, and this FaceTime feature that'll freeze your video if it detects nudity . With the release of the iOS 26 developer beta 5 , we saw more added features, like a new bouncy animation on the passcode screen and in the Control Center, MacRumors reports . Some or all of those changes will likely soon migrate into the separate public beta (see below). Most newer iPhone models are eligible to download iOS 26 (both the betas and final version). Want to see the full list of new features coming this fall? Read on. What is iOS 26? The current iPhone operating system is iOS 18, and Apple is still actively updating it — version 18.6.1 was released to restore Apple Watch blood oxygen monitoring functionality for certain users in the US. More recently, Apple released 18.6.2 to address a vulnerability related to image processing. But don't expect to see iOS 19 soon — or ever. Instead, Apple is skipping the numbering ahead to iOS 26 later this year. The company has decided to line up its iOS version numbers with a year-based system, similar to car model years. So while iOS and its sibling operating systems will be released in late 2025, they're all designated \"26\" to reflect the year ahead. It's official, we're moving to iOS 26. (Apple) What is Liquid Glass design? Let's be honest. Out of everything announced at WWDC this year, the new Liquid Glass design was the star of the show. The iPhone's home and lock screens have looked pretty much the same year after year — the last exciting thing (in my opinion) was the option to add your own aesthetic to your home screen by customizing your apps and widgets. So seeing the home and lock screens' new facelift is refreshing. So what exactly is Liquid Glass? Apple calls it a \" new translucent material \" since, well, the apps and widgets are clear. However, the screen can still adapt to dark and light modes, depending on surroundings. You'll also notice buttons with a new floating design in several apps, like Phone and Maps. They're designed to be less distracting than the current buttons, but are still easy to see. While the design overhaul has proven to be controversial since its announcement, some — including Engadget's own Devindra Hardawar — like the new direction, even if it's somewhat reminiscent of Microsoft's translucent Windows Vista Aero designs from nearly twenty years ago. That said, as of the release of the iOS 26 beta 2, Apple has already incorporated some user feedback into the design, dialing back the transparency in at least some places. And while it will continue to evolve, Apple users won't be able to escape it: Liquid Glass was designed to make all of Apple's OSes more cohesive. Here's a look at how the translucent aesthetic will look with the new macOS Tahoe 26 on your desktop. What are the new and notable features of iOS 26? iOS 26 has a laundry list of new features. Among the most worthwhile: Phone app redesign: You'll finally be able to scroll through contacts, recent calls and voicemail messages all on one screen. It also comes with a new feature called Hold Assist that'll notify you when an agent comes to the phone so you can avoid the elevator music and continue on with other tasks. Live Translation in Phone, FaceTime and Messages: iOS 26 is bringing the ability to have a conversation via phone call or text message with someone who speaks another language. Live Translation will translate your conversation in real time, which results in some stop-and-go interactions in the examples Apple shared during its presentation. Polls in group chats: Tired of sorting through what seems like hundreds of messages in your group chat? You and your friends will soon be able to create polls in group messages for deciding things like which brunch spot you're eating at or whose car you're taking on a road trip. Filtering unknown senders in Messages: If you haven't received spam texts about unpaid tolls or other citations, you're lucky. For those of us who have, those annoying messages will soon be filtered away in a separate folder. Visual Intelligence: Similar to a reverse Google image search, this new feature will allow you to search for anything that's on your iPhone screen. For instance, if you spot a pair of shoes someone is wearing in an Instagram photo, you can screenshot it and use Visual Intelligence to find those shoes (or similar ones) online. Photos tabs are back: For anyone who's still frustrated with the Photos changes made last year , you'll be happy to know that your tabs are coming back. Library and Collections will have their own separate spaces so you don't have to scroll to infinity to find what you're looking for. FaceTime \"Communication Safety\" feature: A newer addition to iOS 26 appears to be the FaceTime \"Communication Safety\" feature that pauses communications if and when nudity is detected. The feature appears to be a child safety feature that uses on-device detection, thus obviating any cloud-based privacy issues. New lock screen options : The iPhone lock screen gets more customizable in iOS 26, with a cooler clock, 3D wallpaper effects, more widgets and better focus mode options. Apple's Hold Assist will be nifty for those pesky services that put you on hold for 10 or more minutes. (Apple) New changes coming to iPadOS 26 Your iPad isn't getting left behind when it comes to big updates. Here's what's coming this fall. Multitasking and real windowing: When you download the newest update, you'll be able to have multiple apps running on your screen at the same time. Once you open an app, it'll appear on your screen as normal but you'll be able to resize and move it across your screen to make room for other apps. This feature is optional so you can turn it off if you don't like it. Visual update: Along with the other new OSes, iPadOS 26 is coming with the Liquid Glass aesthetic. This new look will appear on the lock and home screens, as well as the drop-down menus. New menu bar: When you swipe down on your screen, the new menu bar will appear with options like File, Edit, Windows and more. There's also a search option if you're looking for something specific. Check out our first impressions of iPadOS 26 . What about AirPods? AirPods are also getting updated with iOS 26. Here are some of the more notable functions. Enhanced audio recording: Apple calls this \"studio-quality\" audio recording, and with it, you'll notice more clarity while in noisy environments. Camera remote control: Using this, you can take a photo or start and stop video recording with just one press on your AirPods. When taking photos, you'll get a three-second countdown before your iPhone or iPad snaps the picture. Live translation feature: While not officially announced or confirmed, it appears that the long-rumored live translation for AirPods could be coming with iOS 26 . The evidence comes from a system asset spotted in the in iOS 26 beta showing a gesture that's triggered by pressing both earbud stems at the same time. The photo also shows words in several different languages. Which iPhones will be able to upgrade to iOS 26? A few iPhone models that run the current version of iOS — iPhone XR, XS and XS Max — won't be compatible with the latest upgrade. But any iPhones released in 2019 or later will be eligible for the iOS 26 update . iPhone SE (second generation or later) iPhone 11 iPhone 11 Pro iPhone 11 Pro Max iPhone 12 iPhone 12 mini iPhone 12 Pro iPhone 12 Pro Max iPhone 13 iPhone 13 mini iPhone 13 Pro iPhone 13 Pro Max iPhone 14 iPhone 14 Plus iPhone 14 Pro iPhone 14 Pro Max iPhone 15 iPhone 15 Plus iPhone 15 Pro iPhone 15 Pro Max iPhone 16 iPhone 16 Plus iPhone 16 Pro iPhone 16 Pro Max iPhone 16e Not listed here are the presumed new iPhone 17 models (or maybe iPhone 26?) that are all but certain to be announced and released in September. How to install iOS 26 beta The iOS 26 public beta is now available to download via the Apple Beta Software Program . If you're not already a member, you'll need to sign up to try out all the latest features. Just visit beta.apple.com and sign up with your phone number or email address. It's free. Once you're in, you can install it by going to Settings > General > Software Update and selecting iOS 26 public beta . A word of caution: Don't sign up with your main iPhone unless you're OK with any risks that occur with using an OS that isn't finalized. When will the final version of iOS 26 be released? iOS 26 will be released to the public this fall. It usually comes in September, within a week of the Apple iPhone event. Last year, it rolled out to iPhone users on September 16 — exactly one week after the iPhone 16 lineup was announced.

    "summary": "Welcome to Video Games Weekly on Engadget. Expect a new story every Monday or Tuesday (or Wednesday, whatever), broken into two parts. The first is a space for short essays and ramblings about video game trends and related topics from me, Jess Conditt, a reporter who's covered the industry for more than 13 years. The second contains the video game stories from the past week that you need to know about, including some headlines from outside of Engadget. Please enjoy — and I'll see you next week. On a planet shrouded in myth, in a land surrounded by lore, on a mountain draped in mystery, in a cave suffocated by secrets, the legend sleeps. For six years, the legend has slumbered while wild stories spiral around it, twisting and expanding and entwining. New words have been born and old words infused with evolved meanings: Believer. Doubter. Silkpost. The lies have grown so thick they’ve become corporeal, spreading trickery with a name and a dead smile. For six years, the legend has slept while the masses roiled, all of them waiting for the signal to awaken and know truth. All of them waiting for a bell that will ring, finally and clearly, on Thursday, August 21, 2025. Skong . Skong . Skong . It’s a special time in the Silksong subreddit . After years of silence around its sequel, Hollow Knight: Silksong , Team Cherry has scheduled a livestream with a “special announcement” about the game for August 21 at 10:30AM ET. Not only is this exciting for Metroidvania fans everywhere, but it’s also possible that this announcement marks the final moments of the Silksong subreddit as we know it. A strange cocktail of game delays, inconsistent updates and hyper-focused cult fandom has cultivated a fascinating little universe in r/Silksong, complete with its own rules, villains and heroes. It’s a place where clown wigs are commonplace and contributors have turned trolling into a role-playing artform. A LARPform, if you will. It’s a place that’s consistently made me laugh every time it’s appeared in my feed over the past year or so. Ahead of Thursday’s special announcement, this sub is experiencing the last gasps of desperate myth-making and hopeless anticipation before it transforms into something else entirely, armed with actual information about the sequel, gameplay videos and maybe even a firm release date. Or, dare I say it, a surprise launch. For just a moment longer in r/Silksong, anything is possible. And then it’ll be over. No matter what happens during Thursday’s livestream, the day will come when Silksong comes out and the drip-feed of silkposts dries up completely. But for now, our face paint is ready. Sometimes it’s just nice to recognize the madness and the beauty of the moment, before it slips away for good. The news News from ONL 2025 Gamescom 2025 kicked off on Tuesday with Opening Night Live, a showcase hosted by Geoff Keighley and the folks behind The Game Awards, and there were plenty of delightful morsels on display. Engadget UK Bureau Chief Mat Smith is on the ground at Gamescom in Cologne, Germany, to play upcoming titles and talk to developers, but for now, here are our headlines straight out of ONL 2025: Denshattack! is a blend of Tony Hawk, trains and shonen anime Battlestar Galactica might finally get the video game adaption it deserves Absolum is awesome and I can't wait to play it on October 9 Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 arrives on November 14 FromSoft's Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice is becoming an anime Fallout season two has a teaser trailer and a December 17 release date Black Myth: Zhong Kui is the next title from Game Science Studio Cult of the Lamb's next DLC is Woolhaven, out in early 2026 Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is coming to the Switch 2 And our headlines from Gamescom 2025 so far: Onimusha: Way of the Sword might be a more forgiving kind of samurai epic Resident Evil Requiem feels very familiar, but it's so well made that I respect the hell out of it Engadget's Gamescom Opening Night Live 2025 liveblog How to watch Gamescom 2025 and what to expect Gamescom 2025 runs through August 24. ROG Xbox Ally lands in October Microsoft is slowly establishing its handheld era with news that the ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X will be available on October 16. There’s still no official word on how much they’ll cost, but there are hints: As spotted by Wario64 , Best Buy recently listed the Xbox Ally at $550 and the Xbox Ally X at $900, and these fall in line with our predictions, which were based on the prices of existing ROG Ally handhelds. Alongside the release date, Microsoft announced the Handheld Compatibility Program , an initiative aimed at optimizing games for portable devices and informing players about how well they perform. It’s essentially Steam Deck Verified, but for Xbox handhelds, and it’s yet another sign that Microsoft’s portable gaming ambitions stretch beyond just one hardware manufacturer. The PS5 will cost more tomorrow than it does today First Nintendo and Microsoft raised the prices of their latest consoles, and now it’s Sony’s turn. Sony on Wednesday announced the following price increases for the PS5 family: Standard PS5 with a disc drive: $550, up from $500 PS5 digital edition: $500, up from $450 PS5 Pro: $750, up from $700 Sony blames the increases on a “challenging economic environment,” echoing sentiments from its contemporaries. The price hikes come at a time in the hardware generation when we’re used to seeing consoles get cheaper, which just makes this whole thing more frustrating. Rod Fergusson is in charge of BioShock again and already making big changes There have been signs of turmoil at BioShock 4 studio Cloud Chamber for a while now, including news earlier this month that the game failed a review with 2K executives and was due for a complete narrative revamp. Now, we’re seeing even more fallout. Former Gears of War and Diablo head Rod Fergusson has left Blizzard to lead development of BioShock 4 at Cloud Chamber, and his appointment comes alongside news that 80 people at the studio are being laid off. This is actually the second time Fergusson has joined the development of a BioShock game at the last second — he similarly swooped in and cut aspects of BioShock: Infinite at Irrational Games in 2012. The race through development hell between Judas and BioShock 4 continues. Blizzard’s cinematic and narrative team is unionizing Microsoft is the home of another video game union. Workers with Blizzard Entertainment’s Story and Franchise Development team, which handles in-game cinematics and lore for titles including Overwatch and World of Warcraft , voted this week to unionize under the Communications Workers of America. This covers about 169 developers and it marks the fourth unionization effort from Microsoft’s gaming teams, joining QA workers at Activision , ZeniMax and Raven Software . Steam censorship is breaking PayPal PayPal isn’t a valid way to buy games on Steam in certain countries any longer. Steam in July removed hundreds of games with adult and NSFW themes from its storefront, and updated its policies to ban \"content that may violate the rules and standards” of its payment processors. This was incredibly vague and raised immediate concerns around financial censorship, especially when combined with a related culling of thousands of games from Itch.io . Now, it’s confirmed that PayPal has terminated its partnership with Steam in multiple countries, affecting any denomination “ other than EUR, CAD, GBP, JPY, AUD and USD.” Valve says it’s being pressured by payment processors including Visa, MasterCard and PayPal to remove certain games and implement puritanical censorship policies, and this has already resulted in at least one game being unjustly removed from the platform. That game, VILE: Exhumed , is now available as shareware . Roblox is changing its rules after so, so many child-safety lawsuits Roblox is locking down its system for sharing and viewing user-generated games following a wave of lawsuits accusing developers of failing to protect their young userbase. All unrated experiences, or user-created games, will be restricted to the developer and anyone actively working on them, rather than being available to anyone over the age of 13, as is currently the case. This change and others, including a new system that automatically detects and tracks \"violative scenes\" on individual servers, will roll out over the coming months. Analogue delayed its N64 remake again It’s now due out in Q4 2025. :( Additional reading Kris Holt’s indie game roundup More action than RPG, Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 struggles to convince after a few hours' play by Robert Purchese at Eurogamer This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/video-games-weekly-silksong-and-gamescom-221635822.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "We've heard a lot this year about AI enabling new scams, from celebrity deepfakes on Facebook to hackers impersonating government officials . However, a new report suggests that AI also poses a fraud risk from the other direction — easily falling for scams that human users are much more likely to catch. The report, titled \"Scamlexity,\" comes from a cybersecurity startup called Guardio, which produces a browser extension designed to catch scams in real time. Its findings are concerned with so-called \"agentic AI\" browsers like Opera Neon , which browse the internet for you and come back with results. Agentic AI claims to be able to work on complex tasks, like building a website or planning a trip, while users kick back. There's a huge problem here from a security perspective: while humans are not always great at sorting fraud from reality, AI is even worse. A seemingly simple task like summarizing your emails or buying you something online comes with myriad opportunities to slip up. Lacking common sense, agentic AI may be prone to bumbling into obvious traps. The researchers at Guardio tested this hypothesis using Perplexity's Comet AI browser , currently the only widely available agentic browser. Using a different AI, they spun up a fake website pretending to be Walmart, then navigated to it and told Comet to buy them an Apple Watch. Ignoring several clues that the site wasn't legit, including an obviously wonky logo and URL, Comet completed the purchase, handing over financial details in the process. In another test, the study authors sent themselves an email pretending to be from Wells Fargo, containing a real phishing URL. Comet opened the link without raising any alarms and blithely dumped a bank username and password into the phishing site. A third test proved Comet susceptible to a prompt injection scam, in which a text box concealed in a phishing page ordered the AI to download a file. It's just one set of tests, but the implications are sobering. Not only are agentic AI browsers susceptible to new types of scam, they may also be uniquely vulnerable to the oldest scams in the book. AI is built to do whatever its prompter wants, so if a human user doesn't notice the signs of a scam the first time they look, the AI won't serve as a guardrail. This warning comes as every leader in the field bets big on agentic AI. Microsoft is adding Copilot to Edge , OpenAI debuted its Operator tool in January , and Google's Project Mariner has been in the works since last year. If developers don't start building better scam detection into their browsers, agentic AI risks becoming a massive blind spot at best — and a new attack vector at worst.

    "summary": "If you tried the demo for upcoming climbing game Cairn and somehow found it too easy, you're in for a treat. Developer The Game Bakers announced at the latest Future Games Show that Cairn will include a \"Free Solo\" mode that lets you tackle the game's already difficult climbs without pitons or a rope. A typical climb in Cairn — and most rock climbing games for that matter — tasks you with managing rope, and the pitons you use to anchor it to a rock face. You add pitons as you climb so that in the event you slip, you only fall to your last piton rather than all the way to the ground. In Free Solo mode, you don't have that safety net, turning each climb into more of a roguelike run. In the real life rock climbing world, \"Free Solo\" climbing is when you tackle a climb without a partner or traditional equipment. The term rose to mainstream relevance after the release of the documentary Free Solo , which followed climber Alex Honnold as he trained for and ultimately ascended El Capitan in Yosemite National Park. Adding a dangerous style of climbing to what's already a difficult game feels appropriate in this case. On top of a climbing mechanic that makes you move each limb individually, Cairn also requires you to manage your hunger, thirst and an inventory of supplies. At least based on its demo, the game is far more demanding then something like Jusant , which was much more concerned with making its traversal fun and expressive rather than realistically difficult. If you're itching for punishment, the Cairn demo is available to download now on PS5 and PC. The game will be released on both platforms on November 5, 2025.

    "summary": "Bloomberg has published a deep dive into operations at Oracle, chronicling the software giant's rise in cloud computing and current push into powering artificial intelligence projects. The publication reported that Oracle has promised to develop tens of billions of dollars in data centers, which have become a hot business. Notably, Oracle landed a deal to back operations at OpenAI, in a partnership that will give the AI company 4.5 gigawatts of computing power . According to Bloomberg , that's enough energy to power \"millions of American homes.\" So far, Oracle has seemed willing to throw money at its AI data center projects, no matter how expensive or irresponsible the needs might be. For instance, a source said the company plans to spend more than $1 billion a year powering a single data center in Texas with gas generators rather than waiting for a utility connection to be built. When completed, this data center is expected to be one of the largest known sites, with computing power of 1.4 gigawatts. In addition to the huge monetary cost, such a project can also have negative human and environmental impact. The Elon Musk-owned xAI is under fire after a supercomputer for its artificial intelligence operations became a primary source of air pollution in Memphis thanks to methane-powered turbines. Other majors, including Google , Microsoft and Meta , have chosen to try nuclear power for their data center projects, which comes with its own potential complications and risks. Purely on the financial side, Oracle's decision to invest so much so quickly meant the company reported its first negative annual cash flow since 1990. Should the current rates of AI investment turn out to be a bubble, it could be very bad news to have many billions of dollars on the line.

    "summary": "Analogue's 4K take on the Nintendo 64 is… still not quite here. The company announced its third delay to the Analogue 3D on Wednesday, pushing the retro system back to Q4 2025. However, it said that's an intentionally conservative estimate, so this probably isn't a huge concern. The postponement follows previous ones in March and July. (The last time was due to tariffs .) Analogue acknowledged the frustration pre-order customers must be feeling. \"We know this sucks,\" the Pocket maker wrote. \"Another delay, announced late, after months of patience. We feel it too.\" The Analogue 3D uses an FPGA (field programmable gate array) chip to emulate N64 hardware. The company promises it will work with every official N64 cartridge ever released without any slowdowns or inaccuracies. Analogue So, why bother with the $250 console when you can grab a used Nintendo 64 for under $100? Well, Analogue's take supports 4K output, variable refresh rate displays and both PAL and NTSC carts. It's also adding \"original display mode\" filters to simulate old-school TVs. (They're similar to those you find on the company's highly rated Analogue Pocket handheld console .) Analogue says the system is 99 percent done — including hardware, system and packaging. \"The last 1% is where we're focused,\" the company wrote. It says it wants every detail to meet its high standards. Nonetheless, pre-orderers who wish to bail can do so by contacting support. Frustrations aside, delays are indeed better than shipping incomplete products — even if only by one percent. \"We're pushing without pause and appreciate everyone's patience and trust,\" the company wrote in an email to customers. \"Analogue will always deliver — delays or not, it's a commitment to our standard of care.\" This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/analogue-delays-its-n64-remake-console-yet-again-205343467.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "The Qi2 wireless charging spec was originally announced back in early 2023 . However, Android phone makers haven’t exactly been rushing to add Qi2 support to their latest devices since then. That’s made finding a compatible handset rather difficult, which is a bummer for anyone who has seen the wealth of accessories and power banks that iPhone owners have had access to for several generations. On top of faster charging speeds (up to 25 watts or higher in later revisions), Qi2 dictates the inclusion of embedded magnets designed to make aligning and attaching peripherals a cinch. But what makes the slow rollout a bit more frustrating is that Apple is a member of the Wireless Power Consortium (the governing body in charge of Qi2) and its MagSafe tech was used to help define the spec and ensure that compliant add-ons work seamlessly with Qi2, so it’s not like there’s a lack of compatible peripherals. Regardless, to help you figure out which Android phones officially come with Qi2, we’ve compiled a list of supported devices. (Note: Due to the complexities of the Chinese market, this list is primarily focused on gadgets available in North America and the EU.) Android phones with Qi2: The HMD Skyline . The Google Pixel 10 family . That’s it, seriously. Though now this list does include one of the biggest Android phone makers in Google. That said, there is one wrinkle with the Pixel 10 line. While Google's Pixelsnap standard is Qi2 compatible, wireless charging speeds for the base Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro are staying the same at 15 watts. However, only the Pixel 10 Pro XL comes with support for the more powerful Qi2.2 spec which allows for wireless charging at up to 25 watts. So if you want the convenience of cable-free magnetic charging and want to do it as fast as possible, you're going to have to pay extra for the most premium version of the Pixel 10. The status of other Android phone manufacturers But what about the Galaxy S25? Unfortunately, despite Samsung saying that it will release multiple “Android devices supporting Qi2” this year, its latest batch of flagship phones (including S25 Edge, Galaxy Z Flip 7 and Galaxy Z Fold 7 ) are merely \"Qi2 ready.\" But what does that mean? Like previous models, the Galaxy S25 family can charge wirelessly at up to 15 watts. However, because the phones don't have magnets on their back, Qi2 accessories slide off when you try to attach them. This can be addressed by purchasing a compatible case with a built-in magnetic mounting system or a magnetic ring mount, but at least out of the box, the Galaxy S25 line requires additional assistance in order to work with the growing market of Qi2 peripherals. OnePlus also claims the OnePlus 13 supports Qi2. However, in our testing, the magnets inside the phone are so weak that it didn't latch on securely to any of the Qi2 accessories we tested. However, similar to the Galaxy S25, if you pair the OnePlus 13 with one of the company's magnetic cases, you can attach Qi2 peripherals as normal. Finally, when asked if it had plans to release Qi2-compatible phones, Motorola would only say that it is \"committed to bringing the latest technology across our devices.\" As new phones with Qi2 hit the market, we will try to keep this list as up-to-date as possible. Or at least until the spec becomes a much more mainstream standard. Update, August 20 2025, 4:45PM ET: This story has been updated with info about Qi2 support on the Pixel 10 family.

Apple's security notes say the update plugs a hole related to Image I/O.

    "summary": "Exclusive: White House flagged institutions including those for Latino, African and Asian art for review, document shows Amid the Donald Trump administration’s heavy-handed review of Smithsonian museums, the Guardian has seen a document compiled by the White House that argues the widely visited cultural institutions have overly negative portrayals of US history, from a Benjamin Franklin exhibit that links his scientific achievements to his ownership of enslaved people and a film about George Floyd ’s murder that it says mischaracterizes the police. The document, based on public submissions shared with the administration, shows that seven museums have so far been flagged for review: the National Museum of American History, National Museum of the American Latino, National Museum of Natural History, National Museum of African Art, National Portrait Gallery, Smithsonian American Art Museum and National Museum of Asian Art.

    "summary": "Microsoft is creating a new \"advanced shader delivery\" feature for the ASUS ROG Xbox Ally handhelds that might make loading games faster and more stutter-free. The company teased the upcoming feature alongside the announcement of the launch date for the first Xbox-branded handhelds and the company's new compatibility system for figuring out if games will run well on handhelds. Shader stutter is a widespread issue in PC gaming that doesn't occur on consoles because of their uniform hardware. You have to download shaders for a PC game to make sure that they run correctly on your specific hardware. Typically, a game downloads shaders when they're first launched, which can add to the wait before you can actually start playing, and lead to things like framerate drops as shaders are compiled in the background. Microsoft's system \"preloads game shaders during download\" which the company says will allow games to launch up to 10 times faster, \"run smoother, and use less battery on first play.\" It sounds like this new shader delivery system will require some amount of buy-in from developers, which means it likely won't impact every game at launch. It's just one of the ways Microsoft is trying to address the complexity and inefficiency Windows 11 can add to gaming. Besides including easier access to features like the Game Bar and ASUS' Armoury Crate software, the company also says that its handheld version of Windows will \"minimize background activity and defer non-essential tasks\" to devote more resources to playing games. Microsoft wants theses handhelds to be a success, so it makes sense to put in the work. But in a world where Xbox home consoles look even more like Windows PCs, the company might also be making improvements now that it can take advantage of later.

    "summary": "For nearly 30 years, developer Capcom has been redefining its particular brand of survival horror for the Resident Evil series. Despite its tone shifting between action-horror games and more pure horror entries, where players face down grotesque moments with scant resources, the series still manages to place players in tense encounters that define the series' against-all-odds approach to horror. And with the upcoming Resident Evil Requiem — or RE9 — appears to continue the series' current momentum in delivering compelling horror experiences. Just ahead of Gamescom 2025, I got to experience the opening of Resident Evil Requiem , focusing on new protagonist Grace Ashcroft (daughter of Alyssa Ashcroft from Resident Evil Outbreak ) and her desperate attempt at fleeing a horrifying clinic within a strange mansion. Capcom's return to traditional survival horror was one of the best games showcased at Summer Game Fest 2025 , and spending more time with it recently made me appreciate the series' renewed vision — even if it's a bit familiar. Much like recent core entries in the Resident Evil series — VII and Village — Resident Evil Requiem places a keen focus on immersion, truly capturing that sense of dread as you walk down the halls of an unnerving facility. The larger story of Requiem seems to be pointing towards a homecoming of sorts for the series' most pivotal event — the destruction of Raccoon City in Resident Evil 2 and 3 . While Requiem 's story will expand into a more ambitious scope, the demo I played focused on Grace's harrowing attempt to escape her abductors. In this sequence, Grace frees herself from an inverted hospital gurney and finds herself trapped in a ruined clinic filled with the bodies of dead doctors. In keeping with the brand of horror from the Resident Evil 2 remake and Resident Evil Village , I was being stalked by an imposing, grotesque monster hiding in the ceilings. Without weapons and with only empty bottles for distractions and sources of light to keep the beast at bay, the sequence felt very much like a stealth puzzle sequence, where I had to examine the movements of the beast and figure out a way to maneuver around it. I had previously seen this particular sequence during Summer Game Fest 2025. While I was impressed with its presentation — which features some of the most impressive lighting and character rendering I've seen from Capcom's RE Engine — I found the premise and scenario to be somewhat too familiar than I would have liked. Since Resident Evil VII , the series has leaned heavily into putting players in the series' most vulnerable moments, which often entail being stalked by imposing foes without any means to defend oneself. Capcom That sense of vulnerability can often feel played out, especially within the current horror game space, where running away from things is its sub-genre. However, getting to play Resident Evil Requiem properly made me appreciate Capcom's attempt to maintain the momentum from Resident Evil VII . And a lot of that had to do with the fact that Requiem now stars a more fully defined protagonist. Ethan Winters from VII and Village was a faceless protagonist with somewhat generic motivations, but he gradually became more well-rounded by the end of his story in Village . Now, with Grace, we're thrust into an unfamiliar situation, as she's more of an active participant in the story — talking to herself throughout the demo — and I felt a stronger connection to her sense of vulnerability as a protagonist. One of my favorite moments from the preview came shortly after I encountered the monster for the first time. After evading it, I went to the clinic's waystation to find a tool to open a fuse box. As I was wheeling a cart over to an elevated toolbox, the creature came into the room. As I tried hiding behind the cart, the monster spotted me and smashed the cart into me, which sent Grace hurling back to the wall. The beast then grabbed Grace and took a giant bite out of her shoulder. I used up my only health item and fled the room, returning to the well-lit safe that started the preview. Once the monster was gone, I snuck back into the waystation to retrieve the item — but more carefully this time around. It was a scary moment, but still totally exciting, and it had me on edge for the rest of the preview. Capcom Much like Resident Evil VII and Village , Requiem is by default a first-person game, which certainly creates a palpable sense of dread and uneasiness when exploring with a limited perspective. However, Requiem also adds the option to switch to third-person , which was introduced post-launch for Resident Evil Village and its DLC, Shadows of Rose. Having played the demo from both perspectives, I was impressed with how well the presentation feels tuned for both styles. The third-person perspective captures that sense of dread and adds in the expanded visibility, which gave me a clear and distressing view of the monster stalking me from behind as I ran towards the safe room. In the final stretch of my preview, I had all the tools I needed to make my exit. However, the storm outside the building blew out the lights in the area, allowing the monster to give chase. This sprint to the finish was tense and riveting. Even having seen the demo hands-off months prior, playing the sequence on my own made for a captivating experience. Once Grace made her exit, she had one last confrontation with the monster before the demo came to an abrupt end. Capcom So far, Resident Evil Requiem feels like a souped-up version of the immersive survival horror found in recent entries of the series — and it does very well based on this preview. I appreciated just how atmospheric this one, fairly limited, area of the preview was — seeing the long stretch of the hallway, with only my lighter and a dim red light illuminating in the distance, made for a striking visual — especially with the silhouette of the monster looming in the distance. That said, as well made as these sequences were, I'm already looking forward to seeing what sort of other tricks and events Requiem has in store. While I was a bit mixed on Village 's Resident Evil amusement park-style structure, I'm hoping Requiem will still take some big swings with its new twist on the series' survival horror. I have plenty of questions about Resident Evil Requiem , but I'm intrigued about what's to come for this series' next big move ahead. Resident Evil Requiem will be released on February 27, 2026 for PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S.

    "summary": "Ubisoft and Evil Empire's long-awaited The Rogue Prince of Persia is finally out and available for purchase . It's been in early access on Steam for over a year and the developers have made plenty of changes during that time to get the game ready for a general launch. It's available for PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store, Xbox Series X/S and PS5. It's also playable in the cloud by using the Xbox Cloud service, Ubisoft+ and Amazon Luna. Nintendo fans will have to wait a bit longer. The game's coming to the Switch and Switch 2, but not until later this year. For the uninitiated, The Rogue Prince of Persia is a sidescrolling roguelike with plenty of fast-paced action and a graceful move set inspired by other games in the franchise. Co-developer Evil Empire is the company behind the iconic Dead Cells , which is also a sidescrolling roguelike. Since launching in early access, developers have added more biomes and a new story, in addition to refining the gameplay and character designs. If you've been hankering for a new roguelike with some light Metroidvania elements (just like Dead Cells ), this could be the game you've been waiting for. It costs $30.

    "summary": "Gemini is launching in early access on smart displays and speakers in October, Google announced in a new blog post . Gemini for Home will replace Google Assistant on the company's smart home devices, and will apparently be available in both free and paid versions, implying Google is interested in expanding its subscription business, not unlike Amazon is with Alexa+ . Google originally demoed Gemini for Home back at CES 2025 . At the time, the company was primarily promising that generative AI would make conversations with smart devices more natural by removing the need for wooden voice commands. You can speak to Gemini like you would a human being and get the results you'd expect, whether its an answer to a trivia question or an adjustment to your thermostat. The real promise of Gemini integration is how the AI assistant's multimodal features could use inputs from other Nest devices — a video feed from a security camera, for example — to answer more complex questions about what's happening in your home. For Google's October early access rollout release, the company seems to be guaranteeing all of those same improvements, on top of offering access to Gemini Live for even more personalized conversations. What Google's blog post doesn't cover is how much all this costs and what Gemini features will be locked behind a subscription. Back at CES, the company said that Nest Aware subscribers — who pay $10 per month — would get early access to Gemini in Google Home later this year. The paid version of the AI assistant could just be rolled into Google's existing subscription, but the company might also offer it as a separate add-on. Gemini for Home launches in early access in October. Google says it will \"share more details soon\" about the rollout. Maybe that news will be paired with the release of a new Nest speakers and smart displays. The last Nest Hub was released in 2021, which suggests the lineup is more than due for a refresh.

    "summary": "Google just revealed a spate of new devices , including a line of Pixel 10 smartphones . Amazon has joined the hype train early, as it now offers gift cards when pre-ordering one of these handsets . The gift cards range in value from $100 to $300, depending on what device is purchased. Perhaps the most notable is a $200 gift card when pre-ordering the Pixel 10 Pro with 128GB of storage. This model costs $1,000, so that basically drops the price down to $800. The Pixel 10 Pro offers wireless charging , an improved camera system, a brighter display and a bigger battery than last year's model. It ships on August 28. Pre-ordering the bigger and beefier Pixel 10 Pro XL with 256GB of storage provides a $200 Amazon gift card. This one costs $1,200 and ships on August 28. The base Pixel 10 smartphone with 128GB of storage also hits stores on that date and comes with a $100 gift card . The price for the entry-level handset is $800. Finally, there's the Pixel 10 Pro Fold. The 512GB version of this foldable comes with a $300 gift card , which is enough to really do some damage on Amazon. There are some caveats. This one costs $1,900 and doesn't ship until October 9 . All of this gift card madness ends on September 4. In other words, scoop up a pre-order in the near future to get one.

    "summary": "Yes, September is all about iPhone, but Google is taking center stage today with its hotly anticipated Pixel hardware event. Thanks to a parade of leaks, we think we know mostly what to expect today — Pixel 10 phones, along with new watches and earbuds — but we'll know for sure later today. That's because the event kicks off at 1PM ET. If you want to be the first to hear the official scoop, you can tune into the Made by Google YouTube channel (or right here!) to catch Google's event, which will be hosted by Jimmy Fallon and also include other celebrities like Stephen Curry , Lando Norris and the Jonas Brothers — get ready for some potentially awkward cue card readings! And open a second window to follow our Pixel event liveblog for real-time analysis. What's on tap? You can expect a more power-efficient Tensor G5 processor in all the new Pixel 10 phones. (That could help power new Gemini AI features , too.) The base-level Pixel 10 should get a big camera upgrade: a 5x telephoto lens. Before this generation, you had to splurge on a Pro or Fold model to get optical zoom. Cameras will be higher-res across the board, too. In other areas, Qi2 magnetic charging is expected to come to the new Pixels. Expect a new accessory ecosystem, a la Apple's MagSafe , dubbed \"Pixelsnap.\" We'll also likely see the Pixel Watch 4 with a larger battery and smaller bezels . And the Pixel Buds 2a could bring refinements to the company's budget earbuds . Sam Rutherford for Engadget Engadget's Pixel 10 leak roundup will give you a much more detailed dive into the rumors. You can head back here on August 20 at 1PM ET to watch live.

    "summary": "The latest and greatest of the foldable phone world. (Google, Sam Rutherford/Engadget) Last month, the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 was released and immediately became the de facto king of the foldable phone hill. But today a new challenger has arrived: The Pixel 10 Pro Fold . Initial details are now available, and Google is having a splashy launch event to introduce it (and the full new Pixel 10 line ) to the world. These two smartphones are vying for the title of best foldable — both with very similar designs, but each bringing something unique to the table. Samsung launched its first foldable phone in 2019, so it's had quite a bit of time to refine the Galaxy Fold over the years. Google on the other hand just released its first Pixel Fold a couple years ago — but has already largely evened the match . And, of course, with enhanced Gemini AI software integration front and center, you'll have access to Google's impressive artificial intelligence features at nearly every turn. We'll break down how the Pixel 10 Pro Fold and Galaxy Z Fold 7 stack up to one another. You can also check out our comparison of the Pixel 9 Pro Fold and the Galaxy Fold 6 to see how much has changed in a year. For more, see everything else that was announced at the Made by Google Pixel event today, including the Pixel Watch 4 . Price First things first, how much will one of these high-tech folding phones cost you? That is the make-or-break question, after all. The newest Pixel foldable is still less expensive than this year's Z Fold: it starts at $1,799 while the Galaxy smartphone starts at $2,000. You don't have any other real choices for \"book-style\" foldables in the US market. The OnePlus Open can be had for $1,499, but it's almost two years old. And Apple's most expensive phone is currently the $1,599 1TB iPhone 16 Pro Max — but as a non-foldable model with just a single screen, it's hardly a straight comparison. If the rumor mill is to be believed, Apple may finally bow a foldable iPhone in 2026 . Dimensions and display It's a race for the largest display and Samsung won this time — but not by much. The Galaxy Z Fold is just a hair bigger than the Pixel Pro Fold. Both phones' inner displays are 8 inches across when fully opened, while Samsung comes out ahead on the outer display with 6.5 inches (the Pixel is 6.4 inches). As for height, the new foldable Pixel phone is 6.1 inches and the Galaxy Z is 6.2 inches — not a huge difference there. When unfolded, the Samsung wins on size efficiency, packing the identically sized 8-inch internal display into an area that's 0.3 inches smaller — 5.6 inches versus the Pixel's 5.9. This year, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold’s displays have been upgraded to a Super Actua Flex OLED display with ultra-thin glass. Both the front screen and back cover come equipped with Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2. As for the Galaxy Z Fold 7, it has a Dynamic AMOLED display (inner and outer) and comes with the Corning Gorilla Glass Ceramic 2 on the front and the Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the backside. The glass is ultra-thin, yet it's 50 percent thicker than before. While slightly bigger, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is still lighter than the Pixel 10 Pro Fold. The Samsung model weighs only 7.6 ounces — down nearly an ounce from its 2024 model — while its Google competition comes in at 9.1 ounces (the same as last year's model). The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 (left) compared to the new Pixel 10 Pro Fold (right). (Sam Rutherford/Engadget) Processor, RAM, storage and battery The Pixel 10 Fold Pro runs the Tensor G5 chip — Google says its CPU features 34 percent better performance compared to the Tensor G4 chip. The Z Fold 7 is powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy. \"Everything feels fast and snappy,\" Engadget's Sam Rutherford said of the Snapdragon 8 Elite performance on the Z Fold 7. (Sam also has first impressions of the Pixel 10 Pro Fold , but speed tests will happen a bit later.) Both phones offer the choice of 256GB, 512GB or 1TB storage. On the RAM front, the Pixel Fold delivers 16GB across the line, while the Samsung model reserves that level for the top 1TB storage tier; the small models get 12GB instead. The Galaxy phone will cost you $2,419 if you decide you need the maximum amount of storage, whereas the Pixel Fold tops out at $2,149. When it comes to battery life, Samsung's foldable lasts up to 24 hours with a 4,400mAh battery. The Pixel lasts up to 30 hours thanks to a more capacious 5,015mAh battery rating. Furthermore, the Pixel Fold is certified for Qi2 wireless charging, which Google is branding as \" Pixelsnap \" across its 2025 Pixel line for the first time.. Color options If you like having multiple colors to choose from, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is winning in this category. It comes in Mint, Jetblack, Blue Shadow and Silver Shadow. Mint is only available if you buy your phone online — you won't be seeing that one in stores. As for the Pixel 10 Fold Pro, your options are Moonstone and Jade.

Shannon “SJ” Joslin, a ranger and biologist who studies bats, said they hung a 66ft-wide transgender pride flag on the famous climbing wall that looms over the California park’s main thoroughfare for about two hours on 20 May before taking it down voluntarily. A termination letter they received last week accused Joslin of “failing to demonstrate acceptable conduct” in their capacity as a biologist and cited the May incident. Continue reading...",

    "summary": "Ever since Samsung introduced the Galaxy Ring , I’ve wanted Google to make a smart ring. I initially imagined it would be a Pixel Ring — something that would fit into the existing wearable portfolio that includes the Pixel Watch and Pixel Buds. But at a recent roundtable with the heads of Google’s Health, Fitbit and Wearables businesses, I was presented a more compelling possibility. When CNN ’s Lisa Eadicicco asked the question on everyone’s mind about whether Google would expand its wearable product portfolio with other types of gadgets, the answer surprised me. After first giving an expected “nothing to share as yet” response, Sandeep Waraich, the senior director of product management for Google Wearables, pointed towards the Fitbit family. “We see there’s a big opportunity with a discrete device that lasts very long [and] has a simple experience that’s very focused on health and fitness.” Waraich continued by saying “today, Fitbit has a pretty robust portfolio but it has not been refreshed for a while, so that’s where we see opportunity and we have been deeply thinking about bringing the right experiences.” He did not reveal much more upon further pushing, but one thing became clear to me. If Google were to make a smart ring, it would be part of the Fitbit family. That makes a lot of sense, if you consider the activity trackers that Fitbit is synonymous with. They are fairly basic wristworn devices that do little more than count your steps, track your heart rate and occasionally vibrate to tell you to look at your phone. You could say they’re unsophisticated, but they’re also simple and serve very specific purposes. Plus, they last forever — clocking between days and weeks on a charge. As someone who loathes wearing any device to bed, I’m frustrated at the lack of options available to me for sleep-tracking. Bed sensors don’t seem to get very accurate data, while bedside radar or motion detectors (like the Nest Hub or Amazon’s retired Halo RIse) have been largely abandoned by their makers. A smart ring, like the Galaxy Ring or Oura, are effective and comfortable solutions. The thing is, a lot of my digital data is housed in Google services. I’m a Gmail girl, and I pay quite a lot every month for a generous amount of Drive storage. A Google-powered sleep tracker appeals to my data hoarder tendencies. Throw in the fact that Fitbit has long led the way in accurate and sophisticated sleep and activity tracking, and a Fitbit Ring’s potential grows significantly. Of course, there’s always the risk that, should Google make a smart ring, it might give up on the product after a few years, rendering my data or device useless. Just look at the Google graveyard . I will say that Waraich and his colleagues seem to see a future where people have multiple devices that serve various, specific purposes. A smartwatch and smart ring could both coexist as useful accessories that feed into a person’s main device, which these days is usually a smartphone. In addition to those gadgets, people likely also own laptops, TVs and tablets — screens of all sizes. In response to a follow-up question on the topic of a multi-device lifestyle, Google’s general manager of Health and Home Rishi Chandra said “There’s no doubt we need to maximize the devices you already have.” But he added “there’s no doubt in my mind there’s going to be new form factors that will exist.” He cautioned, though, that “it’s too early to have conviction,” stating that currently the team is in the “experimentation phase.” “We are experimenting,” Chandra said. What comes out of that experimentation and what sticks around ultimately depends on developments in the industry that no one can assuredly predict. I do think, though, that given the company’s expertise in simple, straightforward activity trackers, a Fitbit Ring would not be too much of a stretch. Plus, the fact that the Oura Ring is now in its fourth generation and that it and the Galaxy Ring have proven to be worthwhile devices show that there is a market for this category.

    "summary": "Microsoft announced Wednesday during Gamescom 2025 that not only will its Xbox Ally handhelds be released on October 16, but the company is spinning up a new initiative to support optimized gaming on these devices called the Handheld Compatibility Program. The initiative seems to be similar to Valve's Steam Deck Verified , where Xbox will test games to ensure their compatibility with the new Xbox Ally handhelds. \"We have worked with game studios to test, optimize, and verify thousands of games for handheld compatibility, allowing you to jump into the game without having to tweak settings, or requiring only minor adjustments,\" said Roanne Sones, CVP of Gaming Devices and Ecosystem at Xbox. The program will be available on release day and users will be able to see handheld compatibility directly in their game libraries. Games will be badged as \"Handheld Optimized,\" indicating games with default controller inputs, appropriate resolution for full-screen play and more. Games badged as \"Mostly Compatible\" may require minor in-game setting adjustments for an optimal experience on the Xbox Ally handheld. Microsoft says it will continue to partner with developers to submit their titles for handheld compatibility testing. In addition to the \"Handheld Optimized\" badge, games will also be given a Windows Performance Fit indicator of either \"Should play great\" or \"Should play well.\" Microsoft says these signal \"compatibility and performance fit,\" but really it's anyone's best guess what that means or how it's different from the Handheld Performance badge. We've reached out to Microsoft for additional details and will update if we hear back.

    "summary": "Google unveiled its Pixel 10 lineup today, and the company’s latest phones will be the first to implement industry-standard C2PA Content Credentials within the native camera app. This enables people to identify whether an image was edited using AI, confirming its authenticity (or lack thereof) to anyone looking at it. The Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity, or C2PA , designed an open technical standard that essentially enforces transparency on a piece of media, providing information on how it was created and what, if any, modifications have been made. Appearing as a digital watermark (the C2PA likens it to a nutrition label), Content Credentials will be present in all photos taken by a Pixel 10 camera, and that imprint will also be viewable by anyone using Google Photos. The camera features on the latest Pixel phones are more pumped full of AI than ever, making it possible to apply edits in Google Photos using text or natural language voice prompts describing what you want. This in theory allows anyone lacking photo editing skills to bypass the manual process entirely, and by tapping on different parts of the photo you can get Gemini-powered suggestions on what edits to make. Google joined the C2PA last year , assisting with the development of the latest version of Content Credentials and eventually building the tech into Google Search, so that any image containing CP2A metadata would be identifiable as such. The standard is now supported in Google Images, Lens and Circle to Search, as well as the Pixel 10 phones announced today. Content Credentials will gradually roll out to Android and iOS devices running Google Photos in the coming weeks.

    "summary": "Google is kicking off the fall tech event season (albeit in late summer) today with its Made by Google showcase . The headline attraction at the event is the Pixel 10 lineup, but there's plenty of other interesting stuff on offer too, such as the Pixel Watch 4, Pixel Buds 2a and — of course — a bunch of AI-related announcements. Google has also confirmed something many folks have been waiting for: its take on MagSafe. The company is calling its version Pixelsnap. Here's a look at everything that announced at the Made by Google event, along with links to our more in-depth coverage of each product and our hands-on impressions: Pixel 10 A tenth birthday is typically cause for a special celebration. The Pixel brand isn't quite that old yet (the original Google Pixel arrived in 2016), but there might still be enough to the base Pixel 10 to make fans don a conical hat and blow a party horn. For one thing, this is the first non-Pro Pixel phone to boast a telephoto lens. It is a 5x optical zoom lens, but it supports 10x optical image quality with the help of cropping and computational photography. Using the Super Res Zoom feature can give you a 20x zoom equivalent. Along with the telephoto lens, the Pixel 10 has 48MP wide and 13MP ultrawide sensors on the rear, as well as a 10.5MP selfie lens. As with the other phones in this year's lineup, the Pixel 10 runs on the Google Tensor G5 chip. It's said to be 34 percent faster than the Tensor G4 chipset and it's the first chipset that runs the Gemini Nano model. According to Google, that supports more than 20 generative AI experiences that run locally. The user interface is in line for some changes too. The company says Material 3 will support expressive photo wallpapers, customizable quick settings and improved typography. All of that should look pretty good on the Actua display, which delivers up to 3,000 nits of brightness. Google also claims that the Pixel 10's battery can power the device for more than 30 hours, up from the 24-plus hours for which the Pixel 9 lineup was rated. When you use a 30W adapter, you'll be able to charge the Pixel 10 to 55 percent of its capacity (i.e. 16-plus hours of use) in 30 minutes. In addition, the handset boasts a satin metal finish, Gorilla Glass Victus 2 and an IP68 rating for dust and water resistance. The Pixel 10 will shelves on August 28. It starts at $799 and will be available in Obsidian, Frost, Lemongrass and Indigo colorways. Read more about the Pixel 10 . Pixel 10 Pro / Pro 10 XL Sam Rutherford for Engadget How would you like that thing we just told you about but with higher specs and maybe a larger display? The Pixel 10 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro XL each boast a 50MP wide lens, a 48MP ultrawide and a 48MP 5x telephoto lens. Google claims this is its best camera system in a smartphone to date. There's more memory in these models too, with 16GB of RAM versus 12GB in the base Pixel 10. (The Pixel 10 Pro Fold has 16GB of RAM too.) The Super Actua displays are about 10 percent brighter than on the Pixel 9 Pro series, with 2,200 nits of full-screen brightness or 3,300 peak when viewing HDR content, and that's while consuming less power than previous models. The Pixel 10 Pro has a 6.3-inch screen while the Pixel 10 Pro XL has a 6.8-inch display, and each has a variable refresh rate of up to 120Hz. As with the base Pixel 10, the Pro models are slated to have more than 30 hours of battery life on a single charge. The Pixel 10 Pro supports 30W fast charging, while you can top up a Pixel 10 Pro XL with 45W of fast charging. Both support Qi2, but in what's said to be a first for a phone, the 10 Pro XL offers 25W wireless charging via Qi2.2 compatibility. The Pixel 10 Pro XL has upgraded speakers too, with what Google claims is loud and powerful bass, along with full and balanced stereo audio. The Pixel 10 Pro and 10 Pro XL will be available in Moonstone, Jade, Porcelain and Obsidian colorways on August 28, with pre-orders opening up today. The Pixel 10 Pro starts at $999 for 128GB of storage and the Pixel 10 Pro XL will run you $1,199 for 256GB of storage. Read more about the Pixel 10 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro XL. Pixel 10 Pro Fold Sam Rutherford for Engadget Of course, there's a fourth phone in the Pixel 10 lineup this fall. Google made durability a priority on the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, which has an IP68 rating for dust and water resistance (a first for a foldable, the company says). A new gearless hinge will help with that — Google says it's twice as durable as the hinge in the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. In fact, the company claims the Pixel 10 Pro Fold is designed to handle over 10 years of folding. The internal, eight-inch Super Actua Reflex display (said to be the largest on any phone), and outer 6.4-inch Actua display both deliver up to 3,000 nits of brightness. Google says it redesigned the interior with resilient, ultra-thin glass, along with dual anti-impact layers to help protect it from drops. The Pixel 10 Pro Fold is said to have the largest battery in a foldable yet, with a 5,015mAh capacity. As with the rest of the Pixel 10 lineup, there's Qi2 wireless charging support — an apparent first for a foldable. Alternatively, you'll be able to charge the battery to half of its capacity in 30 minutes with a 30W adapter, Google says. The triple-camera array includes a new 48MP main sensor, along with a 10.5MP ultrawide lens with macro focus and a 10.8MP telephoto lens. A feature called Instant View will show recently-taken pictures alongside the viewfinder. Google says it improved multitasking as well, with split-screen functionality that supports app resizing and the option to drag and drop files. The Pixel 10 Pro Fold comes in Moonstone and Jade colorways, but it'll arrive later than the rest of the Pixel 10 family — it's scheduled to land on October 9. It starts at $1,799 for 256GB of storage. If you're willing to splash out more cash, though, you can have up to 1TB of onboard storage, the first time that's been an option in a Pixel Pro Fold. Read more about the Pixel 10 Pro Fold. Pixelsnap Sam Rutherford for Engadget As mentioned above, all of the Pixel 10 devices have Qi2 wireless charging capabilities built-in, but Google is expanding on that with its own, long-awaited spin on MagSafe. Google's take is called Pixelsnap. The company is offering a slew of magnetic accessories for Pixel 10 devices, including cases, a charging puck, charging stand and non-charging ring stand. Read more about Pixelsnap . AI updates Sam Rutherford for Engadget This being Google in the Gregorian calendar year of 2025, of course there are a bunch of AI features coming to the Pixel 10 lineup (some should trickle down to older models later). Magic Cue might be the handiest of the latest tools. This is said to deliver proactive suggestions based on your activity by pulling data from the likes of Gmail and Google Calendar. For instance, if you're calling your airline, Magic Cue might pull up your flight details. If a friend asks for the address of your Airbnb vacation rental, Magic Cue could bring that up to save you some time. There are plenty of other AI tools on the way to Pixel 10 devices. I am an abysmal photographer, so Camera Coach sounds like it could be a genuinely useful feature for people like me. When you point the cameras at a subject or scene you want to capture, Gemini kicks into gear to analyze what the lenses are picking up. The feature will offer composition and framing suggestions, and suggest camera modes to employ. Gemini Live can offer visual guidance with on-screen overlays. Meanwhile, the Guided Frame feature will describe what the camera sees, primarily to assist blind and low-vision users. This is said to work on any scene and seems (at least on the surface) similar to services like Be My Eyes . Sam Rutherford for Engadget Other Pixel 10 AI camera tools include Auto Best Take, which can seemingly pick out the best group photo from multiple options. As for adjusting images, the Conversational Editing feature harnesses Gemini to help you tweak things using natural language voice prompts. You might ask it to adjust lighting, change the framing of a shot or remove objects, and hopefully Gemini will be able to handle those without a hitch. In addition, Pixel 10 devices are the first phones to implement C2PA (Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity) content credentials directly in the camera app. This is an industry standard labeling system for content that's created or modified using generative AI. Elsewhere, Pixel translation tools could be in line for a serious upgrade with Voice Translate. Google says this feature will be able to translate calls in real-time in your own voice. Google has folded a new native audio model into Gemini Live that's said to control the emotional tone and be capable of detecting a user's emotions. AI could help you better manage your calls too. The Call Message function will keep missed and declined calls separate from spam, and offer real-time transcripts as well as suggestions for next steps. Gboard writing tools, Pixel Studio and NotebookLM integration are in line for updates too. Sam Rutherford for Engadget Last but not least, Pixel 10 devices have a Pixel Journal app that will remain private ( following in Apple's footsteps to a degree). The app harnesses AI to offer prompts that may help you track your progress and record your thoughts. Read more about the Pixel 10 AI features. Pixel Watch 4 Sam Rutherford for Engadget Let's move on from phones and take a gander at Google's latest smartwatch. The Pixel Watch 4 has a new dome-style display that's 10 percent larger than the screen on the Pixel Watch 3. It can reach up to 3,000 nits of brightness. Battery life is said to be improved too, with Google claiming it can power the wearable for up to 40 hours on a single charge. Google has also made it easier to replace the screen and battery this time around too, though we'll have to see it in person before we can judge how easy it is to actually do. Other features include satellite connectivity for emergencies (when you're out of range of Wi-Fi and cell towers), an electrocardiogram app and irregular heart rhythm notifications. Google says the Pixel Watch 4 will be able to detect when a wearer's heart stops beating and contact emergency services. There will also be an AI-based personal fitness coach . Fitbit Premium subscribers will be the first to gain access to that. The Pixel Watch 4 will be available in in two sizes, 41mm and 45mm. It starts at $349 and will hit shelves on October 9. Read more about the Pixel Watch 4 and AI personal fitness coach . Pixel Buds 2a and Pixel Buds Pro 2 updates Sam Rutherford for Engadget Google hasn't forgotten about its earbuds here either. The company is releasing the the Pixel Buds 2a with active noise cancellation (ANC), powered by a Tensor A1 chip. Even with this upgrade, these are Google's lightest and smallest A-Series earbuds to date. They're IP54 rated for dust and water resistance, while the charging case has an IPX4 rating. The Tensor A1 chip is also said to deliver improved quality for calls and other audio, while supporting Gemini and other AI features in the Pixel Buds 2a. These earbuds are said to have double the battery life of their predecessors at 10 hours on a single charge, with the case adding 17 hours of listening time (seven and 13 hours, respectively, when ANC is enabled). The Pixel Buds 2a will be available on October 9 in Hazel and Iris colorways. However, due to these upgrades, the Pixel Buds 2a will cost $130, which is $31 more than the previous generation. Meanwhile, Google is offering the Pixel Buds Pro 2 in a new colorway, Moonstone, to match some of the Pixel 10 devices. A software update in September will introduce more features to the Pixel Buds Pro 2, including protection from certain sudden loud noises, the ability to adjust audio based on the volume of your surroundings, a way to answer or dismiss calls with head gestures and advanced audio processing for Gemini Live. Read more about the Pixel Buds 2a and Pixel Buds Pro 2 updates . Hands-on with the Pixel 10 lineup and Pixel Watch 4 Sam Rutherford for Engadget Ahead of the Made by Google event, we had a chance to go hands-on with the new devices.

    "summary": "Software has always been an integral part of the Pixel experience, and that's not changing with the new Pixel 10 family . At its Made by Google event today in New York, Google detailed a suite of new machine learning and AI features that will debut with the Pixel 10 series before making their way to earlier models. The first new tool most people are likely to encounter is Magic Cue. As you're texting your friends, Gemini Nano , Google's private on-device model, will populate the conversation with contextual suggestions. For example, if a friend asks about a dinner reservation you two made last week, the Pixel 10 will display a shortcut you can tap to send them a Google Maps listing. Magic Cue depends on there being a digital paper trail to work. You can long press the shortcuts it generates to see where Gemini sourced the information it's relaying to you. In the case of the example above, it may have come from your personal Gmail. Sam Rutherford for Engadget The feature has extensions throughout Android. For instance, if a family member texts you about a flight you two are about to take, Magic Cue will not only provide the number of the airline, it will also display information about your flight on screen for easy reference. On the Discover page, which you can access on nearly every Android device by swiping to the leftmost page of your phone's home screen, there's a new shortcut to a feature called the Daily Hub. Like Samsung's Now Brief , it's a page with an AI-generated summary of the upcoming day. At the top, you'll see a greeting, with a weather forecast and and any upcoming events on your calendar. Below that, there will be a list of reminders pulled from Gmail, Keep and other Google apps. If you keep scrolling, you'll also find recommended articles and videos from YouTube. Sam Rutherford for Engadget For those who also want to reflect at the end of their day, there's a new Journal app too. It has AI features built throughout. For instance, as you're writing an entry, it will automatically suggest images to include from your photo library. Additionally, the app will attempt to automatically categorize your entries based on topics you've designated. Google has used emoji for this part of the interface, which make it easy to see at a glance what you wrote about from the app's monthly view. Over in Photos, Google has introduced a feature called Conversational Editing. It allows you to tweak an image by describing to your phone how you want it modified. For example, say you took a selfie of yourself in a busy tourist location. You can tell Photos — using your voice, your phone's on-screen keyboard or a suggested prompt — to edit all the strangers out of the scene. After a few moments, the on-device model will produce a new image, with the original displayed alongside it so you can compare the two. It's possible to build multiple edits on top of one another, and if you don't like the latest edit, you can go back. Sam Rutherford for Engadget In the camera app, there are a handful of new AI features . First, there's Camera Coach, which will examine the shot you're about to snap. It will read the scene and make suggestions on the angle and lighting to use, as well what capture mode is best for the situation. Another new AI feature, dubbed Auto Best Take, finds and combines similar photos so that everyone in a group shot looks their best. Lastly, Google updated last year's Add Me feature to make it easier to include the photographer in even larger groups. Elsewhere, Google is introducing a few upgrades to its Gemini Live visual assistant that build on the base the company debuted last year. To start, there are new visual indicators that will mask part of your phone's screen to make it easier to see what Gemini is referring to when it answers a question. This feature will be available first on Pixel 10 devices before rolling out to other Android phones and iOS devices later. Separately, Google says it will soon release a new model that \"dramatically\" improves how Gemini uses key elements of human speech. For instance, you'll be able to tell the assistant to speak slowly if you're jotting down notes, and it will change its tone depending on the emotional nature of the topic you're discussing. The Pixel 10 family is available to per-order today , with general availability of the Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro XL to follow on August 28. The Pixel 10 Pro Fold , Pixel Watch 4 and Pixel Buds 2a won't arrive at retail until October 9.

    "summary": "After the usual months of rumors and anticipation, Google has officially launched the new Pixel 10 Pro and 10 Pro XL at its Made by Google event. The new generation flagship devices carry packed spec sheets with impressive upgrades from the Pixel 9 Pro . Perhaps the most exciting among them is the addition of Pixelsnap , which supports Google's new ecosystem of Qi2-compatible chargers that magnetically align to the back of the phone. Beyond just the convenience, Qi2 compatibility should offer faster wireless charging speeds, too. This functionality had been conspicuously missing from flagship Android devices until now, and spawns a whole new world of accessories that can snap onto the back of the Pixel. Google's flagship phones have long been known for delivering excellent photos, and these new Pixel's continue that tradition. Both models carry a triple rear camera system with a 50MP wide lens, a 48MP ultrawide with macro, and an “upgraded” 48MP 5x telephoto lens. It’s not clear yet what’s new about that telephoto camera, as it has the same f/2.8 aperture and 22-degree field of view as the one on the Pixel 9 Pro series. ProRes support is standard for more serious photo editors. The 6.3-inch Pixel 10 Pro and the 6.8-inch Pixel 10 Pro XL will both feature a Super Actua display with variable refresh rate up to 120 Hz. The displays offer up to 3,300 nits of peak brightness or 2,200 nits peak in HDR, about ten percent brighter than on the Pixel 9 Pro series. Both models boast their largest batteries yet with over 30 hours of battery life, which represents a roughly 25 percent boost over the last generation. The Pixel 10 Pro supports 30W fast charging while the Pro XL supports 45W. While both phones support the Qi2 standard, the 10 Pro XL is the first phone to support Qi2.2 with 25W wireless charging. The standard 10 Pro is limited to 15W wireless charging. Both sizes will be sold with 16GB of RAM. The Pro and Pro XL will both sport the Google Tensor G5 chip, which powers new on-board AI features coming to the entire Pixel 10 lineup. Key among them is Magic Cue, which can provide relevant information to the user by understanding when it's needed, like pulling up your flight info when you're calling the airline. Camera Coach is another AI-powered feature that will help users take better photographs by helping them find the best angle or lighting. Both sizes will be available in four color choices, those being Moonstone, Jade, Porcelain and Obsidian. The Pixel 10 Pro will launch at $999 for the 128GB model, and the Pixel 10 Pro XL will launch at $1,199 with 256GB of storage (double what the Pixel 9 Pro XL included). The new Pixel Pro line is available for pre-orders today and will hit shelves on August 28.

    "summary": "Google just announced the Pixel Watch 4 at the Made by Google event . The upcoming smartwatch features a newly-designed domed display that's ten percent larger than the Pixel Watch 3's screen. It can also reach 3,000 nits of brightness. The battery life is impressive here, with the company saying it should last up to 40 hours per charge. That's enough time to use the watch all day and night, for those who want to track their sleep every once in a while. It also offers 25 percent faster charging when compared to the previous model. Google The Pixel Watch 4 gives customers access to SOS satellite communications, which lets users connect to emergency services via the device. This works even when cellular and Wi-Fi coverage isn't available. The feature first launched with the Pixel 9 series of smartphones . It's the first smartwatch by Google \"designed with serviceability in mind.\" This means that it's easier to replace the battery and screen. The Pixel Watch 4 tracks over 40 exercises, including yoga and kickboxing. There's an AI-based personal fitness coach that arrives first for Fitbit Premium users after the watch launches. As for health metrics, the smartwatch has an ECG app and offers irregular heart rhythm notifications. There's also a brand-new feature that detects when a heart stops beating, which automatically connects users to emergency services. All health metrics can be tracked via an integrated dashboard. Google Of course, the watch was designed with Google Gemini in mind. There's a new speaker for communication and a raise-to-talk functionality. The company says that Gemini will leverage data \"from apps across your device\" to answer questions. The Pixel Watch 4 comes in two sizes (41mm and 45mm) and integrates with a full range of accessories, including various bands. The company is introducing new watch faces and changed up the design of some pre-existing watch faces. It'll be available for purchase on October 9, with prices starting at $349.

    "summary": "Google just announced the Pixel 10 Pro Fold smartphone at the Made by Google event . This latest foldable offers some novel features, especially when compared to rival handsets like the recently-released Galaxy Z Fold 7 . The Pixel 10 Pro Fold offers an IP68 rating for dust and water resistance. This is pretty significant for dust, as the Z Fold 7 has just an IP48 rating. IP68 is a good rating and essentially means that the unit will be completely dustproof and can withstand being submerged in water deeper than one meter for around 30 minutes. The Pixel 9 Pro Fold offered an IPX8 rating, which is the same metric for water but a much poorer rating for dust. The Pixel 10 Pro Fold also includes Qi2 wireless charging, and it's the first foldable to offer this feature. That'll pair nicely with Google's just-announced PixelSnap platform, which is the company's answer to Apple's MagSafe. Google The general specs are solid here. It ships with a 6.4-inch external OLED display and an 8-inch internal display when unfolded. The hinge is made from high-grade aluminum alloy and the external display features a Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 cover. The battery lasts for around 24 hours, but Google's Extreme Battery Saver software can extend that all the way up to 84 hours. We'll have to test that when we run the handset through its paces. It can also charge up to 50 percent in just 30 minutes. There's a triple rear camera system, including a 48MP wide lens, a 10.5MP ultrawide lens with macro focus and a 10.8MP telephoto lens. It ships with a Google Tensor G5 chip, 16GB of RAM and up to 1TB in storage. The bad news? The Pixel 10 Pro Fold won't be available until October 9, while the other Pixel phones drop on August 29. Like most foldables, this handset is on the expensive side. Prices start at $1,799.

    "summary": "Alongside the Pixel Watch 4 (and family of Pixel 10 devices), Google also introduced a new “personal health coach” today at its Made By Google event. A preview of it will begin rolling out in October as part of the Fitbit app to Premium users in the US. The app is also getting a redesign which the company says will be “available with the latest Fitbit trackers, Fitbit smart watches and Pixel watches.” The first thing Fitbit users may notice is a visual refresh. In place of the current organization system, the bottom of the screen will feature four tabs: Today, Fitness, Sleep and Health. The home page (Today) will still feature daily progress stats in the form of bars and rings at the top, though these are now customizable so you can display your favorite metrics there. Below this is a feed of your upcoming workouts, recent activity and progress reports served in individual cards that you can tap into for more information. This layout, with data visualizations at the top and a feed that follows, is the same across all four tabs. Google At a recent demo, the company’s director of product management for Fitbit and health Andy Abramson showed us how his app surfaced his weekly cardio load in a ring, with bars to its right for his steps, readiness and sleep performance. “We call these our focus metrics,” he said. These are in a color scheme that will be familiar to Fitbit users, with purple continuing to be the color representing sleep data and teal for steps. But there’s a few more updates that Google says “address common user suggestions,” and these include easier layouts, more intuitive data visualization, “improved syncing — and of course, dark mode.” Google didn’t just give the Fitbit app a makeover. It said that coaching and AI were at the core of the redesign, and that the “entire app was rebuilt so the health coach can understand your goals, build your plan, contextualize your metrics and bring insights at the right moments.” Abramson said that his team sought to figure out “How do we put the AI coach in every part of the app?” Instead of simply tucking the AI features into a dedicated tab, “We actually need to tie it together.” To that end, a floating “Ask Coach” button is on every page of the app at the bottom right, and tapping it will take you into a conversation window with the Gemini-powered AI. This button is accessible across all the tabs in the updated app, and you can ask it questions about all the data you’ve provided to Fitbit. On your first time using the new app, you’ll be prompted to have a conversation with the AI coach, where it will ask about your goals, available equipment and any preferences, injuries or other relevant medical history. Those will go into an area called “Coach Notes,” that you can access in the Health tab and see what the app knows about you. There, you can delete things you don’t want in there any more. Cherlynn Low for Engadget If you only have a few free weights and a rowing machine, for example, the coach can build a custom plan that suggests a variety of weights-based exercises interspersed with sessions on your rower. But if you tell it at any point that you might be looking to incorporate outdoor runs into your routine, it can do so. Abramson told the app he wanted to get better at trail runs, for example, and in the version of the app I saw, that guidance affected a lot of the recommendations he was served. As he had told it he was traveling and had access to a hotel gym, it also suggested some activities on the facility’s Peloton bike. In future versions of the AI coach, you might be able to integrate with Gemini Live and point your camera around your (or your hotel’s) gym to get the system to identify what equipment is available and generate suggestions based on that. For now, all input to the app is limited to text, which means you may still need to know the difference between a barbell, a Y-bell and a dumbbell. The coach will build programs based on the info you supply, and these will come with detailed instructions and “metric targets that focus on weekly progression.” If you’re familiar with the cardio load and readiness score features that Google and Fitbit have rolled out in recent years, it’s easy to see how the concept has been developing over time. Your activity progress should not be judged on a daily basis — too many variables could affect whether you were able to get in a run or 10,000 steps on any given day. Instead, a more forgiving and holistic approach would be to consider weekly movement. If, like me, you tend to get in two cardio days, two strength days and one HIIT day a week, you won’t be penalized for not getting cardio in on a weights day. Or say you put in too many hours at work one day, writing a long article late into the night. The AI coach will recognize that you didn’t get as much sleep as usual and adjust your target cardio load accordingly. Google said the coach will make “real-time check-ins and adjustments” and that if you let the system know you’ve hurt your back, it will give you tips on how to modify your workouts. Google Part of the update to the Fitbit app includes new sleep algorithms that Google says make it more accurate, providing “a more precise understanding of your sleep duration and stages.” The coach also guides you to get better sleep, by studying your patterns over the week and sharing insights on how to improve things over time. If it notices that on weekdays you take a longer time than usual to fall asleep, for example, it might recommend heading to bed or turning off your devices earlier. If it thinks you might be jetlagged, it could suggest sleep schedules to help you re-adjust to new timezones. Finally, the sleep coach might look at your energy expenditure each day and recommend a bedtime that could get you 30 minutes of extra rest to get over a particularly grueling workout you undertook that morning. In time, the Fitbit coach will get data from a variety of sources, as it will support Health Connect and HealthKit to get things like your glucose levels or your weight and body composition from your smart scale or other connected devices. Google also says that in addition to helping you get personalized insights based on your activity and rest, its AI coach can help make sense of an overwhelming amount of data noise. That’s not just the information overload from all the different metrics your wearable might collect, but also the fact that there is a ton of content out there today that Google says is “written for everyone in general and no one in particular.” Since it has access to a wealth of data about you and a gigantic knowledge base from the internet, the coach can filter out noise to give you pertinent answers to your questions. You can ask things like “I’m feeling stressed right now. What can I do?” or “What are the best exercises for weight loss” and, according to Google, “get truly personalized answers that are backed by science.” The system will also serve up timely and regular reports on your performance and any trends or changes. Using AI to make sense of the overwhelming amount of data collected by our wearables seems like a smart approach, but it’s not without its drawbacks or concerns. Will your sensitive information be safely guarded? What type of information will the AI Coach serve and how trustworthy is that guidance? Google Google appears to be attempting to get ahead of those concerns, saying it is “committed to building our personal health coach with leading industry experts and through scientific research.” It’s partnered with Stephen Curry “and his performance team,” and is “working closely with our Consumer Health Advisory Panel, a diverse group of leading experts in medicine, AI and behavioral science.” I think it’s imperative that Google state very clearly that its AI Coach can not replace a doctor, a registered dietitian or a certified coach, and that it has guardrails in place to prevent aggressively pushing a person towards dangerous outcomes. The good news is, Google is well aware that it will have work to do, and is clear that it is “releasing this experience as a preview so you can help shape it as we make regular improvements.” For now, the AI is designed to help with fitness and sleep insights and recommendations, though it’s worth noting that Fitbit has historically considered a broader range of areas including mental health and menstrual cycles as essential components of overall wellbeing. In future, the AI Coach may also cover those types of data. If you’re keen to test the redesigned Fitbit app and new personal health coach out, you’ll have to be a Fitbit Premium subscriber, be based in the US and sign up to get notified when the preview is available in October.

    "summary": "The Pixel 10 marks the 10th generation of Google's homegrown smartphone efforts. This year, alongside a new Tensor G5 chip, the company has included some upgrades that might make the base model the star of the family. The standard Pixel 10: Now with a dedicated zoom for the first time Aside from updated color options (obsidian, indigo, frost and lemongrass), the standard Pixel 10 doesn't look too much different from last year's phone. It still has a matte aluminum frame and a 6.3-inch OLED screen with a 120Hz refresh rate. For 2025, Google has upped the brightness of its Actua display to a peak of 3,000 nits (up from 2,700 nits). Google also claims the Pixel 10's speakers have been significantly improved, though it was hard to tell by how much during my demo. Inside, changes to the Pixel 10's specs are a bit more robust. The Tensor G5 features a CPU that's 34 percent better year-over-year on top of a new TPU that's 60 percent faster than before. Memory and storage are staying the same at 12GB of RAM and either 128GB or 256GB of storage, though it's important to note that battery capacity has increased to 4,970mAh (up from 4,700mAh). That latter figure is even more than what you get from the Pixel 10 Pro (4,870mAh). But by far, the biggest upgrade on the standard Pixel 10 is a new 10.8MP camera with a 5x optical zoom, joining the existing 48MP main and 13MP ultrawide cams. This is the first time Google has ever put a dedicated zoom lens on a base Pixel, which is a huge value add because previously anyone who wanted a telephoto camera had to pay extra for one of the premium models. And based on what I saw in person and its specs, its telephoto camera appears to be similar to what we got in last year's Pixel 9 Pro Fold, so even if it's not quite as powerful as what's available on the Pixel 10 Pros, it's still a great addition to the base model. Furthermore, when compared to the standard Galaxy S25 , the Pixel 10 suddenly has a significant hardware advantage thanks to a bigger battery (just 4,000 mAh on the Samsung), a longer zoom (5x vs 3x) and slightly faster wired charging (up to 30 watts on the Pixel instead of just 25W). Plus, both phones come with the same seven years of Android updates and security patches. Sam Rutherford for Engadget That said, it remains to be seen if the Tensor G5 can match the general overall performance of the Snapdragon 8 Elite chips used in Samsung phones. That has always been a shortcoming of Google's homegrown silicon. But for pretty much everything else, the base Pixel 10 is looking like a much more complete device and a great option for anyone looking to save some money, since its price is staying the same at $799. Pixel 10 Pro and Pro XL: Even better specs and some Pro-only camera tricks As for the $999 Pixel 10 Pro and $1,199 Pro XL, like their smaller sibling, their appearance hasn't changed too much. The easiest way to tell them apart from the base model is that the Pros have a shiny frame instead of matte and slightly different colors: obsidian, moonstone, porcelain and jade. Their 6.3- and 6.8-inch Super Actua displays have gotten a similar bump in brightness up to 3,300 nits (up from 3,000 nits), while memory and storage have received a boost as well, up to 16GB of RAM and as much as 1TB of storage. Unfortunately, even though the Pixel 10 Pro XL now supports wired charging at up to 45 watts, the 10 Pro remains capped at 30. Sam Rutherford for Engadget Of course, with the base Pixel 10 getting a new zoom lens, Google couldn't forget about the Pro models. The Pixel 10 Pro and Pro XL's cameras have the same resolution as before: a 50MP main, 48MP ultra-wide and a 48MP telephoto with 5x optical zoom. However, Google has made some tweaks that include a new ISP, an improved optical image stabilization system and some additional tools like the ability to shoot portrait mode shots in full resolution, a first for the Pixel family. However, my favorite new feature here is Pro Res Zoom, an upgraded version of Super Res Zoom that can capture long-distance shots at up to 100x while using machine learning to fill in the gaps. Google says its algorithm pays special attention to things like people's faces, so hopefully we don't run into any AI slop. From what I've seen, Pro Res Zoom works remarkably well, especially when you consider that everything is happening on-device instead of sending images to the cloud for additional processing. Seeing this kind of sharpness at up to 100x from a 5x optical zoom is damn impressive, even if the Pixel is getting an assist from AI. New software, camera and AI features Sam Rutherford for Engadget Naturally, this wouldn't be a Pixel launch without a bunch of new software and AI-powered tricks. Sadly, there are so many new tools that I didn't have a chance to do a deep dive into all of them. The feature with the most potential might be Magic Cue, which uses AI to surface helpful information like addresses, reservations and more directly inside some of your most commonly used apps like Google Messages and Gmail. These prompts appear as little rainbow bubbles and you can tap on them to quickly send relevant info to others. When dealing with a flight, Magic Cue can call the related airline for you. Meanwhile, Google's Daily Hub functions a lot like Samsung's Now Brief feature, which puts handy reminders, calendar appointments and more all in a single place. This gives you a quick overview of important things happening each day. Alternatively, if you want to be a bit more introspective, the Pixel Journal feature is essentially a digital diary that's meant to help you reflect on important events or surface new topics that may be relevant to your interests. Elsewhere, there's a new on-the-fly translation feature that can mimic the sound of your own voice during calls. Gemini Live is also getting a visual overlay so it can better highlight things on your screen and clearly point out what it sees. And then there's Take a Message, which is kind of like Call Screener but for missed calls. For photography, Google showed off the ability to use natural language voice commands to edit images or add completely new elements to a pic (like putting sunglasses on an alpaca). Best Take has also been improved to analyze up to 150 frames before you even hit the shutter in group shots, allowing the phone to pick out an image where everyone is smiling. But if that doesn't happen, it can use AI to create a composite photo with the best expressions across a series of shots. Also, across the Pixel 10 line, Google is supporting the C2PA standard , so that there will be no guessing which images have been made or tweaked with AI and which ones are all natural (at least for things created in first-party apps). And finally, launching as a preview later this fall, there's a new Camera Coach tool that uses AI to help you frame your shots, improve your composition or even suggest some new angles and ideas (Google calls it Get Inspired). The feature offers step-by-step instructions on how to recreate a specific shot. Pixelsnap: Finally, official Qi2 support from a major Android phone maker Sam Rutherford for Engadget The last major upgrade is the addition of proper Qi2 wireless charging support. Google is calling this Pixelsnap, but it's based on the same underlying spec used in iPhones and other Qi2-compatible devices and it will be available on the entire Pixel 10 family. The one quirk is that while the Pixel 10 Pro XL can wirelessly charge at up to 25 watts, the base Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro are still limited to just 15 watts. On top of that, Google will have a handful of Pixelsnap accessories, including a charging mount with a removable Pixelsnap puck, a magnetic ring stand and more. Regardless, after major Android phone makers failed to add Qi2 support to last year's flagships , I'm glad Google is finally coming around, even if it took longer than I'd like. Not only does this open up the Pixel 10 line to the wide world of magnetic accessories, with a big name like Google hopping on the trend, it puts more pressure on companies like Samsung to properly adopt the standard instead of its devices being merely \" Qi2 ready \" (aka, Qi2 but without a built-in magnetic mounting point). Early thoughts Sam Rutherford for Engadget All told, I really like what Google is doing with the Pixel 10 line. The addition of a proper zoom camera on the base model is a blessing for people who might not want to pay the $200 premium for the Pro versions. It’s also great because I think the matte finish on the standard Pixel 10 looks better than the polished frame on the Pixel 10 Pro. And that goes double for the indigo variant, which is a callback to the original deep blue hue we saw back on the first Pixel from 2016. As a fan of long-distance photography, I really like the addition of Pro Res Zoom, though I do want to test it some more to see the limits of Google's AI magnification. It kind of bugs me that the Pixel 10 Pro XL has faster wired and wireless charging, as those specs really ought to be the same across both Pro models. And while the Tensor G5 seems to be much speedier than any of Google's previous chips, I'm very curious as to how much better it'll feel in the real world, particularly for stuff like gaming. But as a whole, the Pixel 10 family is shaping up to be some of the most well-rounded smartphones Google has ever made. The Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro XL are available for pre-order today starting at $799, $999 and $1,199 with official sales beginning on August 27.

    "summary": "Apple brought active noise cancellation (ANC) to its \"regular\" AirPods last year, and for 2025, Google is doing the same. Google announced the Pixel Buds 2a ($130) today alongside its slate of Pixel 10 phones, marking the first time the company's so-called A-Series earbuds have come equipped with ANC. Google also took design cues from its pricier Pixel Buds Pro 2 while outfitting this new model with a Tensor A1 chip. Sadly, all of the upgrades come with a price increase as the Pixel Buds 2a are $30 more than the previous version. For the 2a's design overhaul, Google ditched the \"stabilizer arc\" for the \"twist-to-adjust stabilizer\" from the Pixel Buds Pro 2. Like before, the company promises this element allows you to have both a secure and a more relaxed fit on the same earbuds simply by rotating them one way or the other. In terms of overall size, the Pixel Buds 2a are the lightest and smallest A-Series earbuds thus far. What's more, this new version is IP54 rated for dust and water resistance (buds only), which is an improvement over the A-Series' IPX4 rating. The charging case didn't have any ingress protection previously, but it's now IPX4. The biggest update on the Pixel Buds 2a is the addition of ANC that's paired with Google's Silent Seal 1.5. As you might expect, transparency mode is available when you need to tune in to your surroundings. That ANC should help you to hear the retooled acoustics and 11mm dynamic drivers better, including spatial audio and customized sound via a 5-band EQ. The Tensor A1 chip is the component that's in the Pixel Buds Pro 2. Here, it provides improved performance across audio and calls. Google says the chip processes audio 90 times faster than the speed of sound, adapting to changes in your environment to cancel noisy distractions. Plus, the Tensor A1 allows you to use Gemini and other AI features with the Pixel Buds 2a. Google doubled the battery life on this new model compared to the Pixel Buds A-Series. You can now expect up to 10 hours of use on the earbuds with another 17 hours in the case. With ANC enabled, those figures drop to seven hours and 13 hours, respectively. So even with noise cancellation turned on, battery life on the Pixel Buds 2a is still better than the previous model. The Pixel Buds 2a are available for pre-order starting today for $130. General availability is scheduled for October 9 and you can choose between Hazel (pictured) and Iris color options.

    "summary": "This year, you don't have to splurge on a top-tier Pixel phone to get optical zoom. The camera bar on the standard Pixel 10 includes a 5x telephoto lens, a first for the series. Qi2 charging also comes to the series with Google's MagSafe-like Pixelsnap accessory ecosystem. The $799 handset is powered by the Tensor G5 chip, which powers new on-device AI features. Google says the Pixel 10's 48 MP 5x telephoto lens can produce 10x optical image quality. However, that's using a combination of optical zoom, cropping and computational photography. If you want pure optical zoom, 5x is all you get. Google's Super Res Zoom (combining multiple frames to enhance detail) takes it up to a 20x zoom equivalent. If you don't mind leaning on its digital trickery, the phone could be a solid choice for concert or wildlife photography. The zoom lens is joined by 48 MP wide and 13 MP ultrawide lenses. On the front is a 10.5 MP selfie camera. Google All Pixel 10 phones have built-in Qi2 wireless charging . This finally brings MagSafe-like capabilities to Android flagships, five years after Apple added it to the iPhone . (The Galaxy S25 series supports Qi2 but without built-in magnets .) Google is launching an array of magnetic accessories, dubbed Pixelsnap. This includes $50 Pixel 10 cases, a $40 charging puck, a $70 charging stand and a $30 (non-charging) ring stand. Google says the Pixel 10's battery will last longer than the Pixel 9's. The company rates the new model for 30+ hours of use. (Last year's Pixels were rated for 24+ hours.) The Pixel 10 can also charge to 55 percent in 30 minutes when using a 30W adapter. Under the hood is Google's Tensor G5 chip, which powers all of the Pixel 10 series. The company says its CPU is 34 percent faster than the Tensor G4. The phone has 12GB of RAM and 128GB / 256GB storage tiers, the same as the Pixel 9. Google The Tensor G5 powers a new on-device AI feature called Magic Cue, which offers proactive suggestions. Google says Magic Cue can bring up your flight details when you call your airline. Or, it can pull up your Airbnb address when a friend asks for it. This aligns with the AI as a context-sensitive concierge approach that device makers are moving toward. Meanwhile, Camera Coach falls into the automate everything, no skill required category of AI. When you aim the camera, the feature uses Gemini models to analyze the scene. It then provides framing and composition suggestions. It can also recommend the best camera modes to use. Google There are plenty more AI features onboard. There's a new audio model for Gemini Live . It's said to detect your emotion and control the assistant's emotional tone. (It sounds a bit creepy in theory, but we'll reserve judgment until we try it.) Then there's Pixel Journal, a private app with AI-generated prompts for recording thoughts. (It's launching first in Europe and English.) Finally, Voice Translate brings Google Meet's live translation feature to your phone calls. It translates calls to other languages in real time, simulating the users' voices. Wild stuff. The Pixel 10 has a satin metal finish (\"spacecraft-grade aluminum\") with Gorilla Glass Victus 2. The phone has an IP68 rating for dust and water resistance. The Google Pixel 10 arrives on August 28. It starts at $799 for 128GB storage. You can order it in obsidian, frost, lemongrass and indigo colors.

    "summary": "With the arrival of the Pixel 10, the spotlight is on the cameras that Google's phones are known for . Compared to the Pixel 9's dramatic camera bump , however, this year's improvements are mainly iterative. The base model got the biggest hardware update with the addition of a third camera. Otherwise, Google focused mainly on AI processing this time, particularly with a new feature designed to help users improve their photos and Gemini AI addition that lets you edit photos using only your voice. For better or worse, a lot of Google's camera enhancements are on the AI side. A key new update is the Gemini AI-powered Camera Coach that aims to help users with photo composition. When enabled, it can read the scene and offer advice for the angle and lighting and even suggest the best mode (Portrait, Night Sight, etc.). Another new AI mode called Auto Best Take finds and combines similar photos into one so everyone in a group shot looks their best. And Google updated the \"Add Me\" feature from last year so you can include the photographer in even bigger groups. Google Google is also using AI to make it easier to edit Pixel 10 images The editor inside Google Photos now provides AI-powered suggestions that combine multiple effects for quick edits, even if you know nothing about photo touchups. Simply ask for a specific edit like \"remove the cars in the background\" or \"restore this old photo.\" The AI will understand the change you're trying to make and use all the tools available to automatically do so. You can then add follow-up instructions for further improvements. Finally, all Pixel 10 models have an updated Portrait mode that offers \"improved segmentation, detail, sharpness, and texture,\" so that photos shot in that mode look less, well, AI generated. The base Pixel devices have played second fiddle to the Pro models in the past. However, the Pixel 10 now has a triple-camera system just like the other models, thanks to the addition of a 10.8MP 5x telephoto lens. That boosts the maximum digital Super Res Zoom up to 20x, double that of the Pixel 9. It's worth noting that a 5x optical zoom is rare on a base model camera — the Galaxy S25 has just a 3x lens, for instance. The other two are a 48MP wide (main) camera with macro focus, compared to a 50MP version before, along with a 13MP ultra-wide. Unfortunately, the latter is a downgrade in terms of resolution from the 48MP ultra-wide shooter on the previous model. Google is promising optical quality at 0.6x, 1x, 5x and 10x zoom levels. The 10.5MP ultra-wide selfie camera with a 95-degree field of view is the same mediocre one as before, though. Google Hardware-wise, the triple-camera systems on the Pixel 10 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro XL models are unchanged in terms of resolution. Both have 50MP wide, 48MP ultra-wide with macro focus and 48MP 5x telephoto lenses, along with 42MP ultra-wide selfie cameras as before. One new feature on both models is the \"Pro Res Zoom\" optimized for the Tensor G5 chip that goes up to 100x, compared to 20x on the Pixel 9 Pro and Pro XL. Since that zoom is digitally enhanced, however, you may see some wonky artifacts. One other change is double the stabilization on the wide camera that's supposed to provide more cinematic footage, according to Google. Not much has changed on the video side, with 8K available on the Pro models only via the Video Boost feature that digitally upscales footage from 4K. Finally, the Pixel 10 Fold has a similar setup to the Pixel 10, with a 48MP wide camera, 10.5MP ultra-wide camera and 10.8MP telephoto with 5x optical zoom. The front and inner cameras are both 10MP f/2.2 models. Sam Rutherford for Engadget Pixel 10 devices will also be the first to implement C2PA content credentials within the native camera app, whether they were created with or without AI. As a reminder, C2PA (Content Provenance and Authenticity) is a standard being used by Meta , Google and others to detect and label changes made by AI. Another key AI accessibility feature called Guided Frame describes what the camera is seeing for blind and low vision users. Finally, it's worth calling out the new Actua 360 display available on all models, particularly the 50 percent extra brightness (up to 3,000 nits peak). That makes photography easier on sunny days as you can better see details in your composition. In sum, it's good to see the Pixel 10 getting some love on the photo side with a triple camera system that matches or beats its competition. The Pixel 10 Pro models are mostly unchanged, however, removing some incentive to upgrade rom the Pixel 9 Pro — though the new AI features look more promising than usual. In any case, you'll get the full picture of the Pixel 10 lineup's cameras with Engadget's upcoming reviews.

    "summary": "Today's Made by Google/Pixel 10 event isn't just about phones (or AI, for that matter). Google has announced several updates for the Pixel Buds Pro 2 as well. Perhaps the most visible change is that the earbuds are available in a new gray colorway called Moonstone. This is perhaps designed with those who like to match the colors of their earbuds and phone in mind, as you can snap up a Pixel 10 in Moonstone as well. Pre-orders for the Pixel Buds Pro 2 in Moonstone open today. In addition, several new features are coming to Pixel Buds Pro 2 in September via a software update. One that's called Loud Noise Protection will automatically dampen the volume of sudden loud noises while you're wearing the earbuds to help protect your hearing. It could work for things like a train passing while you're waiting at a station, but Google says that the feature is \"not suitable to safeguard against sharp, sudden impulse sounds, such as gunshots, explosions or fireworks.\" On a similar note, Adaptive Audio will automatically adjust the volume based on how noisy your physical environment is. Google says it could help to drown out distractions in loud environments so you can better hear what you're listening to, all the while helping make sure you're aware of what's going on around you. You'll soon be able to answer calls using head gestures. With the help of the accelerometer other sensors, the earbuds will be able to detect when you nod or shake your head, and you can use this movement to answer or decline calls and respond to texts. Also coming in September is advanced audio processing for Gemini Live. Google says that, when you're using the AI voice assistant on a compatible Android device (and in a supported language and country), Pixel Buds Pro 2 will be able to eliminate background noise and prioritize your voice so Gemini Live can pick up what you're saying more clearly.

    "summary": "The Pixel 9 Pro Fold was a revelation. Not only did Google switch to a simpler design while adding a larger main display, the company caught up to Samsung's long-running foldable line in just two generations . However, for its third go — the Pixel 10 Pro Fold — Google is opting for a different strategy than we’ve seen recently on the Galaxy Z Fold 7 . Instead of focusing on thinness, Google may have just created the most rugged foldable on the market. That’s due in large part to the phone’s new IP68 rating. Now I will admit that certification might not sound like a huge deal because non-flexy flagships have had this kind of durability for years. But this is the first time any foldable has put both top-tier dust and water resistance together in one device. And when you consider that these kinds of gadgets are generally a bit more fragile than their glass-brick counterparts, that means something. Furthermore, Google says the Pixel 10 Pro Fold’s (P10PF from here on out) 8-inch Super Actua Flex display features a new titanium backplate that adds extra rigidity while a more robust layer of ultra-thin glass provides increased scratch resistance. On the outside, Google went with Gorilla Glass Victus 2 in front and back while installing a new gearless hinge the company claims is designed to handle more than 10 years of bending. Then to top things off, Google equipped the P10PF with a larger 5,015mAh battery, which is a significant jump up from the 4,650mAh cell in its predecessor. Even with all these improvements, the P10PF’s overall dimensions are almost exactly the same as the previous model. Between its weight (9.1 ounces) and thickness (10.8mm folded) though, Google’s foldable is still rather chunky compared Samsung’s newly streamlined Z Fold 7 (8.9mm and 7.5 ounces). Following the major redesign we got last year on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, getting another all-new, super sleek chassis for the P10PF probably wasn’t going to happen. But given the increased durability on this year’s phone, I’m willing to give Google another 12 months to combine this newfound ruggedness with a thinner design. I just hope its engineers don’t get complacent and push things out further than that. Sam Rutherford for Engadget On the inside, the P10PF also boasts upgraded specs and performance with its Tensor G5 chip leading the way. According to Google, its CPU features 34 percent better performance while its TPU fares even better with a 60 percent jump over what we got from the Tensor G4. And just like the rest of the Pixel 10 family, the P10PF supports Google’s Pixelsnap magnetic charging ecosystem, which is fully compatible with the Qi2 protocol. So not only is the Pixel 10 line the first batch of phones from a major Android OEM to support Qi2, the P10PF is also the first foldable phone with this industry standard. Wired charging speeds have increased slightly to 30 watts, but unfortunately wireless charging is staying pat at 15W. Base memory is also staying the same at 16GB of RAM, though there is a wider range of storage options from 256GB to 1TB. Some other small details I appreciate are the P10PF’s slimmer bezels around the outside of its exterior display. It makes the curved corner in the top left look a lot less awkward and it allowed Google to increase its overall size a touch to 6.4 inches across (up from 6.3). On top of that, both of its displays are brighter too, topping out at 3,000 nits (up from 2,700 nits). Aside from updated software and AI tools like Magic Cue and the Daily Hub, all of which will be available across the Pixel 10 family, the P10PF is getting two notable foldable-specific upgrades. The first is enhanced drag and drop support that works in tandem with expanded split screen functionality to improve multitasking and moving files between apps. That said, as I was using demo devices that were essentially fresh out of the box, it was difficult to tell how much of an impact this may have on everyday use. The other addition is a new dual-pane layout for the P10PF’s camera app, which takes better advantage of the extra screen space you have when the phone is unfolded. This allows you to see new photos as soon as you snap them on the left while the viewfinder stays open on the right. The biggest potential shortcoming of the P10PF is that its camera hardware is largely staying the same. Granted, that's not a huge deal because the previous model had the best photo quality of any foldable phone. But sadly, because the P10PF doesn't have the same sensors as the Pixel 10 Pro and Pro XL, this means the P10PF also won’t have access to Google’s AI-powered 100x Pro Res Zoom or the ability to capture portrait shots in full resolution. Unfortunately, when I asked if these features would be ported to the P10PF in the future, a Google rep told me there are currently no concrete plans to do so. Here's how last year's Pixel 9 Pro Fold (left) compares in size to the new Pixel 10 Pro Fold (right). Sam Rutherford for Engadget In a lot of ways, it feels like Google is doing almost everything it can to improve the Pixel 10 Pro Fold without completely redesigning it with a thinner chassis. So if you’re the type of person who can handle a little extra junk in the trunk, there’s a lot to like about a foldable phone that comes with more robust durability. The Pixel 10 Pro Fold starts at $1,799 and is available for pre-order today in two colors: jade and moonstone. However, there will be a bit of delay until it actually arrives as official sales aren’t slated to start until October 9.

    "summary": "Most people don’t think of Google when they think about smartwatch makers , but the latest Pixel Watch might change that. A surprising number of updates are coming to the Pixel Watch 4 , and I was impressed by how these changes add up to make it less of an iterative update than I initially expected. Of all its new features, I found the Pixel Watch 4’s satellite communications capability, repairable design and improved charging speeds most compelling. Other changes, like the brighter, curved display, dual-chip architecture, upgraded haptics engine and speaker as well as Wear OS 6 and other software features are less exciting, but will matter more to the day-to-day experience. The redesigned Fitbit app, which will have a new AI experience at its core, will also impact your daily use more. At first glance and from a recent hands-on, I’m intrigued by the Pixel Watch 4 and how the individual improvements might add up to a more meaningful overall experience. Satellite connectivity for emergency communications on a smartwatch I want to jump right into the new feature I’m most interested in: emergency satellite communications. Google says the Pixel Watch 4 is the first standalone commercial smartwatch to support this feature, and that probably largely has to do with the chip that powers it. The Snapdragon Wear 5 Gen 2, which Qualcomm announced today along with the Wear 5+ Gen 2, is the first wearable processor to offer satellite support, according to the company. It’ll use Skylo’s Narrowband Non-Terrestrial Network (NB-NTN) and allow for “two-way emergency messaging directly from the wearable device.” It’s worth noting that this will only work on LTE models and in the contiguous United States, though. In a recorded demo of the feature at a hands-on event, I saw what it would look like on a Pixel Watch 4 when you try to connect to a satellite to send a message. Now, to be extremely clear, this was a pre-recorded video that played on loop on the device. All I did was hit play and watch. Still, it was nice to get an idea of what the process would require. It looked like you’d need to follow onscreen instructions to move your wrist around while the system searched for an available satellite to connect to. It was reminiscent of existing versions on phones. Whether it’s ultimately reliable or effective is something I can’t say until I get to actually test it. Sam Rutherford for Engadget Improved charging dock and faster recharging In contrast, I did get to see for myself just how quickly the Pixel Watch 4 recharges. On paper, the company says the new watch can go from 0 to 50 percent charged in 15 minutes or less. I sat next to a Pixel Watch 4 for ten minutes as it sat on a charging dock, and saw it go from 70 percent to 90 percent in that time. That’s impressive, and though that math doesn’t appear to match what the company promised, there’s a fairly straightforward reason. A Google representative told me that past 80 percent, the charging changes from CC (constant current) to CV (constant voltage). Without getting too much into the technicalities of what’s happening , basically when CV kicks in, charging speeds slow down. This is a fairly standard battery optimization measure for most modern devices. If the Pixel Watch 4 were starting off closer to 0 percent, it’s possible that it would have recharged to 50 percent in 15 minutes, but I don’t know for certain. I’m also not sure whether the fact that the demo unit was connected to a portable battery instead of a wall socket made any difference in this case. I am, however, glad to see that it was able to get 20 percent of juice in just 10 minutes — just about the time it takes for me to get ready for the gym every morning. Google also redesigned the charging dock. Instead of a puck that sits under the watch (like you’ll find on almost all smartwatches today), the Pixel Watch 4 has a cradle that it can sit sideways in. The charger itself has a smaller footprint: instead of a round disc, it’s a rectangular dock about the size of a double A battery, with a groove in it to accommodate the watch. You can place the Pixel Watch 4 in there, knob side up with the screen facing either direction. When it’s connected, the watch will show the time and charge level and I could see that information from about six feet away. It’s basically the iPhone’s Standby mode but for a watch that’s propped up on its side. Sam Rutherford for Engadget I’m not sure how much easier it is to drop a watch sideways into a cradle as opposed to straight onto a disc, but I do think having the charge level be viewable from a distance is helpful. I’m also glad that Google spent time thinking about faster charging and making the device last longer, since those were complaints we had with previous models. To be specific, the company says the new smartwatch lasts 25 percent longer than its predecessor, thanks to a dual-chip architecture and efficiencies via Wear OS 6. New curved, brighter display Google says the Pixel Watch 4 has all new hardware on both the inside and out. In fact, it went as far as to say it completely redesigned the Pixel Watch and that this is the biggest update to the device yet. One of the most visible changes is the display. Not only is it 50 percent brighter than the one on the Pixel Watch 3, but the screen itself is domed this time, not just the glass at the top. I didn't really see a difference at first, but when looking a Pixel Watch 4 and 3 side-by-side, the new model was noticeably brighter, and watch faces seemed to stretch a bit closer to the edge of the case. Since the interface uses a black background, though, it was hard to tell whether the bezel was thinner. There are quite a few new features that I didn’t get to test, which I’ve collected in a list at the bottom of this article. For now, it’s probably more relevant to talk about things like Gemini on Wear OS 6, Raise to talk (to the assistant), the redesigned Fitbit app and the AI-powered updates. Raise to talk to Gemini and AI-generated message replies The Pixel Watch 4 isn’t the first watch to launch with Google’s latest wearable platform (that honor belongs to Samsung’s Galaxy Watch 8 series). But it does have an exclusive feature to make interacting with Gemini a bit easier: Raise to talk. Unlike on the Samsung wearable, where you have to verbally invoke the assistant or long press the knob on the side, on the Pixel Watch 4 you can bring your wrist to your face and Gemini will be ready for your requests. When it recognizes the gesture, the Pixel Watch 4 will show a small animated icon at the bottom of its screen to indicate it’s listening. But on my repeated attempts to trigger it, the system only registered that I had brought my wrist up about half of the time. Granted, I was using a watch that belonged to a Google representative and was a bit loose on my wrist, so the accuracy might improve with a better fit. I did notice other Google executives perform very deliberate movements to get the watch to listen and even then it seemed like Raise To Talk required multiple attempts to work. This is something I will have to wait till I get a unit in the real world to evaluate the efficacy of, but for now I am intrigued by the potential convenience but skeptical of the actual performance. Senior director of product management for Google Wearables Sandeep Waraich later explained that the system is currently tuned to recognize more deliberate movements as a way to avoid false positives. Waraich said that over time, and possibly by the time the Watch 4 is on shelves in October, the motion required to trigger Raise To Talk should require less exaggeration. When I did get Gemini to hear me, it responded fairly quickly to my question about activities to do in New York on a hot summer day. Again, I’d need more time with the device to judge how useful this would be in the real world. There was another feature that had much more potential to be helpful though: AI-generated quick replies to messages. I only saw a quick demo on a Google rep’s watch, but in response to a message saying “How’d the basketball game go?” the system suggested responses of “We won,” “We lost, but it was fun” and “It was great” with a basketball emoji. That’s much better than the canned prompts from before that were more likely to be “Yes,” “No,” “Call me later” or some other generic variant. It did take a second for them to load, though. A Google spokesperson at the event told us that this is possibly the first time an on-device language model has been deployed on a smartwatch, which might be noteworthy but it’s not anything that will materially impact the experience. I will say that while I didn’t get to dive too deeply into the rest of Wear OS 6 with Material 3 Expressive on the Pixel Watch 4, we do already have a review of the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 up and in it we cover some of the changes to the platform. On Google’s smartwatches, I liked how the new software made better use of space in things like the Weather and Search cards, with an improved balance between putting more information within one page while still retaining a generous size for buttons and text. Cherlynn Low for Engadget A closer look at the redesigned Fitbit app One of the places any Pixel Watch owner will be spending much of their time is the Fitbit app, where their collected health and fitness data will be presented. I spent some time with a preview version of the redesigned app, which will be available in October to Premium users in the US. Aesthetically, the app looks quite different, with a customizable dashboard of stats at the top of the main page (aka the Today tab). At the bottom are new tabs “Today,” “Fitness,” “Sleep” and “Health.” Though the font feels more reminiscent of recent Android and Material designs, existing Fitbit users will find the color scheme familiar. Purple is still what your sleep progress bar’s color is, while your steps are still shown in a teal bar. But below all those visual representations of data is a card with a prompt to chat with the new AI Coach, followed by what Google calls a “stream,” and a floating blue “Ask Coach” button at the bottom right. The stream is separated into Upcoming and “Your day so far” sections, with the latter populated by cards summarizing your progress on areas like sleep and fitness. In a small demo, Google's director of product management for Fitbit and Health Andy Abramson walked us through the new product. He showed us his app, where a card titled “Less sleep than usual last night” said he had about 4 hours and 28 minutes of estimated sleep. It summarized the amount of time awake and interruptions during that period, and then asked “Given the shorter duration, how are you feeling energetically this morning?” A card further down, titled “Your body is well-balanced today” and tagged “Readiness,” talked about Abramson’s readiness score, what it means and showed a chart on his performance this week. You can choose to continue conversations by tapping into each card, or simply ignore them and continue scrolling down the stream. Tapping through the tabs at the bottom brings you into similarly laid out pages with information specific to your activity, sleep and vitals (as measured by the wearable). That last one will show your heart rate, respiratory rate, blood oxygen and other stats, followed by sections called “Health areas,” “Detection and self screening” and “Personal info.” This presents a combination of information your fitness tracker collects, as well as data you enter. This all feeds into the new AI Coach, which will be a paid Fitbit Premium feature, that is meant to be your Gemini-powered “personal health coach.” It’s still a fairly new tool that’s going to be in limited preview as Google continues to assess its efficacy and evaluate necessary tweaks and guardrails, but at least it seems like the company is well aware of the potential pitfalls it might encounter in the development of any AI tool for health. In a press release announcing the new personal health coach and the Fitbit redesign, Google said “We’re committed to building our personal health coach with leading industry experts and through scientific research.” To that end, it’s partnering with Stephen Curry “and his performance team” and “also working closely with our Consumer Health Advisory Panel, a diverse group of leading experts in medicine, AI and behavioral science.” I remain skeptical of AI’s trustworthiness in general, but if there’s one thing Google and Fitbit have it’s an abundance of data from the years of experience they have in collecting health data from wearables. AI seems like a suitable method to make sense of the madness, as long as it’s done mindfully. And it does seem like the Pixel Watch and Fitbit teams are thinking carefully about their approach. I will need to wait till I get to use the new app and AI Coach on my own to see how personalized and useful it is, of course. Repairability plus a list of other updates coming to the Pixel Watch 4 There were quite a few other updates I didn’t get to test during my time with the Pixel Watch 4, including the AI-powered activity recognition system, improved sleep-tracking and overnight skin temperature-sensing, as well as the accuracy of the new dual-frequency GPS. I didn’t get to check out the feature that streams your bike workout stats to your phone in real time so you can see the details more easily when your device is mounted to your handlebar. I also didn’t go about measuring if the Watch 4’s vibrations were indeed 15 percent stronger than its predecessor’s, and I wasn’t able to verify if the speakers were clearer than before, either. In addition, I can’t vouch for the durability of the Pixel Watch 4, which is rated IP68 for dust- and water-resistance and has a custom Gorilla Glass covering and aluminum housing. I doubt I will be putting those ruggedness claims to the test, but it’s heartening to know there is a respectable level of protection here. Sam Rutherford for Engadget The good news is, even if you do manage to break the screen somehow, you won’t need to buy a new Pixel Watch 4. It has a repairable design that allows you to remove the display and battery in case those parts need to be replaced. Again, I didn’t break out my screwdriver and fix a Pixel Watch 4, but I did scrutinize the (very small) screws along the case in the groove where the straps attach to the device. Theoretically, though, I applaud the notion of repairable devices and am pleased to see Google take this approach. The Pixel Watch 4’s pricing, availability and value One more thing that’s laudable: The Pixel Watch 4’s price remains unchanged from the Pixel Watch 3. It starts at $349 for the 41mm Wi-Fi model, and you can get the larger size or LTE-connected variants for more money. The smartwatch is available for pre-order today, though it’ll only start shipping and be in stores on October 9. While I continue to recommend you wait till we can publish a full review before investing your hard-earned money on any device, I do think the list of improvements Google is bringing to the Pixel Watch series is a long, thoughtful and meaningful one. For a smartwatch that has faced its fair share of challenges across the generations, the Pixel Watch 4 finally feels like it’s both maturing and carving out a space for itself.

    "summary": "Amazon could finally be ditching its proprietary software on Fire tablets, according to a report by Reuters . The company is reportedly prepping a higher-end tablet that'll run on Android. This device could come next year and will reportedly cost around $400. Amazon's Fire tablet software is itself a heavily modified version of Android, but the upcoming tablet will reportedly use the actual OS. This is great news for those who want easy integration with other Android devices. It's also great news for app developers. The primary downside of Fire OS is that it mandates the use of its own app store. The custom nature of the OS requires developers to make separate versions of apps for Amazon tablets. This has severely limited the store's variety, especially when compared to the Google Play Store or the Apple App Store. The downside to all of this is likely the aforementioned $400 price tag. Fire tablets are known for being inexpensive. The Fire Tablet 7 costs $60 and sales can bring that down even further. The company's most expensive tablet is currently the Fire Max 11 , which costs $230. Amazon has declined to comment on the matter and we don't have any information regarding specs of the upcoming tablet. Hopefully the price increase translates to much better internals. This isn't the first time the company has given up on a product that used a proprietary operating system. The Fire Phone was released back in 2014 but failed to win over consumers. Amazon stopped selling the device in 2015 .

    "summary": "Sony held out longer than Microsoft and Nintendo , but it too is increasing the prices of PlayStation consoles in the US starting on August 21. The standard PS5 (the one with with a disc drive) will now run you $550, up from $500. The Digital Edition is $500, up from $450. The PS5 Pro , meanwhile, will require you to fork over a whopping $750. That’s up from an already-eyewatering $700. In other words, each console got a $50 price bump. Sony says it’s rolling out the price increases due to (you guessed it) market uncertainty. \"Similar to many global businesses, we continue to navigate a challenging economic environment,\" it said in a blog post . \"As a result, we’ve made the difficult decision to increase the recommended retail price for PlayStation 5 consoles in the US starting on August 21.\" The silver lining to this is that Sony isn't increasing the prices of accessories for the time being. \"We have no other price changes to announce for additional markets,\" the company added. The company bumped up PS5 prices in the UK, Europe and Australia in April. It increased PS Plus prices in several markets that same month. So, it seemed the US was unlikely to be spared price hikes for much longer. Normally by this point in a console’s lifecycle, we would have seen a price cut. But nope, nearly five years into this generation and those who haven’t snapped up a PS5 or Xbox Series X/S now face the prospect of having to shell out more money for the consoles. The same goes for the Nintendo Switch, but at this point you'd likely be better off with a Switch 2, which costs just $60 more.

    "summary": "8BitDo is predominantly known for its excellent gamepads of all shapes and sizes , but it makes other accessories too, including a charging dock for the Xbox Wireless Controller that is currently 20 percent off. Right now you can grab the officially licensed dock for $20, down from its regular price of $25. 8BitDo’s charging dock is compatible with the Xbox Series X|S and Xbox One variants of the Xbox Wireless Controller and uses magnetic contact charging to juice up your pad. It comes with a 1,100mAh battery pack and a battery door for each version of Microsoft's controller. Note that you get a USB-C cable included, but not a power adapter. Charging time is around three hours, and a light indicator tells you the status of your pad’s battery: It’s amber while charging, and white when the controller is fully charged. The Xbox Wireless Controller is one of the few modern pads that still ships with AA batteries out of the box. While they tend to last for a while, you’ll likely want to upgrade to a rechargeable alternative eventually, and 8BitDo’s currently discounted accessory ensures you’ll never have a flat controller again.

    "summary": "Google has announced a multi-year partnership with Steph Curry at its Made by Google event, and as part of that team-up, it says the NBA superstar will use AI from Google Cloud to improve his performance on the court. Yep, the company is claiming that Google Cloud AI can help the four-time NBA champ, two-time MVP and two-time scoring champion get even better at basketball. According to the company, AI insights can analyze his shot quality as well as sharpen his workout plans. Google's AI Basketball Coach experience, its AI experiment that turns Gemini into a jump shot coach with help from Pixel cameras, will also analyze his form and give him visual feedback. The basketball icon already tried out AI Basketball Coach during Curry Camp, his three-day basketball camp where he mentors 30 student athletes from across the US. \"Through interactive demos and challenges, the next generation of athletes learned how our technology can help them elevate their game,\" Google said. Curry's partnership with Google goes beyond using AI to make him even better at his sport, though. Google is officially calling him a \"Performance Advisor,\" and he and his team will actively work with the company's health experts and product and AI engineers to help shape the future of Google Health and upcoming Fitbit models. The athlete's team will be testing Google's personal health coach and giving the company feedback on how to improve its ability to create tailored advice for each individual. They will be using Pixel phones, watches and buds, as well. Their input, Google said, will be used to \"fine-tune products, train algorithms and design future product experiences.\" This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-says-steph-curry-will-use-its-ai-to-get-better-at-basketball-141532440.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "The COSORI 9-in-1 air fryer is on sale for $90, cutting 25 percent off the retail price. Whether you've stumbled upon air fryers for health reasons , convenience or you're already a card-carrying member of the air fryer clan, a sale is a great time to pick one up. We selected the COSORI as the runner-up for best air fryer overall , and were impressed with its six-quart capacity despite its relatively small footprint on the kitchen counter. Our reviewers found the basket was super roomy enough to fit quite a few chicken wings and a whole block of tofu without too much crowding. With nine different preset cooking modes to work with, the COSORI is a true workhorse. It has a preheat mode for starting a cook at a precise temperature, a proof option for home bakers, a dedicated frozen setting and more, including standard broil, bake and roast modes. The COSORI has some creature comforts that we really appreciated too, like an easy-to-use touchscreen, a basket release button and an auto-pause feature that turns off the cooking element when you release the basket. The air fryer craze doesn’t look to die down any time soon, and if you haven’t jumped on the bandwagon, now might be the right time to do so.

    "summary": "Xbox gamers will have a new option for taking their library on the go this fall. During Gamescom 2025, ASUS revealed that the Xbox Ally handheld consoles will be on store shelves on October 16. We heard a thorough explanation of the specs and availability for the ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X this summer, but the arrival date is the only new info to come from the major gaming event in Cologne. There's still no price available for these handhelds, but we expect to receive that critical detail along with pre-order information some time in the coming weeks. For comparison, the 2024 ROG Ally X costs $800 while the simpler ROG Ally Gaming Console from 2023 costs $500. So if we were hazarding guesses, the ROG Xbox Ally might come in at a price tag around $650, while the spiffier ROG Xbox Ally X could be more in the ballpark of $900. The Official Xbox Podcast also included a segment about the upcoming handhelds, with a pair of Xbox execs talking about the devices and their experiences using them for titles like Tony Hawk's Pro Skater , Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 and Balatro . The chatter is unsurprisingly very positive about the hardware, but it might have enough tidbits to hold you over if you're super amped about getting your own hands on an Xbox Ally this fall.

    "summary": "Last year, the most powerful geomagnetic storm in 20 years hit Earth . It produced stunning aurora displays in parts of the US that are normally too far south to see them. Normally, such storms are a headache for energy providers. In 1989, for example, the Canadian province of Québec suffered a nine-hour blackout following a series of plasma ejections from the Sun. This time around, power companies were better prepared, and in the US and Canada, there weren't significant service disruptions. The episode highlighted the value of proper preparation against geomagnetic storms, and for the past couple of years, NASA and IBM have been working to give the scientific community and others a better way to predict solar weather. Today, they're releasing the result of their work, an open-source foundation model called Surya. Named after the Sanskrit word for the Sun, Juan Bernabe-Moreno, director of IBM Research Europe, UK and Ireland, describes the system as an \"AI telescope for the Sun.\" IBM trained the model on nine years of high-resolution images from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), a satellite NASA has been using to study the Sun since 2010. IBM Effectively, Surya applies machine learning to solar image interpretation and forecasting, and the results are promising. In early testing, Bernabe-Moreno says IBM found the model was 16 percent more accurate at answering the question \"will there be a solar flare in the next 24 hours?\" than past systems. Additionally, the model can generate visual predictions of what the SDO might see ahead of time. So far, using data from the most recently completed solar cycle , IBM has found Surya can accurately predict what the sun will look like two hours ahead of time. \"We’re exploring the accuracy of even longer lead time predictions,\" Bernabe-Moreno told me. Two hours might not seem like a lot, but according to Bernabe-Moreno, who previously worked at one of Europe's largest energy companies, it could be a game changer for infrastructure providers, which have spent the last few decades building more responsive power grids. Moreover, Surya is a 366 million parameter model, meaning it's light enough to run on less powerful hardware. The irony of today's announcement is that it demonstrates the value of NASA's science team exactly at a time when its very existence is threatened. If you haven't been following what's been going on at the agency, President Trump plans to cut NASA's science budget by nearly half . The Solar Dynamics Observatory would be among the missions affected by the proposed cuts. It won't be cancelled like New Horizons and OSIRIS-APEX, but according to an analysis by The Planetary Society , the mission would have its operating budget slashed from $14 million annually to $8 million per year. IBM Policymakers from both parties have pushed back on the proposal, but with the Senate and House not yet in agreement on the agency's 2026 operating budget, and the appropriations deadline quickly approaching, NASA's fate is uncertain. Even if the cuts don't go through, the agency is on track to lose close to 4,000 employees , or about 20 percent of its workforce, as part of the Trump administration's broader efforts to trim the number of workers across the federal government. Bernabe-Moreno says Surya wouldn't have come together without NASA's help. \"From the very beginning, the science team at NASA have been informing us what the model should do, how to validate the model, and how to ensure it's robust,\" he said. If there's a silver lining to the funding situation, it's that the science team's work will live on. \"The beauty of this model is that we created a capability — an AI platform, if you want,\" said Bernabe-Moreno. \"And this capability has applications beyond NASA.\" If you want to check out Surya for yourself, you can download the model from Hugging Face .

    "summary": "Whether you need a new MacBook for the upcoming semester or you've just been itching to upgrade from an older machine, now's a good time to buy. Amazon has a sale on the latest M4 MacBook Air that knocks up to 20 percent off many configurations. The base model is where you'll get the biggest discount. The 16GB RAM/256GB SSD laptop is down to $799 from $999, which is the lowest price we've seen. You can upgrade to 512GB SSD for $999 , down from $1,199, another all-time low price, or 24GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD for $1,199, down from $1,399. Then there's the 15-inch MacBook Air M4 , whose cheapest model is on sale for $999, dropping from $1,199. The 17 percent discount is the best deal we've seen since the pair debuted in March. As with the 13-inch model, the 16GB and 512GB SSD option is also a record-low price, dropping to $1,199 from $1,399. Then there's the 24GB upgrade , which is $1,399, down from $1,599. We're big fans of the MacBook Air M4, giving it a 92 in our review . Part of that comes from an already lower starting price for the MacBooks than their predecessors. The 2025 models also get a speed boost thanks to the M4 chip and are very thin with a 0.44-inch thickness. Neither the 13- or 15-inch will drag you down, weighing 2.7 pounds and 3.2 pounds, respectively. Plus, they both have excellent battery life, lasting over 18 hours while playing an HD video. The big differences in the 15-inch model mostly come down to size. The screen is obviously bigger, as is its trackpad. Other than that, it offers better speakers than its 13-inch sibling.

Roughly two decades (and console eras) later, Capcom has returned to the series , even getting the definitive samurai actor, Tom Cruise Mifune Toshiro, to play the hero, the legendary swordsman Miyamoto Musashi. At Gamescom, the company is now demoing an early slice of Way of the Sword, which covers most (but not all) of the game shown at SGF 2025 just a few months ago. It’s an interesting time to return to the samurai-meets-demonic-threat universe of Onimusha, following a sudden boom in games tapping into feudal Japan. Most recently, the latest Assassin’s Creed was set there, while, Sony’s upcoming Ghost of Yotei (not to mention its predecessor) both tap bushido and swordplay in historical Japan. While I played through the demo, I made a lot of mental comparisons to Sekiro – a game that’s now several years old and still unbeaten by me. Onimusha draws together similar themes of demon forces run amok, but has a more forgiving approach. Gameplay centers around blocks and parries, plus weak and strong attacks, all while pulling in orbs dropped by dying enemies that act as the game’s currency. (Health orbs are also dropped by certain foes.) Capcom The Oni gauntlet that absorbs these souls can also be used to see invisible demons and unlock areas that are spiritually blocked. It’ll also act like a sort-of demonic movie projector, showing what happened during the demon invasion in the area. Early enemies were predictably sluggish demon swordsmen and archers, getting me back up to speed with how Onimusha fights play out. Even if it predictably looks lightyears ahead of its predecessors, Way of the Sword doesn’t reinvent how you cut up these demon hordes. In comparison to other action games, guarding seems very forgiving. You can hold the guard button down, and it’ll block basic projectiles and melee attacks from all directions I spent some time leaning into exhausting stamina gauges, timing parries for one-hit Issen critical attack and batting away arrows back where they came from. Don’t get me wrong, it’s satisfying and fun, but I’m itching to see how the series will build on what’s pretty basic attack flow. Musashi had acccess to a dual-short sword special attack, Two Celestials, that barrages the enemy with attacks and tops up his health levels. This suggests more special attacks and magical flourishes should open up later in the game. The preview during SGF 2025 also showed ways to utilize the environment for defensive attacks, holding up wooden boards to block arrows, for instance, although that didn’t trigger during my playthrough. Capcom The highlight of the demo was a confrontation with Musashi’s rival, Ganryu Sasaki. He’s great villain fodder — and has also been somehow gifted his own Oni gauntlet. The duel was the only time I felt under threat during the demo, and even then, I didn’t die once. There’s enough of a health meter to test yourself against Sasaki’s lavish sword attacks and lunges. Once you wear down more powerful enemies, you can make a single, concentrated attack to either glean more orbs from them or hit for heavy-duty damage. The early taste of Way of the Sword is a fun, easy romp, so I’m curious to see how Capcom evolves the formula of Onimusha — and where the true challenges might lie. Onimusha: Way of the Sword is set to be released in 2026 on PS5, Xbox Series S|X, and PC.

Settlement development in E1, an open tract of land east of Jerusalem, has been under consideration for more than two decades, but was frozen due to U.S. pressure during previous administrations. The international community overwhelmingly considers Israeli settlement construction in the West Bank to be illegal and an obstacle to peace. Prime minister Anthony Albanese said on Wednesday that he treats leaders of other countries with respect after his Israeli counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu attacked him over his decision to recognise a Palestinian state. “I don’t take these things personally, I engage with people diplomatically. He has had similar things to say about other leaders,” Albanese said during a media briefing. A 58% majority of Americans believe that every country in the United Nations should recognise Palestine as a nation, according to a new Reuters/Ipsos poll, as Israel and Hamas considered a possible truce in the nearly two-year-long war. 33% of respondents did not agree that UN members should recognise a Palestinian state and 9% did not answer. German prosecutors have charged a Russian national they suspect of planning an attack on the Israeli embassy in Berlin and of trying to join militant organisation Islamic State, they said on Wednesday. Prosecutors believe the accused, identified only as Akhmad E. in line with German privacy rules, obtained instructions from the Internet on how to make explosives but the plan failed as he could not get the components he needed.

You’ll also find models with handy extras like built-in speakers, touchscreen support and wide compatibility with Windows laptops and tablets. Whether you’re after a laptop screen extender or a creative companion for photo editing on the go, there’s a portable monitor out there for you. Table of contents Best portable monitors for 2025 Things to consider before buying a portable monitor What to look for in a portable monitor Portable monitor FAQs Best portable monitors for 2025 Things to consider before buying a portable monitor Before you start looking at specific products, it’s super important to think about how and where you plan on using a second monitor as a portable display. Larger panels are great for home use where you may only need to move it or put it away when you have company over. Meanwhile, smaller screens are great for travel and whipping out at a coffee shop or shared workspace. But if you go too small, you may be adding extra weight to your bag without providing a ton of extra utility, especially if it lacks a good USB-C cable or mini HDMI for connectivity. Screen size and compatibility with your existing devices should be top considerations. It’s also important to consider your typical workload, as artists may get extra value out of monitors with higher maximum brightness, HDR, wider color accuracy and a higher contrast ratio. Those who spend all day looking at spreadsheets won’t get as much value from more vibrant displays or FHD displays with high refresh rates, but they may still benefit from having a basic plug-and-play second monitor for multitasking. What to look for in a portable monitor Aside from price and screen size, some of the most important specs in a portable monitor include panel type, pixels per inch, brightness, refresh rate and connectivity. Most portable monitors use IPS LCD displays, which generally offer good viewing angles, strong brightness and good power efficiency. However, some higher resolution models now feature OLED screens that support wider color gamuts, better color accuracy and contrast ratio, which can be a major benefit for artists and content creators. Some budget models may use TN panels, as that can help cut costs and reduce energy consumption. That said, we generally try to stay away from those as they often have worse image quality compared to IPS screens. For brightness, 300 nits is the lowest we recommend — anything less can make the monitor hard to use even in some indoor environments. Ideally, we look for screens that are closer to 350 or 400 nits and above for better accuracy and visibility. Connectivity is also important because if you can’t easily hook your phone, gaming console, or laptop to a monitor, it becomes an oversized paperweight. Most travel displays include an HDMI port or USB-C port(or both), which cover the large majority of devices. It’s rare to find a portable monitor these days with only USB-A, since the majority of devices have moved over to USB-C. However, we also like models that support passthrough power over USB-C connections, which reduces the complexity of your setup and decreases the number of cords and adapters you have to carry around. Finally, most portable monitors feature 60Hz refresh rates, which is fine for most use cases. However, if you’re looking for a gaming monitor, there are models with 120Hz or even 240Hz refresh rates. These are excellent choices for gamers looking to maintain smooth fps while playing on the go. Portable monitor FAQs What are the disadvantages of a portable monitor? The main disadvantage of a portable monitor in comparison to a regular monitor is size. Most portable monitors sit in the 14- to 17-inch range to allow them to be as portable as their name suggests. While you can find some portable monitors sized at 20 inches or larger, they become less and less convenient to take on the go the larger they get. What is the difference between a tablet and a portable monitor? A tablet is essentially a portable computer that can run apps, games and more without a supporting device. Portable monitors are indeed supportive devices designed to expand your screen real estate; in order for them to have any use, they must be connected to a laptop or tablet. What ports should I look for in a portable monitor? The most important port to look for on a portable monitor is the one with which you'll connect the monitor to your computer. Most portable monitors will have either an HDMI or USB-C port to do this. After that, it's handy for a portable monitor to have other connectors such as a USB-A port, extra USB-C ports and others for you to hook up additional accessories.

    "summary": "We may deliberate for days when buying a laptop or computer or spend hours lining up the most comfortable and stylish keyboard before aimlessly adding a utilitarian mouse to our basket. The impact of a good, feature-rich and — perhaps most importantly — ergonomic mouse can be huge. Not just to your productivity, but to the quality and comfort of your worklife overall. A good mouse has long offered some level of configuration and customization, but more modern options go beyond that with the ability to automate repetitive tasks or convoluted keypresses at the click of a button. Unsurprisingly, even mice haven’t escaped the wave of AI hype, with many flagship models bringing services like ChatGPT or Copilot to your fingertips. Beyond the fancy features, there’s still a lot to consider to find the best mouse for work, creativity or even play. Will the mouse fit your grip style or handedness? Do you prefer the convenience of Bluetooth or stability of a 2.4Ghz USB dongle? Can it connect to more than one device easily? Is the smoothness of the scroll wheel going to be a dealbreaker? Perhaps the companion software unlocks new functionality you never knew you needed? If you hadn’t considered all of those things, the good news is, we have (and more). Below are our picks for the best wireless productivity mice you can buy right now.

    "summary": "The White House has joined TikTok, the social media app that President Trump wanted to ban during his first term. Its first post shows clips of Trump in various events with Kendrick Lamar's track playing in the background. The New York Times notes that it references a popular video edit of Creed, a boxing movie starring Michael B. Jordan, on the app. In the TikTok post, Trump could be heard saying \"I am your voice,\" while the caption reads \"America we are BACK! What's up TikTok?\" Trump's administration believes TikTok helped him win over young voters in the 2024 Presidential election, with the account he used to campaign having over 15 million followers. \"President Trump's message dominated TikTok during his presidential campaign, and we're excited to build upon those successes and communicate in a way no other administration has before,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement . The president wasn't always fond of the platform. He once vowed to ban the app in the US and signed an executive order to outlaw any transaction between the app and its China-based parent company ByteDance for national security reasons. TikTok's \"data collection threatens to allow the Chinese Communist Party access to Americans' personal and proprietary information — potentially allowing China to track the locations of Federal employees and contractors, build dossiers of personal information for blackmail, and conduct corporate espionage,\" the executive order read . After taking office earlier this year, however, Trump quickly put a pause on the law that was supposed to ban TikTok in the US. He even delayed the ban a couple more times to give ByteDance more time to sell its US business. Trump previously claimed that a \"very wealthy\" group is poised to buy TikTok, but the administration has yet to reveal the identities of the people in it.

    "summary": "The wait for accessing iOS 26 and iPadOS 26 is getting shorter as the Apple iPhone event inches closer. The OS 26es are bringing huge upgrades to your iPhone and iPad's operating systems. One you've probably heard us talk about numerous times is the visual update: Liquid Glass . (It's like the better-executed version of Windows Vista .) We spent two weeks test-driving it — you can check out our detailed hands-on iOS 26 preview , or you can try it out yourself by downloading and installing the public beta 2 . That software is a more stable iteration of the separate developer version, which recently hit the beta 7 waypoint, and offers a few more flashy features not yet available in the public version. (While the public beta is open to everyone and quite stable, always remember there's a degree of risk involved with beta software.) Additionally, there are credible reports that iOS 26 could bring a new live translation feature to AirPods , too. Not sure if you want to upgrade your smartphone or tablet this year? No worries, we'll help you find out if your devices will be able to run iOS 26. While Apple didn't nix any iPhones from its eligibility list last year, that's not the case for 2025 — a few models are getting cut this time. All iPhone 8 models and the iPhone X were the last to get the boot in 2023, and this year the 2018 models are getting left behind. If you have an ineligible device, you won't be able to download iOS 26 when it becomes available this fall. We'll get to the bottom of which iPhones and iPads will support iOS 26 and iPadOS 26 this year. To see what's coming with the latest OSes, check out everything announced at Apple's WWDC June 9 event . One thing you shouldn't immediately expect is Apple's updated version of Siri , though the company is reportedly working on a 'stripped-down' AI chatbot to compete with ChatGPT. These three iPhones won't be compatible with iOS 26 Unlike last year, several iPhone models won't be eligible to download the newest iOS when it makes its debut this fall. This trio of models first released in 2018 won't be coming to the iOS 26 party: iPhone XR iPhone XS iPhone XS Max iPhones compatible with iOS 26 While we don't yet know the new iPhones Apple will be dropping this fall — though there are iPhone 17 rumors — we do know, per Apple's site , that the phones listed below will be compatible with iOS 26. Basically, if you have an iPhone that was announced in 2019 or later, you're in the clear: iPhone SE (second generation or later) iPhone 11 iPhone 11 Pro iPhone 11 Pro Max iPhone 12 iPhone 12 mini iPhone 12 Pro iPhone 12 Pro Max iPhone 13 iPhone 13 mini iPhone 13 Pro iPhone 13 Pro Max iPhone 14 iPhone 14 Plus iPhone 14 Pro iPhone 14 Pro Max iPhone 15 iPhone 15 Plus iPhone 15 Pro iPhone 15 Pro Max iPhone 16 iPhone 16 Plus iPhone 16 Pro iPhone 16 Pro Max iPhone 16e iPads compatible with iPadOS 26 The iPads listed below, and any iPads released later this year, are eligible to download iPadOS 26 . iPad Pro (M4) iPad Pro 12.9‑inch (3rd generation and later) iPad Pro 11‑inch (1st generation and later) iPad Air (3rd generation and later, including M2 and M3) iPad (8th generation and later, including A16) iPad mini (5th generation and later, including A17 Pro) What if I don't want to buy a new iPhone? If you want to continue using your older iPhone that isn't supported by iOS 26, that's fine. However, you'll miss out on security updates which could potentially put your phone at risk for malware and other threats. Additionally, some apps may stop working if they require a certain version of iOS or later. And of course, you won't be able to access the latest features iOS 26 offers. When will iOS 26 become available? Apple usually rolls out its latest iOS in mid-September, just a few days before the new iPhones hit store shelves. Last year, it released iOS 18 on Monday, Sept. 16. Expect a confirmation of the release date at the iPhone 17 event, expected in early September. iOS 26 features we're excited about Liquid Glass design : Your home screen is getting revamped with new app icons, including dark mode and all-clear options. You'll also notice buttons with a new floating design. Liquid Glass was designed to make all of Apple's OSes more cohesive. Phone app redesign: You'll finally be able to scroll through contacts, recent calls and voicemail messages all on one screen. It also comes with a new feature called Hold Assist that'll notify you when an agent comes to the phone so you can avoid the elevator music. Live Translate: iOS 26 is bringing the ability to have a conversation via phone call or text message with someone who speaks another language. Live Translate will translate your conversation in real time. Polls feature: Coming to group messages in the Messages app, chat members will be able to create polls. This can help prevent the unwanted 30+ messages when it comes to deciding which restaurant you're meeting at this weekend.

    "summary": "Yes, September is all about iPhone, but Google is taking center stage today with its hotly anticipated Pixel hardware event. Thanks to a parade of leaks, we think we know mostly what to expect today — Pixel 10 phones, along with new watches and earbuds — but we'll know for sure later today. That's because the event kicks off at 1PM ET. If you want to be the first to hear the official scoop, you can tune into the Made by Google YouTube channel (or right here!) to catch Google's event, which will be hosted by Jimmy Fallon and also include other celebrities like Stephen Curry , Lando Norris and the Jonas Brothers — get ready for some potentially awkward cue card readings! And open a second window to follow our Pixel event liveblog for real-time analysis. Sam Rutherford for Engadget What's on tap? You can expect a more power-efficient Tensor G5 processor in all the new Pixel 10 phones. (That could help power new Gemini AI features , too.) The base-level Pixel 10 should get a big camera upgrade: a 5x telephoto lens. Before this generation, you had to splurge on a Pro or Fold model to get optical zoom.

The developer teased a follow-up project as the closer to Gamescom's Opening Night Live showcase with a brief but beautifully detailed glimpse at Black Myth: Zhong Kui . There's no date attached to the cinematic teaser, and that's because the game is still very much a work in progress. According to the FAQ entry about a possible release window, the team says \"Well, to be honest—even Yocar himself has absolutely no idea\" when it'll be ready. But the same page does confirm that the plan is for Zhong Kui to launch on both PC and \"all mainstream console platforms\" whenever it is done. From the title and the previous Black Myth game, this new project will once again be drawing inspiration from Chinese mythology. Legends around Zhong Kui dub him a conqueror of ghosts and evil spirits, so perhaps there will be some supernatural vibes in this entry to the emerging game series. Pretty much the only other thing we know besides the name and character is that Black Myth: Zhong Kui will once again be a single-player ARPG and it will be \"following the same business model as before.\" This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/black-myth-zhong-kui-next-221537956.html?src=rss",

At the Opening Night Live of Gamescom 2025, the roguelike unveiled its next update, titled Woolhaven . The paid DLC will arrive early next year, but no price has been set yet. Woolhaven introduces a dangerous new mountain zone to the game, where you'll find two new dungeons to conquer and as well as a spreading corruption called Rot. And you'd expect from the main story, your choices about how to deal with the mountain's denizens have no right or easy answers. Things will also get frosty for your settlement with the addition of blizzards and freezing temperatures that create new reasons for followers to doubt your all-knowing guidance. But you can also keep them happy with the new ranching system for raising rare animals that can provide your cult with wool, food and a pretty sweet ride.

The developer teased a follow-up project as the closer to Gamescom's Opening Night Live showcase with a brief but beautifully detailed glimpse at Black Myth: Zhong Kui . There's no date attached to the cinematic teaser, and that's because the game is still very much a work in progress. According to the FAQ entry about a possible release window, the team says \"Well, to be honest—even Yocar himself has absolutely no idea\" when it'll be ready. But the same page does confirm that the plan is for Zhong Kui to launch on both PC and \"all mainstream console platforms\" whenever it is done. From the title and the previous Black Myth game, this new project will once again be drawing inspiration from Chinese mythology. Legends around Zhong Kui dub him a conqueror of ghosts and evil spirits, so perhaps there will be some supernatural vibes in this entry to the emerging game series. Pretty much the only other thing we know besides the name and character is that Black Myth: Zhong Kui will once again be a single-player ARPG and it will be \"following the same business model as before.\" This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/black-myth-zhong-kui-is-the-next-title-from-game-science-studio-221537808.html?src=rss",

The second season had already been loosely pegged for a December release when the news of a third season appeared earlier this year, and the studio shared a few still images of the cast in the upcoming New Vegas setting just yesterday. The announcement during the Opening Night Live show for Gamescom 2025 also included a surprisingly lengthy teaser trailer with a few tidbits about what to expect in the next eight episodes of the hugely popular video game adaptation. It includes footage of the show's first Deathclaw, that well-known and oft-despised enemy from the world of the games. Alongside returning stars Ella Purnell, Aaron Moten and Walton Goggins, the teaser reveals that Justin Theroux has been cast as Mr. House, the enigmatic leader of New Vegas.
