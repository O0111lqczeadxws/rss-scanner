The publication reported that Oracle has promised to develop tens of billions of dollars in data centers, which have become a hot business. Notably, Oracle landed a deal to back operations at OpenAI, in a partnership that will give the AI company 4.5 gigawatts of computing power . According to Bloomberg , that's enough energy to power \"millions of American homes.\" So far, Oracle has seemed willing to throw money at its AI data center projects, no matter how expensive or irresponsible the needs might be. For instance, a source said the company plans to spend more than $1 billion a year powering a single data center in Texas with gas generators rather than waiting for a utility connection to be built. When completed, this data center is expected to be one of the largest known sites, with computing power of 1.4 gigawatts. In addition to the huge monetary cost, such a project can also have negative human and environmental impact. The Elon Musk-owned xAI is under fire after a supercomputer for its artificial intelligence operations became a primary source of air pollution in Memphis thanks to methane-powered turbines. Other majors, including Google , Microsoft and Meta , have chosen to try nuclear power for their data center projects, which comes with its own potential complications and risks. Purely on the financial side, Oracle's decision to invest so much so quickly meant the company reported its first negative annual cash flow since 1990. Should the current rates of AI investment turn out to be a bubble, it could be very bad news to have many billions of dollars on the line.

The company announced its third delay to the Analogue 3D on Wednesday, pushing the retro system back to Q4 2025. However, it said that's an intentionally conservative estimate, so this probably isn't a huge concern. The postponement follows previous ones in March and July. (The last time was due to tariffs .) Analogue acknowledged the frustration pre-order customers must be feeling. \"We know this sucks,\" the Pocket maker wrote. \"Another delay, announced late, after months of patience. We feel it too.\" The Analogue 3D uses an FPGA (field programmable gate array) chip to emulate N64 hardware. The company promises it will work with every official N64 cartridge ever released without any slowdowns or inaccuracies. Analogue So, why bother with the $250 console when you can grab a used Nintendo 64 for under $100? Well, Analogue's take supports 4K output, variable refresh rate displays and both PAL and NTSC carts. It's also adding \"original display mode\" filters to simulate old-school TVs. (They're similar to those you find on the company's highly rated Analogue Pocket handheld console .) Analogue says the system is 99 percent done — including hardware, system and packaging. \"The last 1% is where we're focused,\" the company wrote. It says it wants every detail to meet its high standards. Nonetheless, pre-orderers who wish to bail can do so by contacting support. Frustrations aside, delays are indeed better than shipping incomplete products — even if only by one percent. \"We're pushing without pause and appreciate everyone's patience and trust,\" the company wrote in an email to customers. \"Analogue will always deliver — delays or not, it's a commitment to our standard of care.\" This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/analogue-delays-its-n64-remake-console-yet-again-205343467.html?src=rss", "ingested_utc": "2025-08-20T21:33:37Z"}
