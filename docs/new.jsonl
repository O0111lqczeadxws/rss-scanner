Bolton served as Trump’s third national security advis er in his first term in office, but has since become a vocal critic of the president . Less than an hour ago, a post from Bolton’s X account critiqued the state of negotiations between Russia and Ukraine. “Russia has not changed its goal: drag Ukraine into a new Russian Empire,” he wrote. “Meanwhile, meetings will continue because Trump wants a Nobel Peace Prize, but I don’t see these talks making any progress.” Continue reading...", "ingested_utc": "2025-08-22T17:34:19Z"}

The company describes The Division 2: Survivors as \"an updated take on the survival extraction experience.\" Is it DLC? Is it a new game mode? We have no idea. But Ubisoft said it will \"strive for transparency during its development.\" Unfortunately, that didn't apply to its announcement. Ubisoft said Survivors is in its early stages, which may explain the lack of detail. Other media outlets have reported that it will come in 2026. But the company's franchise roadmap places its release date under \"TBA.\" \" The Division 2: Survivors is as much your baby as it is ours, and we strive for transparency during its development,\" Executive Producer Julian Gerighty wrote in the announcement blog post. \"Clear communication and community involvement are a focus as we build the new experience, and we will be closely involving you as we move forward on the development journey.\" Ubisoft Ubisoft also confirmed that its free-to-play mobile game is still in the pipeline. The Division Resurgence is expected this year. The company announced a delay last summer. A Redditor who played a beta version in 2023 described it in less than appealing terms. \"Overall, Resurgence is a console clone of The Division , where you can team up and play with clunky, small mobile controls.\" To be fair, much could have changed in its development since then. Regardless, you can sign up for the closed beta on Ubisoft's website .
