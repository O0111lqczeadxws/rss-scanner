The deal applies to all five colorways, and there are some snazzy options to choose from. This particular model didn't make our list of the best power banks , but plenty of other Anker products did. The 621 MagGo is equipped with magnets that attach to the back of certain iPhone models, which makes it easy to charge up the handset while still using it. The 5,000 mAh device can juice up the latest flagship iPhone 16 Pro Max to around 60 percent when fully charged. This is a thin and light device, so it's perfect for pockets, purses, backpacks and just about anywhere else. It charges up via an included USB-C cable. As a warning, the Anker 621 MagGo requires a magnetic connection via the smartphone itself or a magnetic case. It won't work with non-magnetic cases. It also runs a bit hot, reaching internal temperatures of up to 118 F, which could be something to keep an eye on during use. Follow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice .

Local authorities have granted the company the permit needed to be able to test autonomous vehicles in parts of Manhattan and Downtown Brooklyn. It's the first-ever permit for the \"testing deployment\" of AVs the city has granted. Waymo will be able to deploy a fleet with up to eight vehicles in the city until late September 2025. For now, though, the permit only allows Waymo to test its AVs with drivers behind the wheel. The company announced earlier this year that it was going to test its driverless system in 10 new cities in 2025. In June, it filed a request for permission to test its AVs in New York City in hopes that it can someday bring its autonomous ride-hailing service to the Big Apple. To note, while Adams said the city granted Waymo the first permit of its kind, the company deployed its vehicles to map some parts of NYC back in 2021 . Under the permit, Waymo will be required to regularly report the data gathered from its testing to the Department of Transportation to certify that it's \"adhering to the industry’s best practices related to cybersecurity.\" Waymo will be given the opportunity to apply for an extension after its pilot testing period ends in September. It may have to continue testing them with human operators for a while, though: New York state law prohibits the operation of vehicles without a driver behind the wheel, but Waymo told Forbes that it's lobbying to change the regulation.
