This line of headphones is consistently impressive and the WH-1000XM is truly in a league of its own . So we get excited when one of the all-around best headphones out there goes on an aggressive sale. You can pick up a pair of XM5s right now for just $274, which is 32 percent off its normal retail price of $400. In our review of the XM5 we awarded a score of 95 out of 100, impressed with just about every aspect of the set with the notable exception of its price, which makes a sale like this all the more exciting. The XM5s are supremely comfortable, thanks to a slim cushioned headband and soft earcups. In our review, we had no problem wearing them for hours at a time and never felt uncomfortable pressure on the ears or head. 30mm carbon-fiber drivers deliver excellent audio, delivering a wide and immersive soundstage. The XM5 carries eight total microphones as part of its active noise-canceling system, up from four on the previous model , and delivers top-of-class ANC. The battery life on these headphones is best in class, with around 30 hours of listening per charge. Touch controls on the outside panel of the right ear cup help you control your music with ease, allowing you to play, pause, skip tracks and adjust the volume right from the headphones. The only real downside at this point is you’re buying a pair of headphones that are three years old; the XM6 offers some noteworthy improvements. But, of course, it’ll cost you. If you've been thinking about upgrading your headphones, or picking up your first pair of real high-quality cans, then take advantage of these savings. The sale price of $274 applies to the black model only, though the other colors are 18 percent off, selling for $328. Follow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice .
