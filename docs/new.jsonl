It comes with a 1,100mAh battery pack and a battery door for each version of Microsoft's controller. Note that you get a USB-C cable included, but not a power adapter. Charging time is around three hours, and a light indicator tells you the status of your pad’s battery: It’s amber while charging, and white when the controller is fully charged.

Yep, the company is claiming that Google Cloud AI can help the four-time NBA champ, two-time MVP and two-time scoring champion get even better at basketball. According to the company, AI insights can analyze his shot quality as well as sharpen his workout plans. Google's AI Basketball Coach experience, its AI experiment that turns Gemini into a jump shot coach with help from Pixel cameras, will also analyze his form and give him visual feedback. The basketball icon already tried out AI Basketball Coach during Curry Camp, his three-day basketball camp where he mentors 30 student athletes from across the US. \"Through interactive demos and challenges, the next generation of athletes learned how our technology can help them elevate their game,\" Google said. Curry's partnership with Google goes beyond using AI to make him even better at his sport, though. Google is officially calling him a \"Performance Advisor,\" and he and his team will actively work with the company's health experts and product and AI engineers to help shape the future of Google Health and upcoming Fitbit models. The athlete's team will be testing Google's personal health coach and giving the company feedback on how to improve its ability to create tailored advice for each individual. They will be using Pixel phones, watches and buds, as well. Their input, Google said, will be used to \"fine-tune products, train algorithms and design future product experiences.\" This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-says-steph-curry-will-use-its-ai-to-get-better-at-basketball-141532440.html?src=rss", "ingested_utc": "2025-08-20T14:45:26Z"}

Whether you've stumbled upon air fryers for health reasons , convenience or you're already a card-carrying member of the air fryer clan, a sale is a great time to pick one up. We selected the COSORI as the runner-up for best air fryer overall , and were impressed with its six-quart capacity despite its relatively small footprint on the kitchen counter. Our reviewers found the basket was super roomy enough to fit quite a few chicken wings and a whole block of tofu without too much crowding. With nine different preset cooking modes to work with, the COSORI is a true workhorse. It has a preheat mode for starting a cook at a precise temperature, a proof option for home bakers, a dedicated frozen setting and more, including standard broil, bake and roast modes. The COSORI has some creature comforts that we really appreciated too, like an easy-to-use touchscreen, a basket release button and an auto-pause feature that turns off the cooking element when you release the basket. The air fryer craze doesn’t look to die down any time soon, and if you haven’t jumped on the bandwagon, now might be the right time to do so.
