Now it's not coming out until next spring. Developer Sad Cat Studio apologized for the delay and said that this is simply \"what's right for the project\" and that the team remains dedicated to creating a \"truly special experience.\" This isn't the first time the game has suffered a delay. It was originally announced back in 2021, with a pending release date of 2022 . That didn't happen. In 2024, the company announced a release date of 2025 . As today's news indicates, that also isn't going to happen. Why all of the delays? The company wants a polished finished product, sure, but the real world intervened on its original release plans. The company was based in Belarus before relocating after Russia's invasion of Ukraine . This was the primary factor behind those earlier delays. For the uninitiated, Replaced is a nifty-looking sidescrolling platformer that takes inspiration from old-school games like Out of this World (also called Another World ) and Flashback . It looks soaked in cyberpunk vibes. Assuming there are no more delays, it'll come out next year for PC and Xbox Series X/S. The trailers have gotten us amped for this one.

Today the company announced the next generation of its Jetson AGX system-on-module called Jetson Thor. The developer kit and T5000 production modules are computers designed for physical AI and robotics. The company has been iterating on these robot brains for a few years now , with each model more powerful than the last. The newest generation is powered by NVIDIA's Blackwell GPU architecture and offers 7.5 times more AI compute and 3.5 times greater energy efficiency than its predecessor, the Jetson Orin . These chips can run generative AI models, including large language and visual models, to help robots interpret the world around them. “We've built Jetson Thor for the millions of developers working on robotic systems that interact with and increasingly shape the physical world,” said NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang. The module is powered by NVIDIA's full-stack Jetson software platform , which is purpose-built for physical AI and robotics applications. The company counts Amazon, Meta, Agility Robotics and Boston Dynamics among its robotics clients using Jetson chips, which should give you an idea of who the target audience for this technology is. The Jetson AGX Thor is now on sale for $3,499 as a developer kit, and NVIDIA will sell the Thor T5000 modules for installation in production-ready robots. These will be sold at a wholesale price of $2,999 per module for a minimum order of 1,000 or more.
