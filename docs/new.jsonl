The launch window opens at 7:30PM ET (6:30PM CT). As always, the flight test will be livestreamed on the SpaceX website and on X, with a webcast starting 30 minutes before launch. The weather is looking iffy for launch, though, so don't be surprised if this one gets postponed; SpaceX said on Saturday that conditions were looking only 45 percent favorable. According to Space.com , the company has backup opportunities on August 25 and 26. Watch Starship's tenth flight test → https://t.co/UIwbeGoo2B https://t.co/gbQv9akMO9 — SpaceX (@SpaceX) August 15, 2025 Flight 10 follows a series of failures this year during SpaceX's seventh , eighth and ninth test flights. And in June, a Starship vehicle exploded on the ground during preparations for a static fire test of its six Raptor engines. If all goes according to plan for Flight 10, Starship will deploy eight dummy Starlink satellites and perform \"several experiments focused on enabling Starship’s upper stage to return to the launch site.\" It won't actually be returning to the launch site this time, though. The test is expected to last a little over an hour, and end with a splashdown in the Indian Ocean.
