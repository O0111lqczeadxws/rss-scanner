This is great news for those who want easy integration with other Android devices. It's also great news for app developers. The primary downside of Fire OS is that it mandates the use of its own app store. The custom nature of the OS requires developers to make separate versions of apps for Amazon tablets. This has severely limited the store's variety, especially when compared to the Google Play Store or the Apple App Store. The downside to all of this is likely the aforementioned $400 price tag. Fire tablets are known for being inexpensive. The Fire Tablet 7 costs $60 and sales can bring that down even further. The company's most expensive tablet is currently the Fire Max 11 , which costs $230. Amazon has declined to comment on the matter and we don't have any information regarding specs of the upcoming tablet. Hopefully the price increase translates to much better internals. This isn't the first time the company has given up on a product that used a proprietary operating system. The Fire Phone was released back in 2014 but failed to win over consumers. Amazon stopped selling the device in 2015 .

The standard PS5 (the one with with a disc drive) will now run you $550, up from $500. The Digital Edition is $500, up from $450. The PS5 Pro , meanwhile, will require you to fork over a whopping $750. That’s up from an already-eyewatering $700. In other words, each console got a $50 price bump. Sony says it’s rolling out the price increases due to (you guessed it) market uncertainty. \"Similar to many global businesses, we continue to navigate a challenging economic environment,\" it said in a blog post . \"As a result, we’ve made the difficult decision to increase the recommended retail price for PlayStation 5 consoles in the US starting on August 21.\" The silver lining to this is that Sony isn't increasing the prices of accessories for the time being. \"We have no other price changes to announce for additional markets,\" the company added. The company bumped up PS5 prices in the UK, Europe and Australia in April. It increased PS Plus prices in several markets that same month. So, it seemed the US was unlikely to be spared price hikes for much longer. Normally by this point in a console’s lifecycle, we would have seen a price cut. But nope, nearly five years into this generation and those who haven’t snapped up a PS5 or Xbox Series X/S now face the prospect of having to shell out more money for the consoles. The same goes for the Nintendo Switch, but at this point you'd likely be better off with a Switch 2, which costs just $60 more.
