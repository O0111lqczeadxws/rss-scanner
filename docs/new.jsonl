That's one of the lowest prices we've seen outside the big sales on Black Friday and Prime Day. For Apple users, AirTags offer some large advantages over rival trackers. The ultra-wideband functionality offers precise tracking with iPhones less than five years old, so you can narrow your search between a couch and love seat in the same room. Over larger distances, the AirTag network enabled by all Apple device users lets you track down an object you might have misplaced in a café. It offers a simple coin-sized design and seamless experience thanks to the Find My app. You can also force an AirTag to emit a chime to help you home in an object's location, and and that sound is nice and loud to better help you locate it. It does lack a built-in keyring like rival trackers, so you'll need to pay an extra for that. And it works best with Apple devices, so Android users may want to look at trackers from Chipolo or Pebblebee that use Google's Find My Device network . However, if you're in Apple's ecosystem and have been waiting for a discount, now is the time to act. Follow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice .

One way to avoid that is to keep a compact power bank on you at all times, and it's arguably easiest to do that with one like Anker's 621 MagGo portable battery . This sleek, 5K magnetic brick attaches to the back of your iPhone to power it up, even while you're still using it. Now, it's on sale for 30 percent off — you can pick up any of five coloways for only $28 a pop. This particular model didn't make our list of the best power banks , but plenty of other Anker products did. The 621 MagGo is equipped with magnets that attach to the back of certain iPhone models, which makes it easy to charge up the handset while still using it. The 5,000 mAh device can juice up the latest flagship iPhone 16 Pro Max to around 60 percent when fully charged. This is a thin and light device, so it's perfect for pockets, purses, backpacks and just about anywhere else. It charges up via an included USB-C cable. As a warning, the Anker 621 MagGo requires a magnetic connection via the smartphone itself or a magnetic case. It won't work with non-magnetic cases. It also runs a bit hot, reaching internal temperatures of up to 118 F, which could be something to keep an eye on during use. Follow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice .

Its 220-mile range and 215-horsepower output were middling at best when compared to vehicles like the Tesla Model Y . Its quirky styling didn't exactly help, either. For 2026, Subaru is giving the Solterra a significant up-do. Don't call it a reboot, as it's still very much the same SUV as before, but with more range, more power and better tech — all available at a starting price of $TKTK that barely changed. The result is a much more compelling car. Now, with Tesla's international appeal falling to an all-time low, which takes the Model Y off the table for many buyers, Subaru's first EV feels like it's finally found its time to shine. More of what you want Tim Stevens for Engadget I'm the first person to tell a potential EV buyer that range is not the first criterion they should be considering when EV shopping. There are many more important factors that impact your quality of life on a daily basis than how many charging stops you'll need to make on your annual road trip. Still, when the original Solterra was doing 220 miles on a charge, while the Tesla Model Y did well over 300, that made the thing a bit of a hard sell. Thankfully, the 2026 Solterra gets a big bump in that department, up to 288 miles on a charge. It’s not class-leading by any means, but as someone who's lived with EVs for years, I can confidently say that's plenty of juice to eliminate range anxiety for most. Impressively, the new Subaru does that on a battery pack that's barely any bigger: 74.7 kWh vs. 72.8 before. Where does the extra range come from, then? Subaru and Toyota engineers (this car is mechanically identical to the 2026 Toyota bZ ) deployed a raft of subtle improvements that result in substantial efficiency, everything from aerodynamic tweaks to updated electronics and new motors. When it's time to plug in, the Solterra and the Model Y can now use the same chargers. For 2026, the Solterra switches over to a Tesla-style NACS port, though the car comes with adapters for using J1772 and CCS ports. Outright charging speed is up by 50 percent over last year's car, but that only equates to a maximum charging rate of 150 kW. Again, it’s a big improvement, but not class-leading. It can at least burn those electrons more quickly. Outright power is up, with the Solterra now putting down 338 horsepower through all four wheels on the XT trims, a nice boost from the old car's 215. Big display, big safety Tim Stevens for Engadget All those updates are nice, but potential buyers will be more immediately wooed by a completely rethought dashboard layout that's still quirky but significantly less awkward than before. A new, 14-inch touchscreen dominates proceedings, giving you quick and easy access to everything from navigation to media playback. It serves as a generous canvas for either Android Auto or Apple CarPlay, both of which are offered wirelessly. There's not one but two wireless charging pads to keep your devices juiced while slinging tunes and navigation, plus a pair of USB-C ports in the second row for passengers. With 60 watts of output, back-seat productivity hounds can keep happily typing away even if they forgot their adapter. They'll be comfortable, too. There's a good amount of headroom and legroom in the rear seat, plus 23.8 cubic feet of cargo space in the rear. When it comes to keeping everyone safe, the new Solterra offers Subaru's EyeSight system standard, including automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control and a lane-centering system. I got a good chance to sample these systems in the increasingly heavy traffic in and around Denver, Colorado. The adaptive cruise brought the car to a complete stop and resumed on its own when traffic came to a crawl, while the active lane-keep system ensured the Solterra stayed centered. The drive Tim Stevens for Engadget For my day behind the wheel of the new Solterra, Subaru provided me with a model in top-shelf Touring XT trim, the highest performance. That meant I got to sample the car's full 338 horsepower, but I have to admit that in terms of acceleration, the thing still isn't a rocket ship. It has the instant torque of an EV and is certainly quick, but the power is delivered in a somewhat more relaxed way than many of the peppier EVs on the market today. That character continues throughout the Solterra drive experience. Steering is quite sharp and responsive, but the suspension doesn't really encourage any overly dramatic cornering antics. The traction and stability control systems quickly and abruptly kill all power at the first hint of loss of grip. For many Subaru enthusiasts, that's just when things start getting fun. It won't be a terror on your favorite gravel road, but the Solterra is reasonably competent when the asphalt ends. Subaru set up a short dirt course, which was more meander through the trees than proper expedition. Still, it proved the SUV capable on the sorts of terrain a mass-market machine like this is liable to see. In terms of comfort and ride quality, the Solterra handled most road imperfections and bumps without issue, but felt a little harsh over bigger stuff. There's no real wind noise or the like, making it a quiet and calm highway cruiser, but a fair bit of road noise did come up through the suspension on rougher stretches of asphalt. Wrap-up Tim Stevens for Engadget In many ways, this improved Solterra feels like the electric SUV that the brand should have launched in the first place. Better late than never. The big boost in range and performance, plus all the other tech and feature upgrades, make for a significantly improved car. It still comes up a little short of the competition from Hyundai or Tesla in terms of key metrics that EV shoppers tend to hyper-fixate on — particularly range — but it's close enough now to be judged on its other merits. Thankfully, those merits are good.

Some are better than others, and NordVPN sits squarely in the better category. Now, you can save up to 77 percent on most of NordVPN's plans. Arguably the best plan for most people is the NordVPN Plus plan , which you can get two years of access for only $108 right now. That's 73 percent off the usual rate, and NordVPN throws in an addition three months for free, so you're actually getting a 27-month subscription for the sale price. As well as Nord’s VPN service, a Plus plan also includes the Threat Protection Pro anti-malware tool, password management and an ad- and tracker-blocker. A Prime plan additionally comes with encrypted cloud storage or NordProtect, which insures you against identity theft and monitors dark web activity. That's also on sale — down to $189 on the same two-year commitment with those three additional months thrown in, which works out to a 77 percent savings on the regular price. When Engadget’s Sam Chapman reviewed NordVPN earlier this year, he praised its excellent download speeds, exclusive features and extensive server network. Less impressive is its clunky interface and inconsistent design when jumping between different platforms running a NordVPN app. While it doesn't quite make the cut in our guide to the best VPNs available right now, it generally performed well in speed tests and Threat Protection Pro is really worth having.

It’s more powerful and available in a larger size than the entry-level iPad, but a lot less expensive than the iPad Pro, which can be overkill for some. Right now, there's a great Apple iPad Air M3 price drop on Amazon: you can get one for $150 less than usual thanks to Labor Day sales . This deal applies to each configuration of the 11-inch and 13-inch versions of the most recent iPad Air. So, the 11-inch model is as low as $449, while the 13-inch model is down to $649. The same deals can be found at Best Buy and Target if you prefer to shop somewhere other than Amazon. This is an all-time low price and beats the deal we saw on Prime Day by $30. The iPad Air M3 is more of an iterative refresh than a grand overhaul, but the spec bump means it’ll last you a long time before the tablet’s performance becomes a problem. This iPad occupies the position of \"best for most\" in our iPad buying guide , reinforcing that goldilocks analogy. The M3 chip is the main draw here, with Geekbench 6 scores proclaiming it around 16 percent more powerful than the M2 iPad Air, which is no slouch itself. Beyond the chip, it has a superior display and speakers to the entry-level model , and wider accessory support. You also get the option of a 13-inch display, which is great for artists or anyone who sees the iPad as a viable laptop replacement. If there’s an obvious downside to the iPad Air M3, it’s that it doesn't have the nice 120Hz OLED display of the iPad Pro. This is hardly surprising, as Apple often focuses on display tech to differentiate its Pro and non-Pro devices, but it’s probably time the refresh rate on the middle-of-the-road iPad at least jumped up to ProMotion. Face ID is long overdue too. If you can live with these caveats, though, the iPad Air is an excellent option, particularly at this price. If you think the Air is too much for your needs, the iPad A16 , Apple's entry-level tablet, is down to $299 right now. It was slightly cheaper during Prime Day in July, but this discount is still worth considering if you're looking to pick up a newer iPad for less.
