Follow today’s news live Get our breaking news email , free app or daily news podcast In the last parliament, the government had just reached a deal with the Greens and members of the crossbench, to get its environmental laws over the line. Now that they’ve had to go back to the drawing board, the Coalition and the Greens will be approached for negotiation (as Murray Watt outlined a bit earlier). We need laws that actually act on the climate crisis, protect nature. And of course, we will always stand for making sure everyone’s got a home, a roof over their heads in this wealthy country. So the offer’s there. We’re looking forward to those discussions with government. Or they can choose to do a deal that will just pave the way for more big business profits, trash nature and leave ordinary people behind with the Libs. It’s very clear that targeting or hitting hospitals, health workers and civilians is a breach of international law. We join with the rest of the international community in condemning this action.

After being acquired by MediaLab in 2021, the once famously open-to-anything image-sharing service began placing restrictions on content in 2023. More recently, the site has experienced service issues, including problems with notifications. Many members of the Imgur community have claimed that MediaLab fired most of its US content moderation team in favor of AI, while others have said that the site is deleting or hiding content that is critical of the owner and its policies. The exact timeline, as well as what brought things to a tipping point, is still fuzzy at best. But for hours today, the Imgur homepage has been dominated by spammed images of a John Oliver meme in protest of what users see as MediaLab's poor management of the platform. Whatever team is currently working at Imgur appears to be unable to handle the rate that the memes are being posted, so it's anyone's guess how long the spam protest will dominate the front page.
