Even kids will tell you one Snickers is worth at least two Twix. But sometimes, as we'll see today, markets can go terribly wrong; greed can run out of control; lives can be at risk.

The Cloud Alpha 2 will last, according to its maker, for up to 250 hours on a full charge. While that number halves if you make use of the headsets’s simultaneous Bluetooth connectivity, a more than 10-day battery life is impressive for any wireless headset. Its new multi-layer 53mm drivers are engineered to reduce distortion as much as possible, while spatial audio is supported via HyperX’s Ngenuity software. The Cloud Alpha 2 isn’t actually the longest-lasting headset HyperX has made. The honor still belongs to its 2022 predecessor , which could last for up to 300 hours on a single charge. On paper, losing 50 hours of battery life on a newer headset could be viewed as a disappointment, but the Cloud Alpha 2’s ace card is its eye-catching RGB base station. With its colorful programmable buttons and pleasingly chunky-looking dial, you can tweak audio settings, launch shortcuts, adjust the volume and switch between connected devices. HyperX says the control station is the first of its kind on a wireless gaming headset. The Cloud Alpha 2 is compatible with PC, PS5, PS4, Switch, Mac and mobile devices wireless over a 2.4Ghz connection, as well as Xbox provided you’re happy to go wired. It comes with a detachable 10mm boom mic, but you won’t find any active noise-canceling tech built in. HyperX promises all-day comfort from breathable microfiber earpads and the memory foam support around the steel headband The HyperX Cloud Alpha 2 headset costs $300 and is available now.
