Two new features make it easier for Spotify's nearly 700 million users to share their favorite tunes. When sharing a Spotify track to Instagram Stories , a short snippet of the song will now be included. When people view the story, they'll have an option to open the track in Spotify. They can do that by tapping the music sticker on your post. Spotify Along similar lines, Instagram Notes now lets you show your friends what you're jamming out to. When creating a note, tap the music note symbol. Then, in the audio browser, choose \"Share from Spotify.\" The note will auto-update to show what you're listening to at that point. (Or, if you're not, it will display the next song you play within 30 minutes, so choose wisely.) Friends can tap your note to add the track to their Spotify likes. Inversely, Instagram integration is easier in the Spotify app. When sharing a currently playing track from there, a new Notes icon will appear next to other Instagram sharing options. The new features are available now (globally) on iOS and Android.
