The company teased a new smart speaker during its Pixel 10 launch event, and now Android Headlines has new images and details that confirm the look of the speaker and a collection of other Nest products that are on the way. Based on the images Android Headlines sourced, Google's new smart home lineup looks nearly identical to the cameras and doorbells it's already selling. The exception is the new smart speaker, now called the Google Home Speaker, which is smaller and rounder than the Nest Audio , and could be a replacement for the puck-shaped Nest Mini . The new speaker will come in what looks like red, light green, black and beige color options, and offer \"360-degree sound.\" Android Headlines writes that the speaker also supports Gemini Live, Sound Sensing for detecting smoke alarms or glass breaking and pairing with a Google TV Streamer . Google's not done releasing new products this year. üîä Google Home Speaker üì∏ Nest Cam Indoor (3rd Gen) üì∏ Nest Cam Outdoor (3rd Gen) üö™ Nest Doorbell wired More info: https://t.co/DUuZSduVhJ pic.twitter.com/dpVTrQoERA ‚Äî Androidheadline (@Androidheadline) August 25, 2025 The rest of the smart home lineup will feel familiar, save for some new colors, internal tweaks and software features. The biggest change is that all of the new Nest devices built-in cameras will reportedly record in 2K resolution, rather than 1080p. They'll also come in a selection of new colors. The Nest Cam Indoor comes in \"Snow\" (white), \"Berry\" (red) and \"Hazel\" (gray). The camera will include a new \"Zoom and Crop\" feature that lets you crop a camera feed to focus on a specific area, and be able to store up to an hour of footage locally if your Wi-Fi goes out. Google also plans to expand how long it'll store video previews of events Nest Cams detect, taking the library of 10-second previews from one hour to three. The Nest Cam Outdoor will only come in Snow and Hazel, but it'll reportedly include all the new features of the Nest Cam Indoor. The same goes for the new Nest Doorbell, except it'll be available in Snow, Hazel and \"Linen\" (beige). The decision to largely use the same design on its Nest devices and focus on changing internal components and software features is a similar strategy to what Google used with the Pixel 10 lineup . The phones largely look the same, but they feature improved internals and plenty of new software features. Android Headlines writes that Google plans to use this hardware launch to also rebrand its Nest Aware and Aware Plus subscriptions. The new name for Google's entry-level smart home subscription will be Google Home Premium. The company also plans to sell a Google Home Premium Advanced. As far as which subscription offers what, and if certain Gemini features will be locked behind a higher price, we'll have to wait until Google details its smart home plans. The company said Gemini for Home will launch in October, so expect more official announcements in the coming months.
