Despite the initial claims that the phone would be made in the United States, it seemed highly unlikely from the start that it was accurate. The \"Made in USA\" claims were quietly removed from the Trump Mobile website at a later date.

A third confusing image edit was posted on X earlier this week: That photo shows a Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra equipped with a case made by Spigen. The South Korean accessory company's logo can be seen behind the render of an American flag.
