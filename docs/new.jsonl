Amazon has a sale on the latest M4 MacBook Air that knocks up to 20 percent off many configurations. The base model is where you'll get the biggest discount. The 16GB RAM/256GB SSD laptop is down to $799 from $999, which is the lowest price we've seen. You can upgrade to 512GB SSD for $999 , down from $1,199, another all-time low price, or 24GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD for $1,199, down from $1,399. Then there's the 15-inch MacBook Air M4 , whose cheapest model is on sale for $999, dropping from $1,199. The 17 percent discount is the best deal we've seen since the pair debuted in March. As with the 13-inch model, the 16GB and 512GB SSD option is also a record-low price, dropping to $1,199 from $1,399. Then there's the 24GB upgrade , which is $1,399, down from $1,599. We're big fans of the MacBook Air M4, giving it a 92 in our review . Part of that comes from an already lower starting price for the MacBooks than their predecessors. The 2025 models also get a speed boost thanks to the M4 chip and are very thin with a 0.44-inch thickness. Neither the 13- or 15-inch will drag you down, weighing 2.7 pounds and 3.2 pounds, respectively. Plus, they both have excellent battery life, lasting over 18 hours while playing an HD video. The big differences in the 15-inch model mostly come down to size. The screen is obviously bigger, as is its trackpad. Other than that, it offers better speakers than its 13-inch sibling.
