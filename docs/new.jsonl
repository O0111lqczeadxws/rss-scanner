The H9 II headset has the same dynamic driver as the excellent Sony WH-1000XM6 headphones, and it sports a detachable mic. It can be used wired or as a Bluetooth wireless set. These headphones have active noise canceling and 360 Spatial Sound. It will retail for $350. The E9 monitor also offers 360 Spatial Sound and is designed for passive noise canceling. It costs $150. Fnatic's Valorant and Apex Legends teams assisted the creation of the audio products. Sam Rutherford for Engadget The company also has a new gaming mouse simply called Mouse-A that was designed with feedback from Fnatic pro players. The Mouse-A weighs a slight 48 grams and offers hybrid optical switches. The $150 mouse also has an 8,000Hz polling rate and promises up to 90 hours of battery life. For extra cushioning, Inzone has also unveiled two mousepads. The 6mm Mat-F is intended for strategic first person shooters and games that favor controlled stop and aim playstyles. The black design has a Slimflex base and will retail for $60. Mat-D costs $35 and is meant more for speedy gameplay with gliding movements.
