Ayaneo revealed the new Android gaming handheld, called the Pocket Fit Elite, in a YouTube video that detailed most of its specs. The Pocket Fit Elite will be built with a six-inch 1080p display that has a 144Hz refresh rate, an 8,000 mAh battery, and Hall effect joysticks and triggers. However, Ayaneo didn't confirm what processor it will use for the Pocket Fit Elite, whose name could be a nod towards the inclusion of the Snapdragon 8 Elite processor. We're expecting a more powerful chip than the Snapdragon G3 Gen 3 , which Ayaneo said will be used for the Pocket Fit base model that was announced in July. Looking at the two models, the unrevealed processor for the Pocket Fit Elite will be the main difference. Unlike the Ayaneo 3 and its $1,399 starting price, the Pocket Fit Elite will start at less than $399, while the Pocket Fit will be even cheaper with a sub-$329 starting price. Ayaneo said in its latest YouTube video that it's in the final preparation stage for the Pocket Fit launch, which will be sometime in September.
